# Chapter 7 — Maintaining & Evolving Ground Truth

Building ground truth is hard. Keeping it accurate, relevant, and trusted over time is harder.

Products evolve. Regulations change. Models get better — sometimes better than your existing ground truth. Teams grow, people leave, and institutional knowledge walks out the door. The ground truth you built six months ago may already be drifting from what your product actually needs today.

Most teams treat ground truth as a one-time project. Elite teams treat it as a living system with its own governance, versioning, review cadence, and maturity model. This chapter shows you how to maintain ground truth at scale — from drift detection to bias auditing, from freshness rules to LLM-as-Judge calibration.
