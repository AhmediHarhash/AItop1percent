# 2.6 — Mapping Your Product to the Right Tier

Here's a conversation I had last month with a product team that was stuck. They were building a financial planning assistant and couldn't decide what ground truth standard to use. "Is this Tier 0 because it's financial? Or Tier 2 because it's advisory? Or maybe Tier 3 because planning is creative?"

The answer was: yes. All of the above. Different features within the same product operate at different risk tiers, and trying to force the entire product into one tier was causing them to either over-engineer low-risk features or under-protect high-risk ones.

Most products don't fit neatly into a single tier. A banking chatbot might be Tier 3 when explaining investment concepts, Tier 2 when recommending investment strategies, Tier 1 when modifying account settings, and Tier 0 when executing trades. All within the same conversation.

Let me walk you through how to map your product's features to the right risk tiers, so you can apply appropriate ground truth standards to each.

## Why Single-Tier Classification Fails

The impulse to classify your whole product into one tier is understandable. It feels simpler. "We're a Tier 1 product" is cleaner than "We span Tiers 0 through 3 depending on the task."

But simplicity in classification creates complexity in execution. Here's what happens when you force a multi-tier product into a single tier:

**Classifying as the highest tier (over-protection):**

You look at your most critical feature — say, executing trades — and decide "We're a Tier 0 product." Now you apply Tier 0 standards to everything:

- Explaining what a stock option is → Requires expert review (waste)
- Recommending a diversified portfolio → Requires multiple annotators and exhaustive validation (overkill)
- Displaying transaction history → Requires zero-tolerance accuracy standards (unnecessary)
- Executing a trade → Requires Tier 0 rigor (appropriate)

You've correctly protected the high-risk feature but wasted enormous resources on the low-risk ones. Your annotation budget explodes. Shipping slows to a crawl. Features that should be quick wins become months-long projects.

**Classifying as the average tier (under-protection):**

You decide most of your product is advisory, so you're "a Tier 2 product." Now you apply Tier 2 standards to everything:

- Explaining concepts → Helpfulness ratings (appropriate)
- Recommending strategies → Multi-dimensional quality evaluation (appropriate)
- Modifying account settings → "Good enough" accuracy (risky)
- Executing trades → Approximate correctness acceptable (dangerous)

You've correctly calibrated most features but created serious risk in the high-stakes ones. A trade execution that's "mostly right" can cost users thousands. Under-protection on critical features is unacceptable.

**Classifying as the lowest tier (maximum under-protection):**

Some teams think "Most of what we do is low-stakes, so let's be efficient and treat everything as Tier 3." This is disaster:

- Creative exploration → Open-ended quality evaluation (appropriate)
- Advisory guidance → Helpfulness without rigor (maybe acceptable)
- Transactional changes → No accuracy requirements (broken)
- Critical actions → No safety standards (catastrophic)

This saves resources in the short term but creates liability, user harm, and eventual product failure.

The only path that works: map individual features to appropriate tiers and apply tier-specific standards to each.

## The Feature Mapping Exercise

Here's the practical process for mapping your product to risk tiers:

**Step 1: List all the tasks your AI handles**

Don't think in terms of "features" — think in terms of user tasks. What do users ask the AI to do?

For a financial planning assistant:
- Explain financial concepts
- Answer questions about account status
- Recommend investment strategies
- Suggest budget adjustments
- Calculate retirement projections
- Modify notification preferences
- Update profile information
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Execute investment trades
- Rebalance portfolio automatically

That's 10 distinct tasks, and they won't all be the same tier.

**Step 2: For each task, ask "What happens if this fails?"**

This is the key question that determines tier assignment.

"Explain financial concepts" — If explanation is unclear, user is confused but can ask follow-up questions or look elsewhere. No direct harm. → Likely Tier 2 or 3

"Answer questions about account status" — If the balance is wrong, user makes decisions based on bad information. Could lead to overdrafts or missed payments. → Likely Tier 1 (must be accurate, but if wrong, it's eventually catchable)

"Recommend investment strategies" — If recommendations are poor, user might make suboptimal investment decisions. But user ultimately decides. → Likely Tier 2

"Transfer funds between accounts" — If the amount or destination is wrong, user's money goes to the wrong place. Fixable but stressful and potentially costly. → Tier 1

"Execute investment trades" — If the trade is wrong (wrong stock, wrong quantity, wrong price), user loses money. Some trades are reversible but with costs. Time-sensitive. → Tier 0 or high Tier 1 depending on amount and reversibility

**Step 3: Consider reversibility and consequences**

For tasks where failure has consequences, assess:

**Can it be undone?**
- Easily reversed with no cost → Lower tier
- Reversed with friction, time, or cost → Tier 1
- Cannot be meaningfully reversed → Tier 0

**How quickly will the user notice?**
- Immediately or before consequences occur → Can catch and fix, lower tier
- Days or weeks later → Harder to catch, higher tier
- Never or too late to fix → Tier 0

**What's the worst-case impact?**
- Annoyance → Tier 1 or 2
- Financial loss (manageable) → Tier 1
- Financial loss (significant) → Tier 0
- Data loss → Tier 0
- Physical harm → Tier 0
- Legal liability → Tier 0

**Step 4: Assign each task to a tier**

Based on your analysis, map each task:

Financial planning assistant example:

**Tier 0 (zero tolerance):**
- Execute investment trades above $10,000
- Authorize fund transfers to external accounts
- Submit tax-related documents

**Tier 1 (low tolerance):**
- Execute investment trades under $10,000
- Transfer funds between own accounts
- Update profile information affecting legal/tax status
- Modify notification preferences for critical alerts

**Tier 2 (medium tolerance):**
- Recommend investment strategies
- Suggest budget adjustments
- Calculate retirement projections
- Answer questions about account status
- Explain financial concepts (technical)

**Tier 3 (exploratory):**
- Brainstorm financial goals
- Explore "what if" scenarios
- Explain financial concepts (conceptual)
- Discuss general financial philosophy

Notice that even "execute trades" is split — large trades are Tier 0, smaller trades are Tier 1 based on consequence magnitude.

**Step 5: Define ground truth standards per tier**

Now that tasks are mapped, you can apply the appropriate ground truth framework to each:

**Tier 0 tasks get:**
- Expert annotators (certified financial professionals)
- Multi-reviewer protocol (three reviewers)
- Zero-ambiguity requirement
- Exhaustive edge case coverage
- Mandatory human-in-the-loop
- Complete audit trails

**Tier 1 tasks get:**
- Domain-knowledgeable annotators
- Two-reviewer protocol
- 95-98% accuracy target
- Representative edge case coverage
- Clear confirmation UX
- Transaction logging

**Tier 2 tasks get:**
- User-representative annotators
- Single reviewer with spot-checks
- Helpfulness rating scales
- Factual accuracy verification
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment

**Tier 3 tasks get:**
- Creative/strategic judgment annotators
- Comparative ranking or multi-dimensional rating
- Diversity and coherence evaluation
- Content safety guardrails
- Engagement-based quality signals

## The Decision Tree Approach

If you have many tasks and mapping them individually feels overwhelming, use a decision tree to guide tier assignment:

**Start here: Does this task take an action that changes state in the world?**

→ No (it's informational/advisory) → Go to Branch A
→ Yes (it executes a transaction or change) → Go to Branch B

**Branch A (Informational/Advisory):**

**Is there a single correct answer?**

→ Yes (factual lookup) → Tier 2 (advisory with accuracy requirement)
→ No (multiple valid answers) → Tier 3 (exploratory)

**Does the information directly inform a high-stakes decision?**

→ Yes → Upgrade to Tier 2 with high accuracy standards
→ No → Stay in assigned tier

**Branch B (Action/Transactional):**

**Can the action be easily reversed without significant cost?**

→ Yes → Go to Branch B1
→ No → Go to Branch B2

**Branch B1 (Reversible):**

**Is the reversibility window wide (days/weeks)?**

→ Yes → Tier 1
→ No (hours or less) → High Tier 1 or Tier 0 depending on consequence

**What's the cost of being wrong?**

→ Minor annoyance → Tier 1
→ Significant frustration or moderate cost → High Tier 1
→ Major cost or harm → Tier 0 even if technically reversible

**Branch B2 (Not easily reversible):**

→ Automatically Tier 0

This decision tree covers most cases. Edge cases require judgment, but the tree provides a starting framework.

## Common Mistakes in Tier Assignment

Let me highlight mistakes I see teams make repeatedly:

**Mistake 1: Assigning tier based on domain rather than task**

"We're in healthcare, so everything is Tier 0."

No — providing general health information is Tier 2 or 3. Scheduling appointments might be Tier 1. Calculating drug dosages is Tier 0. The domain influences tier assignment, but it doesn't determine it. The specific task and its consequences determine tier.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring edge cases that escalate tiers**

"Transferring money is Tier 1 — it's reversible."

Usually true, but what about a transfer where the user's rent is due today and a wrong transfer means they miss the payment? Context can escalate a normally Tier 1 task to Tier 0. You need to recognize these escalation scenarios.

**Mistake 3: Treating all creative tasks as Tier 3**

"It's a writing assistant, so it's all Tier 3."

What if the writing assistant is generating legal disclaimers, medical consent forms, or financial disclosures? Suddenly there's a right and wrong answer based on legal requirements. Creative tools can have Tier 0 components when they intersect with regulated content.

**Mistake 4: Averaging when a task could go either way**

"This could be Tier 1 or Tier 2, so let's call it Tier 1.5."

Don't average. Decide which tier's standards are more appropriate. If consequences lean toward Tier 1, use Tier 1 standards. If helpfulness matters more than precision, use Tier 2. "Tier 1.5" doesn't give you a clear ground truth framework.

**Mistake 5: Assuming user perception determines tier**

"Users don't think of this as critical, so it's low-tier."

Users might not understand the stakes. If you're executing financial transactions, it's Tier 0 or 1 regardless of whether users treat it casually. Your job is to protect users, not to mirror their risk perception.

## Real Example: Healthcare Symptom Checker

Let me show you detailed tier mapping for a real product I worked with — a healthcare symptom checker that helps users understand symptoms and decide whether to seek care.

**Product overview:** Users input symptoms. The AI asks clarifying questions, then provides information about possible conditions and recommendations about urgency of care.

**Initial team assumption:** "We're in healthcare, this is all high-risk, we need Tier 0 standards for everything."

**Reality after task mapping:**

**Tier 3 tasks:**
- General health education ("What is blood pressure?")
- Wellness advice ("How can I sleep better?")
- Conceptual explanations ("What's the difference between virus and bacteria?")

Why Tier 3? No specific medical advice, just education. Multiple valid explanations exist. User is learning, not making care decisions.

Ground truth: Clarity and helpfulness ratings, factual accuracy verification, multiple annotators for medical fact-checking.

**Tier 2 tasks:**
- Explaining possible conditions based on symptoms
- Providing general guidance about condition management
- Answering questions about when symptoms typically warrant concern
- Recommending over-the-counter remedies for minor issues

Why Tier 2? Informational but health-relevant. User might make care decisions based on this, but they're not direct medical interventions. Multiple valid approaches exist.

Ground truth: Medical professional annotators rating helpfulness and accuracy, verification that advice aligns with clinical guidelines, checking that uncertainty is appropriately communicated.

**Tier 1 tasks:**
- Triaging symptom urgency (routine vs urgent vs emergency)
- Recommending when to see a doctor vs ER vs call 911
- Providing specific timeframes for seeking care

Why Tier 1? Direct impact on user behavior. Wrong triage could delay necessary care, but user still makes the final decision and has time to correct course. Mistakes are fixable but costly (delayed treatment, unnecessary ER visits).

Ground truth: Multiple physician reviewers, clear correctness standards based on clinical triage protocols, edge case coverage for ambiguous presentations, verification that recommendations are conservative (err toward caution).

**Tier 0 tasks:**
None. The product explicitly does not diagnose, prescribe, or direct treatment. If it did those things, they'd be Tier 0.

The key insight: Even a healthcare product has multiple tiers. The team was planning to apply Tier 0 rigor to health education content, which would have been wasteful and slow. By mapping tasks to appropriate tiers, they applied the right standards to each:

- Education content got creative/exploratory review
- Symptom information got advisory accuracy standards
- Triage recommendations got high-correctness clinical review
- The product avoided Tier 0 tasks entirely by not providing diagnosis/treatment

Result: Faster shipping, more efficient annotation spend, and appropriate safety levels for each task type.

## Real Example: Legal Document Assistant

Another detailed example: an AI that helps small businesses create legal documents.

**Product overview:** Users describe their situation. The AI generates contracts, terms of service, privacy policies, and other legal documents.

**Initial team assumption:** "Legal documents are high-stakes, everything should be Tier 0."

**Reality after task mapping:**

**Tier 3 tasks:**
- Explaining legal concepts in plain language
- Discussing general legal strategy
- Brainstorming contract structures
- Exploring different legal approaches

Why Tier 3? Educational and exploratory. No specific legal advice being applied to the user's situation yet.

Ground truth: Legal professionals rating clarity and helpfulness, factual accuracy of legal explanations, appropriateness of examples.

**Tier 2 tasks:**
- Recommending which document type fits user needs
- Explaining which clauses are standard vs optional
- Answering "Do I need X in my contract?" questions
- Providing general guidance about legal requirements

Why Tier 2? Advisory but not yet creating binding documents. User is informed to make decisions.

Ground truth: Attorney annotators rating whether recommendations align with standard practice, whether explanations are accurate, whether risk is appropriately communicated.

**Tier 1 tasks:**
- Generating standard documents for low-stakes situations (internal NDAs, simple contractor agreements)
- Customizing templates based on user input
- Creating documents that will be reviewed by attorneys before use

Why Tier 1? Creates actual documents but with expectation of review. Mistakes are correctable before signing/filing. Low-stakes scenarios where consequences are limited.

Ground truth: Multiple attorney reviewers, accuracy standards for legal requirements, verification that documents follow jurisdiction-specific rules, clear placeholders for attorney review.

**Tier 0 tasks:**
- Generating documents for high-stakes situations (major contracts, regulatory filings, employment agreements)
- Creating final documents ready to sign without review
- Submitting documents to courts or regulatory agencies

Why Tier 0? These documents create legal obligations or regulatory compliance. Mistakes can have severe consequences. Once signed/filed, reversal is costly or impossible.

Ground truth: Expert attorney review, multiple reviewers per document type, exhaustive edge case coverage, mandatory attorney confirmation before finalization, jurisdiction-specific validation.

**The implementation decision:**

The team realized they should:
- Support Tier 3 and 2 tasks broadly (education and guidance)
- Support Tier 1 tasks with clear "attorney review required" disclaimers
- Either exclude Tier 0 tasks or require in-app attorney review

They chose the latter: for Tier 0 documents, the AI generates a draft, then an in-network attorney reviews it for a fee before finalization. This keeps users in the platform while ensuring appropriate expertise for high-stakes documents.

Result: Clear tier boundaries, appropriate ground truth standards per tier, and a business model that provides value at each tier while managing risk.

## The Multi-Tier Product Mindset

Once you've mapped your product to tiers, you need to maintain this multi-tier mindset through development.

**Design considerations:**
- Make tier boundaries clear in the UX (users should understand when they're transitioning from advisory to transactional)
- Calibrate confirmation and friction to tier (more friction for higher-tier actions)
- Communicate risk appropriately ("This is for educational purposes" vs "This will execute a transaction")

**Development workflow:**
- Different tiers may need different development timelines (Tier 0 features take longer to validate)
- Different tiers may need different team expertise (Tier 0 might need domain experts on the team)
- Different tiers may need different release processes (Tier 0 might require more extensive testing)

**Ground truth workflow:**
- Maintain separate annotation pipelines per tier
- Use appropriate annotator pools per tier (experts for high tiers, user representatives for low tiers)
- Budget annotation resources proportional to risk, not frequency

**Quality monitoring:**
- Different tiers need different production monitoring (Tier 0 needs real-time monitoring, Tier 3 can use batch analysis)
- Different tiers need different quality metrics (accuracy for Tier 0-1, helpfulness for Tier 2-3)
- Different tiers might need different escalation protocols when quality issues arise

## When Product Evolution Changes Tiers

Products change over time, and tier assignments might change with them.

**Scenario 1: Adding higher-tier features**

Your Tier 2 advisory chatbot adds a Tier 1 booking feature. Now you need to:
- Build Tier 1 ground truth for the new feature
- Ensure tier boundaries are clear
- Update quality standards and monitoring
- Possibly upgrade overall infrastructure for higher-tier requirements

**Scenario 2: Increasing confidence in lower-tier features**

You've been treating something as Tier 1 conservatively. After extensive validation, you realize the reversibility window and consequences make it more Tier 2. You can:
- Reduce annotation rigor for that feature
- Reallocate saved resources to actual Tier 1 features
- Maintain safety while improving efficiency

**Scenario 3: Regulatory changes force tier escalation**

New regulations make a previously low-risk feature high-risk. You need to:
- Re-map the feature to a higher tier
- Rebuild ground truth to higher standards
- Update monitoring and safety controls
- Possibly gate the feature until higher-tier standards are met

The tier mapping isn't set in stone — it evolves with your product and the environment.

## Documentation for Your Tier Mapping

Once you've mapped your product to tiers, document it clearly. This document becomes your north star for ground truth development and quality standards.

**What to include:**

**Feature inventory with tier assignments:**
List every AI-powered task, its tier, and the rationale for that tier.

**Tier escalation scenarios:**
Document situations where a normally low-tier task becomes higher-tier (time pressure, high amounts, vulnerable users, etc.).

**Ground truth requirements per tier:**
For each tier your product uses, specify annotator requirements, review protocols, quality targets, and validation procedures.

**Tier boundaries in UX:**
Show how tier transitions are communicated to users in the interface.

**Quality metrics per tier:**
Define what success looks like for each tier (accuracy targets for Tier 0-1, helpfulness benchmarks for Tier 2-3).

**Review and update process:**
Set a schedule for reviewing tier assignments (quarterly or when major features ship) to ensure they remain appropriate.

This documentation serves multiple purposes:
- Aligns team on risk understanding
- Guides annotation work
- Informs product decisions
- Provides regulatory evidence (showing you've considered risk systematically)
- Onboards new team members

## If You Skip This, Here's What Happens

Teams that don't map their product to tiers face:

**Resource misallocation:** Spending annotation budget on low-risk features while under-investing in high-risk ones.

**Shipping delays:** Over-engineering every feature to the highest standard slows everything down.

**Hidden vulnerabilities:** Under-protecting high-risk features because you're using an averaged standard.

**Team confusion:** Engineers don't know what quality bar to hit, annotators don't know how rigorous to be, product managers can't prioritize effectively.

**Regulatory risk:** When auditors ask "How did you determine appropriate controls?" having no systematic tier mapping is a red flag.

The mapping exercise takes a few hours but saves months of wasted effort and prevents serious safety gaps. Do it early, document it clearly, and revisit it as your product evolves.

Next, we'll tackle the hardest real-world challenge: what happens when a single user conversation crosses multiple tier boundaries mid-flow, and how to design systems that handle these transitions gracefully.
