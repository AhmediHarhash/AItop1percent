# 1.7 — Who Owns Ground Truth (And Why It Matters)

I've watched the same meeting play out at a dozen companies. The team gathers to discuss their AI product's quality. Someone says: "We need to improve our ground truth."

An engineer responds: "I can update the eval criteria in our test suite."

A product manager interrupts: "Actually, this is a product decision about what users need."

A data scientist chimes in: "Ground truth is fundamentally a data labeling question."

Legal adds: "We need to review any quality standards for compliance."

A domain expert says: "You can't define correctness without subject matter expertise."

Twenty minutes later, everyone's frustrated because they're all right and all wrong. The problem isn't that nobody wants to own ground truth. The problem is that everyone thinks it's their domain while nobody has clear ownership.

When nobody owns ground truth, everybody defines it differently. And when everybody defines it differently, you don't actually have ground truth—you have a collection of conflicting opinions.

## The Nobody-Owns-It Disaster

Let me show you what happens when ground truth ownership is unclear.

A company builds a customer service chatbot. Engineering defines ground truth as "technically accurate responses that retrieve correct information from the knowledge base." They build evals around retrieval accuracy and response coherence.

Product defines ground truth as "responses that resolve customer issues without human escalation." They track escalation rates as their quality metric.

Customer success defines ground truth as "responses that leave customers satisfied." They use CSAT scores.

Legal defines ground truth as "responses that don't create liability." They review for compliance violations.

The domain experts (customer service team leads) define ground truth as "responses that match how our best agents would handle it." They evaluate based on agent-like quality.

Five different groups, five different definitions, five different evaluation methods. Nobody's aligned. When quality problems arise, everyone has different data showing different things. Decisions become political instead of evidence-based.

The company ships. Users complain. They have a retro meeting. Everyone brings their metrics:

Engineering: "Retrieval accuracy is 94%, system is working great."
Product: "Escalation rate is 18%, way too high."
Customer success: "CSAT is down 12 points, users are unhappy."
Legal: "We've had three compliance flags this month."
Domain experts: "The responses don't sound like how we'd actually help customers."

Who's right? Everyone. Who's responsible for fixing it? Nobody knows, because nobody owns the definition of correct.

## The Ownership Models

There are three main ownership models I've seen work. Each has trade-offs.

Model 1: Centralized Ownership

One team owns ground truth across the entire organization. Usually this is a dedicated AI quality team, a data science team, or sometimes product operations.

Advantages:
- Consistency across products
- Clear accountability
- Efficient updates and versioning
- Systematic approach to methodology
- Easier to enforce standards

Disadvantages:
- Can become a bottleneck
- May lack domain expertise for specialized products
- Risk of becoming disconnected from product reality
- Can feel like ivory tower dictating to practitioners

This model works best for organizations with multiple AI products that need consistency, or for highly regulated industries where standardization matters.

Model 2: Federated Ownership

Each product team owns ground truth for their product. Domain experts within each team define what "correct" means for their specific use case.

Advantages:
- Domain expertise embedded in decisions
- Faster iteration without cross-team dependencies
- Ground truth closely matches product needs
- Ownership feels natural to product teams

Disadvantages:
- Inconsistency across products
- Duplication of effort
- Harder to share learnings
- Variable quality across teams

This model works best for organizations with very different product types where shared standards don't make sense, or for smaller companies where centralization overhead isn't worth it.

Model 3: Hybrid Ownership

A central team owns the framework, methodology, and shared components. Product teams own the specific criteria for their domains within that framework.

Advantages:
- Balances consistency with flexibility
- Central team provides expertise and infrastructure
- Product teams maintain domain ownership
- Scales well as organization grows

Disadvantages:
- Requires clear interface between central and federated responsibilities
- Can be confusing without explicit boundaries
- Needs strong communication between teams

This model works best for medium to large organizations with diverse products but shared quality infrastructure needs.

## The 2026 Reality: EU AI Act Compliance

As of 2026, the EU AI Act adds a legal dimension to ownership. For high-risk AI systems, you must:

- Document quality standards (ground truth)
- Assign clear responsibility for those standards
- Maintain records of who approved what
- Have accountable individuals for compliance

You can't have vague ownership anymore. The regulation requires named responsible parties. This pushes organizations toward clearer ownership structures.

In practice, most organizations subject to the Act are adopting hybrid models with:
- A Chief AI Officer or equivalent who owns overall quality frameworks
- Product teams who own specific criteria within the framework
- A compliance team who reviews and approves ground truth for high-risk systems
- Documentation showing who approved what and when

## The Ownership Decision Matrix

How do you decide which model fits your organization? Consider these factors:

Factor 1: Number and diversity of AI products

- One product or similar products? Centralized or federated works.
- Many diverse products? Hybrid or federated works better.

Factor 2: Regulatory environment

- Highly regulated (healthcare, finance)? Centralized or hybrid with strong central oversight.
- Lightly regulated? Federated can work.

Factor 3: Organization size

- Small (under 50 people)? Federated or light central with one owner.
- Medium (50-500)? Hybrid usually optimal.
- Large (500+)? Hybrid with robust central function.

Factor 4: Domain expertise distribution

- Expertise concentrated in central team? Centralized.
- Expertise distributed across product teams? Federated or hybrid.

Factor 5: Need for consistency

- Multiple products with shared users? Centralized or strong hybrid.
- Separate user bases per product? Federated can work.

## The RACI Framework for Ground Truth

Regardless of which ownership model you choose, use a RACI framework to clarify roles:

Responsible: Who does the work of defining and maintaining ground truth?
Accountable: Who ultimately approves and owns the decision?
Consulted: Who provides input and expertise?
Informed: Who needs to know about changes?

Here's what this looks like in practice for a customer service bot:

Responsible: AI product manager works with customer service leads to draft ground truth criteria
Accountable: VP of Product approves ground truth definition
Consulted: Engineering (feasibility), Legal (compliance), Data Science (measurability), Customer Success (user needs)
Informed: Labeling team, engineering team, executive leadership

Now everyone knows their role. Decisions don't get stuck in unclear ownership.

## The Domain Expert Problem

Here's a trap: assuming domain experts should own ground truth.

Domain experts know what good looks like. They're essential for defining ground truth. But they're not always the right owners.

Why? Because ground truth ownership requires:
- Ongoing maintenance and versioning
- Integration with eval infrastructure
- Stakeholder coordination
- Measurement and iteration
- Documentation and communication

These are product management and program management skills, not domain expertise skills.

The best model: domain experts are consulted and provide approval for content, but a product or program manager owns the process and documentation.

## The Stakeholder Map

Whoever owns ground truth needs to manage these stakeholders:

Product team: Defines what success means for users
Engineering team: Builds systems to meet ground truth
Data team: Labels and measures against ground truth
Domain experts: Validate that criteria reflect true quality
Legal/Compliance: Ensures criteria meet regulatory requirements
Leadership: Approves trade-offs and priorities
Customers/Users: Ultimate arbiters of usefulness (via feedback)

The owner doesn't define ground truth alone. They orchestrate input from all stakeholders and drive to consensus.

## The Bottleneck Risk

Centralized ownership creates a bottleneck risk. If one team owns all ground truth and you have five products all needing updates, they can't keep up.

Mitigations:

1. Clear prioritization framework. Not all ground truth updates are equally urgent. Define what warrants immediate attention vs. quarterly review.

2. Self-service templates. The central team provides frameworks and templates that product teams can use to draft their own ground truth, subject to central review.

3. Tiered review process. Minor updates (clarifications, examples) can be approved by product teams. Major updates (new criteria, changed standards) need central approval.

4. Dedicated capacity. If ground truth ownership is someone's side task, it won't get done. Allocate real time and resources.

## The Accountability Clarity

Here's the test of whether ownership is clear: something goes wrong in production because ground truth was insufficient. Who gets paged?

If the answer is "unclear" or "everyone," ownership isn't clear.

If the answer is a specific person or team who owns improving ground truth as a result, ownership is clear.

Make this explicit. Write down: "The owner of ground truth for Product X is [name/team]. They are responsible for maintaining quality standards and accountable for ensuring ground truth is fit for purpose."

## The Cross-Functional Tension

Different functions have different incentives around ground truth:

Engineering wants ground truth that's technically measurable and automatable. They prefer objective criteria over subjective ones.

Product wants ground truth that aligns with user needs and business metrics. They're willing to accept some subjectivity if it matches real success.

Legal wants ground truth that minimizes risk and ensures compliance. They're conservative and risk-averse.

Domain experts want ground truth that matches professional standards. They resist dumbing down quality for measurability.

Leadership wants ground truth that's achievable with available resources. They balance quality against cost and speed.

The owner's job is navigating these tensions and making trade-offs explicit. Not everyone will be happy. That's fine. Unclear trade-offs where everyone gets a veto are worse than clear decisions where some stakeholders are unhappy.

## The Update Authority

Who can change ground truth? This must be explicit.

Bad model: Anyone can update the ground truth doc as they see fit. This leads to drift, conflicts, and unclear versioning.

Better model: There's a defined approval process. Anyone can propose changes, but changes require review and approval from the owner plus key stakeholders.

Best model: There's a lightweight process for minor clarifications and a heavyweight process for substantive changes, with clear definitions of what constitutes each.

Example:

Minor changes (owner approval only):
- Adding examples to clarify existing criteria
- Fixing typos or formatting
- Reorganizing without changing content

Medium changes (owner + domain expert approval):
- Adjusting criteria within existing framework
- Adding criteria for new edge cases
- Updating for minor policy changes

Major changes (owner + stakeholder review + leadership approval):
- Changing core quality standards
- Adding or removing entire criteria categories
- Updates driven by regulatory changes

## The Transition Problem

What happens when ownership transfers? Someone leaves, org restructures, priorities shift.

Without proper knowledge transfer, ground truth becomes orphaned. Nobody knows the reasoning behind specific decisions. Historical context is lost.

Mitigations:

1. Document reasoning, not just decisions. In the ground truth doc, explain WHY each criterion matters. Future owners can understand intent.

2. Maintain a decision log. When trade-offs are made, document what alternatives were considered and why the chosen option won.

3. Regular stakeholder reviews. If key stakeholders review ground truth quarterly, they maintain knowledge even as owners change.

4. Structured handoff process. When ownership transfers, include ground truth in the handoff with review of recent decisions and open questions.

## The Small Company Reality

In small companies (under 30 people), formal ownership structures feel like overkill. You might not have separate product, engineering, and data teams.

The pattern that works: one person owns ground truth as an explicit responsibility (even if it's 10% of their job), and they convene stakeholders as needed.

Don't skip ownership just because you're small. The smaller you are, the more important clear ownership is, because there's less redundancy if things fall through the cracks.

## The Enterprise Reality

In large enterprises, ground truth ownership often sits within:

- A central AI/ML platform team
- Product operations or program management
- A dedicated AI quality or trust & safety team
- Sometimes even legal or compliance for high-risk systems

The key success factor isn't where it sits—it's that wherever it sits has:
- Real authority to drive decisions
- Direct access to domain expertise
- Connection to product and engineering
- Resources to do the work
- Executive sponsorship when conflicts arise

## What Elite Teams Do

Let me show you what best-in-class ownership looks like:

They assign explicit ownership in writing. It's in job descriptions, OKRs, and team charters. Ground truth isn't "everyone's job"—it's someone's job.

They give owners authority commensurate with responsibility. If you own ground truth, you can convene stakeholders, drive decisions, and allocate labeling budget.

They create rituals around ground truth. Monthly review meetings, quarterly stakeholder alignment, annual deep dives. Ownership means process, not just accountability.

They separate ownership from execution. The owner doesn't have to write all the criteria themselves. They ensure it gets done well and stakeholders are aligned.

They make ownership visible. Everyone knows who owns ground truth. It's documented, announced, and understood.

They resource ownership appropriately. If ground truth is 20% of the product, it's at least 20% of someone's job, not a side task.

## The Warning Signs

You have unclear ground truth ownership if:

- Multiple teams have different quality metrics with no reconciliation
- Updates to ground truth happen ad-hoc without clear process
- You can't name who would approve a ground truth change
- Different evaluators apply different standards
- Product decisions about quality are made without ground truth input
- Ground truth hasn't been reviewed in 6+ months despite product changes

If you're seeing these signs, clarify ownership before trying to improve ground truth itself.

## The Ownership Charter

Document ground truth ownership in a charter that includes:

- Who owns ground truth (person and role)
- What ownership entails (responsibilities)
- Who they must consult (stakeholders)
- How changes are approved (process)
- How often review happens (cadence)
- How conflicts are resolved (escalation path)
- What resources they control (budget, time)

This charter makes implicit ownership explicit and reduces confusion.

## The Executive Sponsor Requirement

Ground truth ownership needs executive sponsorship. Here's why:

Ground truth decisions involve trade-offs between product teams, engineering constraints, legal requirements, and business goals. Those trade-offs sometimes require executive decision-making.

If the ground truth owner doesn't have an executive sponsor who can break ties and enforce decisions, they're a coordinator without authority. That doesn't work.

The sponsor doesn't need to be the CEO. But it needs to be someone with enough authority to make calls when stakeholders disagree.

## The Bottom Line

The question "who owns ground truth?" seems administrative. It's actually foundational.

When ownership is unclear:
- Ground truth drifts into inconsistency
- Updates happen haphazardly or not at all
- Stakeholder conflicts don't get resolved
- Accountability is diffuse when things go wrong
- Quality becomes everyone's concern and nobody's responsibility

When ownership is clear:
- There's one source of truth (the ground truth doc)
- There's a process for updates and improvements
- Stakeholders know how to provide input
- Decisions get made and stuck to
- Quality improves systematically

Don't build ground truth and hope someone maintains it. Assign ownership, give them authority and resources, and make them accountable for quality of the quality standards.

In the next section, we'll put numbers on the cost of undefined ground truth. It's easy to treat ground truth as a nice-to-have. When you see the actual cost of skipping it—in wasted engineering time, delayed launches, and production incidents—the priority becomes obvious.
