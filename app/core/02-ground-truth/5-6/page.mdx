# 5.6 — Cross-Functional Ground Truth Ownership

Six months after getting executive buy-in for ground truth work, a team was struggling. They had the budget. They had the people. They even had good initial momentum. But ground truth quality was deteriorating and nobody seemed to own fixing it.

Engineering said: "We built the evaluation infrastructure like you asked. It's Product's job to define what good looks like."

Product said: "We defined requirements. It's the domain experts' job to validate accuracy."

Domain experts said: "We reviewed examples when asked. It's Engineering's job to make sure the system uses them correctly."

Legal said: "We flagged compliance issues. It's everyone's job to address them."

Meanwhile, the ground truth datasets were getting stale, evaluation criteria were drifting from actual product needs, and the same quality issues kept slipping through.

This is the ownership vacuum. When ground truth is everyone's responsibility, it's nobody's responsibility.

## Why Cross-Functional Ownership Is Hard

Ground truth is inherently cross-functional. It requires:

- Domain expertise to define what's correct
- Product knowledge to define what's useful
- Engineering capability to implement evaluation
- Legal/compliance input to ensure safety
- Design perspective to ensure usability
- Customer-facing team input to ensure real-world applicability

No single function can own it completely. But pure committee ownership leads to diffusion of responsibility.

I've seen teams try three approaches: centralized ownership (one team owns everything), federated ownership (each team owns their piece), and hybrid models (central framework, distributed execution). Let me walk you through what works, what doesn't, and when to use each.

## Model One: Centralized Ownership (Works at Small Scale)

In the centralized model, one team owns all ground truth work. This team:

- Runs alignment workshops
- Creates and maintains ground truth datasets
- Defines evaluation criteria
- Builds and operates evaluation infrastructure
- Coordinates with stakeholders but makes final decisions

This model works beautifully when:

- Your company is small (under fifty people)
- You have a single AI product or a few closely related products
- The domain isn't too specialized (one or two people can develop sufficient expertise)
- Iteration speed is more important than perfect domain coverage

I worked with a startup with twenty people building a meeting notes AI. They had one "AI Quality Lead" who owned all ground truth. She ran workshops with the team, created datasets, defined standards, and operated the evaluation system.

It worked because the domain wasn't hyper-specialized (anyone could learn what good meeting notes look like), the team was small enough that one person could coordinate with everyone, and they valued moving fast over perfect comprehensiveness.

The advantages of centralized ownership:

Clear accountability. When ground truth is wrong, you know exactly who to talk to.

Consistency. One person or one small team ensures ground truth stays coherent and standards don't drift.

Efficiency. You're not coordinating across multiple teams, so decisions happen faster.

Institutional knowledge. The ground truth expertise lives in one place, not scattered across the organization.

The disadvantages of centralized ownership:

Doesn't scale. One team can't maintain ground truth for dozens of AI products across diverse domains.

Domain expertise bottleneck. The central team might lack deep expertise in specialized domains.

Disconnect from product. If the central team is too separated from product development, ground truth can drift from actual needs.

Single point of failure. If the central team's capacity is maxed out or key people leave, the whole system breaks.

If you're a small team (under thirty people) or you're just starting ground truth work, start with centralized ownership. As you grow, you'll evolve to federated or hybrid models.

## Model Two: Federated Ownership (Works at Medium to Large Scale)

In the federated model, each product team or domain team owns their own ground truth. There might be shared standards or frameworks, but execution is distributed.

This model works when:

- You have multiple distinct AI products or use cases
- Different products serve different domains (medical, legal, financial, etc.)
- Teams are mature enough to own quality end-to-end
- You need deep domain expertise that a central team can't reasonably develop

I worked with a healthcare company with five AI products: a symptom checker, a medication information chatbot, a clinical decision support tool, a patient education system, and an administrative assistant for scheduling.

Each product team owned their ground truth:

- The symptom checker team included medical doctors who defined clinical accuracy standards
- The medication team included pharmacists who defined drug interaction and dosing standards
- The clinical decision support team included specialists who defined evidence-based care standards

Each team had different evaluation criteria, different edge cases, different risk tolerances. Centralizing would have been a disaster — no central team could develop sufficient expertise across all these domains.

Instead, they had a lightweight central team that provided:

- Shared evaluation infrastructure (tools and platforms)
- Frameworks and best practices
- Cross-team learning and knowledge sharing
- Escalation for cross-product consistency questions

But the actual ground truth definition and maintenance was federated to product teams.

The advantages of federated ownership:

Scales well. Each team maintains their own ground truth, so you're not bottlenecked by central capacity.

Deep domain expertise. Teams can have the specialized knowledge needed for their domain.

Close to product. The team building the product owns the quality standards, ensuring tight alignment.

Autonomy. Teams can move at their own pace and make decisions without cross-functional coordination overhead.

The disadvantages of federated ownership:

Inconsistency. Different teams might use different frameworks, making it hard to compare or combine ground truth.

Duplication of effort. Teams might solve the same problems independently instead of sharing solutions.

Uneven quality. Some teams will be great at ground truth work, others will struggle, and there's no central authority ensuring baseline quality.

Knowledge fragmentation. Expertise lives in silos, making it hard for teams to learn from each other.

If you have multiple distinct products or specialized domains, federated ownership is the right model. But you need that lightweight central team to prevent total chaos.

## Model Three: Hybrid Ownership (Best for Most Organizations)

The hybrid model combines central framework-setting with distributed execution. A central team owns:

- The evaluation framework (what dimensions to evaluate, how to structure ground truth)
- Shared tooling and infrastructure
- Cross-functional standards (safety, compliance, brand voice)
- Training and enablement for distributed teams
- Quality audits and consistency checks

Domain teams own:

- Creating domain-specific ground truth examples
- Defining domain-specific evaluation criteria
- Validating accuracy and relevance for their use case
- Maintaining and updating their ground truth as the product evolves

This is the model I see working best for most organizations beyond the very early stage.

Let me show you what this looks like at a company I advised. They built a customer service AI platform used across multiple industries — retail, banking, healthcare, telecommunications.

The central "AI Quality" team (three people) owned:

Framework: "All ground truth must include these standard dimensions: accuracy, helpfulness, safety, compliance, tone. Teams can add domain-specific dimensions."

Tooling: A shared platform for creating, storing, and running evaluations against ground truth.

Cross-cutting standards: "All responses must meet these safety standards. All responses must use inclusive language. All responses must follow our brand voice guidelines."

Training: Workshops and documentation teaching teams how to create good ground truth.

Audits: Quarterly reviews of each team's ground truth to ensure quality and consistency.

Each product team (retail AI, banking AI, healthcare AI, etc.) owned:

Domain-specific ground truth: The retail team created examples of good product recommendations, returns handling, and inventory questions. The banking team created examples of account questions, fraud concerns, and financial advice.

Domain-specific criteria: The healthcare team defined clinical accuracy standards with medical advisors. The banking team defined regulatory compliance standards with their legal team.

Maintenance: As products evolved, teams updated their ground truth to reflect new features and changing user needs.

This hybrid model gave them the benefits of centralized consistency without the bottleneck of centralized execution.

The advantages of hybrid ownership:

Scalability with consistency. Teams can work independently but within a shared framework.

Specialized expertise where needed. Domain teams bring deep knowledge while the central team ensures cross-functional quality.

Shared learning. The central team can propagate best practices across all teams.

Clear accountability. The framework says who owns what, so there's no confusion.

The disadvantages of hybrid ownership:

Coordination overhead. You need clear interfaces between central and distributed teams.

Potential for conflict. When central standards and domain needs conflict, you need escalation paths.

Requires organizational maturity. Teams need to be capable of owning their ground truth with lightweight central support.

For most organizations with more than one AI product and more than thirty people, hybrid ownership is the sweet spot.

## The RACI Matrix for Ground Truth

Regardless of which model you choose, you need clarity on who's Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for different ground truth activities.

Here's a template RACI for hybrid ownership:

Creating initial ground truth examples:
- Responsible: Domain team
- Accountable: Product lead for that domain
- Consulted: Central quality team, legal, design
- Informed: Engineering, stakeholders

Defining evaluation criteria:
- Responsible: Domain team with central quality team
- Accountable: Product lead
- Consulted: Legal, domain experts, customer-facing teams
- Informed: Engineering, leadership

Building evaluation infrastructure:
- Responsible: Engineering
- Accountable: Engineering lead
- Consulted: Central quality team, product teams
- Informed: All stakeholders

Running evaluations:
- Responsible: Domain team or engineering (depending on automation)
- Accountable: Product lead
- Consulted: Central quality team
- Informed: Stakeholders

Updating ground truth:
- Responsible: Domain team
- Accountable: Product lead
- Consulted: Central quality team, domain experts
- Informed: Engineering, stakeholders

Resolving cross-product consistency issues:
- Responsible: Central quality team
- Accountable: Head of product or CPO
- Consulted: Affected domain teams
- Informed: Leadership

Quality audits:
- Responsible: Central quality team
- Accountable: Head of quality or CPO
- Consulted: Domain teams
- Informed: Leadership

Adapt this RACI to your specific organization, but the key is documenting it explicitly so everyone knows who owns what.

## The Ground Truth Steward Role

Here's a role I've seen work really well: the Ground Truth Steward.

This is a person (or in larger orgs, a small team) who's responsible for:

- Maintaining the health of ground truth datasets
- Coordinating cross-functional input
- Ensuring ground truth stays aligned with product evolution
- Identifying when ground truth needs updating
- Facilitating alignment workshops
- Tracking ground truth coverage and quality

This person is part project manager, part quality advocate, part domain expert. They don't own every decision, but they own making sure decisions get made and documented.

In the centralized model, this is probably a dedicated full-time role. In the federated model, each team might have a part-time steward. In the hybrid model, you might have a central steward plus distributed stewards on each product team.

The key attributes of a good ground truth steward:

Cross-functional respect. They need to be able to work effectively with engineering, product, legal, design, and domain experts.

Detail-oriented. Ground truth work requires care and precision.

Product-minded. They need to understand how ground truth connects to product outcomes.

Comfortable with ambiguity. A lot of ground truth work involves navigating subjective judgments and conflicting priorities.

Persistent. Ground truth maintenance is unglamorous ongoing work. The steward needs to keep pushing when attention drifts.

One company I worked with created a "Quality Engineering" role that combined traditional QA skills with ground truth stewardship. These people embedded with product teams, helped define ground truth, built evaluation tests, and ensured quality throughout the development cycle. It worked brilliantly.

## What Happens When Ownership Is Unclear

Let me show you what goes wrong when you don't define ownership clearly.

Scenario one: The stale dataset problem. Ground truth was created eighteen months ago and nobody's updated it. The product has evolved, user needs have changed, but the ground truth still reflects old assumptions. Nobody thinks it's their job to maintain it.

Scenario two: The coverage gap problem. Nobody's responsible for ensuring ground truth covers all important use cases. Teams create ground truth for happy path cases and ignore edge cases. Gaps go unnoticed until production incidents happen.

Scenario three: The consistency drift problem. Different teams or different people create ground truth using different standards. Over time, the standards drift and ground truth becomes incoherent.

Scenario four: The ghost town problem. Ground truth infrastructure was built, datasets were created, then everyone moved on to other priorities. The infrastructure sits unused because nobody's job is to actually use it.

Scenario five: The political paralysis problem. When ground truth decisions require consensus from multiple teams with no clear decision-maker, decisions don't get made. Teams endlessly debate without resolution.

All of these problems stem from unclear ownership. The solution is explicit, documented ownership with accountability.

## Ownership at Different Company Sizes

Let me give you specific recommendations based on company size.

Under thirty people: Centralized ownership. One person or one small team owns all ground truth. This person probably wears other hats too (maybe they're also QA, or product ops, or an engineering lead). This is fine — at this size, you don't need full-time dedicated ownership.

Thirty to one hundred people: Hybrid ownership starting to emerge. You probably have a central person or small team, but product teams are starting to own domain-specific pieces. The central team provides framework and tooling, product teams execute.

One hundred to three hundred people: Hybrid ownership fully implemented. You have a small central quality team (two to four people) and each product team has a designated ground truth steward (probably part-time). Clear RACI, regular sync meetings, shared infrastructure.

Over three hundred people: Federated ownership with strong central standards. Product teams own their ground truth end-to-end, but there's a central team setting standards, auditing quality, and ensuring consistency. Possibly dedicated full-time ground truth stewards on major product teams.

These are guidelines, not rules. Adjust based on your product complexity, domain specialization, and organizational maturity.

## The Ownership Evolution Path

Most teams evolve through ownership models as they grow. Here's the typical path:

Phase one: Informal ownership. Someone on the team cares about quality and does ground truth work ad hoc. This works for the first few months.

Phase two: Designated ownership. One person is formally made responsible for ground truth. They create initial frameworks and datasets.

Phase three: Centralized ownership. As the work grows, the designated person gets help. A small central team forms.

Phase four: Hybrid ownership emerges. As you add more products or scale up, central team can't do everything. You start distributing execution while maintaining central standards.

Phase five: Federated ownership with central support. Product teams are fully capable of owning their ground truth. Central team shifts from doing the work to enabling others to do it well.

Don't skip phases. You can't jump from informal to fully federated without the intermediate steps. Teams need to build the muscle and the culture.

## What's Next

You've defined ownership. But ownership is only useful if the owners are still around to do the work. And in any organization, people leave. Knowledge walks out the door.

In the next subchapter, we're tackling documentation that survives team turnover. How do you ensure that the person who defined your ground truth can leave without taking all that knowledge with them? How do you onboard new people into ground truth frameworks? How do you build institutional memory that lasts?

Ground truth is a living system that needs to survive beyond any individual person. Let's talk about how to make that happen.
