# Chapter 1 — What Ground Truth Actually Is

Most AI teams jump straight to building — choosing models, writing prompts, collecting data. They skip the one question that determines whether any of that work matters: **what does "good" actually mean?**

Ground truth is your answer to that question. It's the explicit, documented definition of what correct, safe, and useful looks like for your specific product. Without it, everything downstream — your labels, metrics, evaluations, and production monitoring — is built on sand.

This chapter takes you from the most common mistake teams make, through the different types of truth people constantly confuse, to the practices that separate elite teams from everyone else.
