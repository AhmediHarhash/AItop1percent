# Ground Truth & What Good Looks Like

Before you can evaluate anything, you need to answer one question: **what does "good" actually mean for your product?**

That question sounds simple. It isn't. Most AI teams skip it — and spend months arguing about quality, shipping regressions, and rebuilding systems that were never properly defined in the first place.

Ground truth is the foundation everything else in this book builds on. Your datasets, labels, metrics, evaluations, and production monitoring all depend on having a clear, shared, documented definition of what correct, safe, and useful looks like for your specific product.

This section walks you through defining that foundation — from scratch, across risk tiers, for every AI modality, with stakeholder alignment, and with the governance to maintain it as your product evolves.

## Why This Section Matters

Without ground truth, you're guessing. Your metrics measure nothing meaningful. Your evaluators disagree on what "good" means. Your production monitoring alerts on the wrong things. Your team argues endlessly because everyone has a different implicit standard.

With ground truth, everything clicks. Labels become consistent. Metrics become actionable. Evaluations become repeatable. Teams align. Products improve.

This is where serious AI engineering begins.

*Let's start with the question every AI team gets wrong.*
