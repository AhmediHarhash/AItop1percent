# Chapter 3 — Defining Allowed & Forbidden Behavior

Knowing what "good" means isn't enough. You need to draw hard lines — what your system must always do, what it must never do, and how much room it gets in between.

Most teams skip this step and pay for it later. Without explicit behavior boundaries, every edge case becomes a debate, every incident becomes a surprise, and every reviewer applies their own invisible standard. The result is inconsistent quality that erodes trust with users and regulators alike.

This chapter gives you the Behavior Boundary Framework — a systematic way to define required behaviors, hard boundaries, ambiguity budgets, refusal rules, confidence thresholds, and the edge cases that break simple rules. By the end, you'll have a behavior specification your entire team can follow.
