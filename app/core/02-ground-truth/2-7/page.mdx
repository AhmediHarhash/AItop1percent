# 2.7 — When Tasks Span Multiple Tiers

Picture this user conversation with a banking AI:

**User:** "Tell me about high-yield savings accounts."
**AI:** "High-yield savings accounts currently offer around 4-5% annual interest, significantly higher than traditional savings accounts at 0.5%. They're FDIC insured and provide easy access to your money." (Tier 2 — advisory)

**User:** "Which one should I get?"
**AI:** "Based on your account history, you might consider Marcus by Goldman Sachs (4.5% APY, no minimum), Ally Bank (4.35% APY, no fees), or American Express Personal Savings (4.3% APY)." (Tier 2 — recommendations)

**User:** "Open one with Marcus for me."
**AI:** "I can help you start that process. Opening a savings account requires..." (Tier 1 or 0 — about to take action)

In the span of three exchanges, this conversation moved from general education (Tier 2) to specific recommendations (still Tier 2) to executing a financial account opening (Tier 0). The AI must recognize this tier transition and shift its behavior accordingly — from casual helpfulness to rigorous verification.

This is one of the hardest challenges in building real AI products: conversations don't stay in one tier. Users naturally transition from exploration to decision to action, and your AI must detect these transitions and adapt its standards mid-conversation without confusing the user.

## Why Tier Transitions Are Hard

In a perfect world, each conversation would stay in one tier. Users would have separate "exploration sessions" and "transaction sessions." The AI could apply consistent standards throughout.

Reality is messier. Users don't think in terms of tiers. They have a goal — maybe "improve my savings" — and they follow that goal through whatever tier boundaries exist. The conversation naturally flows from learning to deciding to acting.

This creates several challenges:

**Detection challenge:** The AI must recognize when the user is shifting from one tier to another. "Tell me about X" is different from "Do X for me," but the boundary isn't always clean.

**Context preservation challenge:** Information gathered in the Tier 2 advisory phase needs to be carried forward to the Tier 1 transactional phase. The user shouldn't have to repeat themselves.

**Standard shifting challenge:** The AI's ground truth standards must shift mid-conversation. Approximate helpfulness becomes insufficient when actual actions are about to be taken.

**UX continuity challenge:** The tier shift should feel natural to the user, not like they've suddenly entered a different product. The increased rigor shouldn't feel like friction or distrust.

**Safety challenge:** The system must ensure that looser Tier 2/3 standards from the earlier conversation don't compromise Tier 0/1 actions later. Past exploration doesn't guarantee current action safety.

Let me walk you through how to handle each of these challenges.

## Detecting Tier Transitions

The first challenge is recognizing when the user is moving from one tier to another. Some transitions are explicit, others are subtle.

**Explicit tier escalation signals:**

These are clear requests to move from advisory to action:

- "Do it" / "Go ahead" / "Yes, proceed"
- "Book that flight"
- "Buy 100 shares"
- "Delete my account"
- "Send the email"
- "Subscribe me to Pro plan"

When the user gives a clear action command, the tier shifts immediately. The AI must recognize this and switch to the appropriate tier's standards.

**Implicit tier escalation signals:**

These are more subtle but indicate the user is moving toward action:

- "When can I start?" (implies willingness to proceed)
- "What do I need to do?" (moving from learning to acting)
- "How much would that cost?" (evaluating feasibility of action)
- Providing specific details unprompted (sharing account numbers, addresses, payment info suggests readiness to act)

These don't immediately trigger a tier escalation, but they should put the AI into a "preparing for potential tier escalation" mode.

**Ambiguous statements that require clarification:**

Some user inputs could be either advisory or actionable:

User: "Put $5,000 into that high-yield account."

Is this:
- A request to execute a transfer (Tier 0/1)
- A hypothetical to explore ("What if I put $5,000...")
- A future intention ("I'm planning to put...")

The AI needs to disambiguate before proceeding:

AI: "Just to confirm: would you like me to transfer $5,000 from your checking account to open a Marcus savings account now, or are you still exploring your options?"

This clarification serves two purposes: it confirms the user's intent, and it explicitly signals the tier shift to the user.

**Context-based tier detection:**

Sometimes tier is determined by context, not just the current utterance:

If the user has been discussing options for 10 minutes and suddenly provides specific details (an address, a date, a quantity), that's likely a tier escalation.

If the user has been in a transactional tier and then asks "Why?" or "Tell me more about that," they might be de-escalating back to advisory.

The AI should track conversation flow and recognize these context-based transitions.

## The Tier Escalation Trigger Pattern

When the AI detects a potential tier escalation from advisory to transactional, it should follow a consistent pattern:

**1. Confirm intent:**
Verify that the user actually wants to take action, not just explore.

"To confirm: you'd like me to book this flight now, or are you still comparing options?"

**2. Surface gathered information:**
Show what information was collected during the advisory phase and will be used for the action.

"Based on our conversation, I'll book:
- Flight: United 1234, NYC to SF
- Date: March 15, 2026
- Passenger: John Smith
- Seat preference: Window"

**3. Request any missing critical information:**
If the action requires information that wasn't needed in the advisory phase, request it now.

"To complete the booking, I'll need:
- Passport number
- Frequent flyer number (optional)"

**4. State the tier explicitly (in user-friendly terms):**
Make it clear that you're now moving to action, not just discussion.

"Once you confirm, I'll proceed with the booking. The charge of $450 will be applied to your card ending in 1234."

**5. Apply higher-tier confirmation:**
Use the confirmation pattern appropriate for the destination tier (Tier 1 detailed confirmation or Tier 0 verification protocol).

**6. Execute only after explicit confirmation:**
Don't proceed until the user explicitly confirms with the increased context.

This pattern bridges the tier transition smoothly while ensuring safety.

## Context Preservation Across Tiers

One of the user experience challenges in tier transitions is context preservation. Users don't want to repeat information.

Bad experience:

User: "I want to visit Tokyo for a week in March, staying in Shibuya, interested in tech and food."
AI: [Provides recommendations — Tier 2]
User: "Book the hotel you suggested."
AI: "Sure! What dates? How many guests? What neighborhood?"
User: 😠 "I just told you all that!"

The AI lost context when transitioning tiers. This is frustrating and feels like talking to a different system.

Good experience:

User: "I want to visit Tokyo for a week in March, staying in Shibuya, interested in tech and food."
AI: [Provides recommendations — Tier 2]
User: "Book the hotel you suggested."
AI: "I'll book the Shibuya Excel Hotel for March 15-22, 2026, for 1 guest. Is that correct?"

The AI preserved context from the advisory conversation and carried it forward to the booking action.

**Implementation approach:**

Maintain conversation state that includes:
- User preferences and requirements stated in advisory tier
- Options discussed and selected
- Constraints and priorities
- Any decisions or selections made

When transitioning to a higher tier, surface this state for confirmation rather than asking the user to repeat it.

**Validation layer:**

Even though you're preserving context, you must validate it before acting. Information gathered casually in Tier 2 needs stricter verification in Tier 0/1.

Tier 2: "So you're looking for hotels under $200/night, got it."
Tier 1 (at booking): "I'll book a room at $189/night. The total for 7 nights will be $1,323. Please confirm."

The price was mentioned in Tier 2, but the total commitment is made explicit in Tier 1.

## The Dynamic Standards Problem

Here's a subtle but critical challenge: the AI's underlying model might need to operate at different quality levels mid-conversation.

In Tier 2, approximate understanding is acceptable. If the user says "I want a hotel in Tokyo" and the AI interprets that as "looking for Tokyo accommodations," that's fine.

In Tier 0, approximate understanding is not acceptable. If the user says "Transfer to my savings account" and the AI interprets that as "might want to transfer to savings," that's dangerous.

This means your ground truth dataset needs to cover tier transitions explicitly.

**Ground truth for tier transitions should include:**

**Tier escalation examples:**

Conversations that start in one tier and move to another. Annotators label:
- When the tier transition occurs
- Whether the AI correctly detected it
- Whether appropriate confirmation was requested
- Whether context was correctly preserved
- Whether the higher tier's standards were applied

**Ambiguity resolution examples:**

Statements that could be multiple tiers depending on interpretation. Annotators label:
- What clarifying question the AI should ask
- What information would resolve the ambiguity
- What the correct tier assignment is for each interpretation

**Context validation examples:**

Information gathered in lower tiers being used in higher tiers. Annotators verify:
- Is the information correctly preserved?
- Is it appropriately re-confirmed before use?
- Are any gaps or uncertainties made explicit?

**Failed escalation examples:**

Cases where the AI should escalate tiers but doesn't, or escalates incorrectly. These negative examples are crucial for learning.

## Real Example: Investment Advisory to Execution

Let me walk through a detailed example of tier transition handling in a real product — an investment platform AI.

**The conversation:**

User: "I want to start investing in index funds." (Tier 2 — learning/advisory)

AI: "Index funds are a great way to build diversified exposure to the market. They track indexes like the S&P 500, offering broad market returns with low fees. Are you interested in stock index funds, bond index funds, or both?"

User: "Stock index funds, focused on S&P 500." (Still Tier 2)

AI: "For S&P 500 index funds, here are three excellent options:

1. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) — 0.03% expense ratio
2. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) — 0.09% expense ratio
3. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) — 0.03% expense ratio

All three track the same index. VOO and IVV have lower fees. What's your investment timeframe and how much are you thinking of investing?"

User: "Long-term, probably $10,000 to start." (Still Tier 2, gathering info)

AI: "For a long-term investment, all three would work well. VOO tends to be the most popular choice among long-term investors due to its low fees and liquidity. You could invest the full $10,000 at once (lump sum) or spread it out over several months (dollar-cost averaging). Each approach has tradeoffs depending on market conditions and your risk comfort."

User: "Let's go with VOO, lump sum." (Escalation trigger — decision made)

AI: "Great choice. Before we proceed, let me confirm what I understand:

You want to invest $10,000 in VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) as a lump sum purchase.

This is a long-term investment in your taxable brokerage account.

**Important**: This will be a market order executed at the current market price. Based on current prices, this would purchase approximately 42 shares at around $238/share. The exact price and share quantity will depend on the market price when the order executes.

Is this correct, or would you like to adjust anything?" (Tier 1 — confirming before action, being specific about execution details)

User: "Yes, that's right."

AI: "Just to be completely clear about what will happen:

**Action**: Market order to buy VOO
**Amount**: $10,000
**Account**: Your taxable brokerage account (ending in 5678)
**Approximate shares**: 42 (exact amount depends on execution price)
**Timing**: Order will be placed immediately when market is open
**Settlement**: 2 business days

This will reduce your cash balance by approximately $10,000.

**This is a real trade that cannot be undone once executed.** Are you ready to proceed?" (Tier 0 — about to execute irreversible financial transaction)

User: "Yes, proceed."

AI: [Executes trade, provides confirmation]

"Trade executed:
- Bought 42 shares of VOO
- Execution price: $237.89 per share
- Total cost: $9,991.38
- Confirmation number: #ABC123
- Settlement date: March 17, 2026

Your trade has been completed. You can view it in your account activity."

**What happened in this transition:**

**Tier 2 → Tier 2:** From general education about index funds to specific recommendations about which funds. Still advisory, multiple exchanges, casual conversation flow.

**Tier 2 → Tier 1:** When user said "Let's go with VOO, lump sum," the AI detected a decision/action intent. It confirmed understanding and surfaced all the details gathered during the advisory conversation. It made clear this would be a real action.

**Tier 1 → Tier 0:** When user confirmed, the AI escalated further to Tier 0 (irreversible trade execution). It provided complete details, stated the irreversibility explicitly, and required final confirmation before executing.

**Ground truth for this conversation:**

Annotators (certified financial professionals) evaluate:

1. **Tier detection accuracy:**
   - Did the AI correctly identify "Let's go with VOO" as an escalation trigger? (Yes)
   - Did it correctly escalate from advisory to transactional? (Yes)

2. **Context preservation:**
   - Did the AI correctly remember the $10,000 amount? (Yes)
   - Did it correctly remember VOO selection? (Yes)
   - Did it correctly remember lump-sum preference? (Yes)

3. **Appropriate confirmation:**
   - At Tier 1, did it confirm understanding with specific details? (Yes)
   - At Tier 0, did it make the irreversibility and exact action explicit? (Yes)

4. **Missing information handling:**
   - Did the AI identify that order type (market vs limit) wasn't specified and choose an appropriate default? (Yes, market order is standard)
   - Did it explain the implications (price variability)? (Yes)

5. **Safety standards:**
   - Did the conversation shift from helpful approximation to exact specifications? (Yes)
   - Was the user given adequate information to understand what would happen? (Yes)

This conversation would be labeled as high-quality tier transition handling.

## The Tier De-escalation Pattern

Transitions don't only go upward. Users sometimes move from transactional back to advisory.

User in Tier 1 (about to book a flight): "Wait, actually, why is this flight cheaper than the others you showed me?"

This is a de-escalation trigger. The user is moving from action back to exploration. The AI should:

**1. Pause the action flow:**
"No problem, I've paused the booking process. Let me explain the pricing..."

**2. Switch to advisory mode:**
Provide explanation, comparison, context — Tier 2 helpfulness standards.

**3. Keep the action context available:**
After explaining, offer to resume: "Does that make sense? Would you still like to book this flight, or would you prefer to look at other options?"

**4. Re-confirm if returning to action:**
If the user decides to proceed after de-escalation, go through the confirmation pattern again. Don't assume prior confirmation still applies after exploration.

## Handling Uncertainty During Tier Transitions

Sometimes the AI isn't certain what tier a user statement falls into. The right response is to clarify:

User: "Add $1,000 to my investment account."

Ambiguous: Does "add" mean "transfer from checking" (Tier 1 action) or "I'm planning to add" (Tier 2 planning)?

AI: "Just to clarify: Would you like me to transfer $1,000 from your checking account into your investment account now, or are you planning to do that yourself and want to discuss how to invest it?"

This clarification prevents mis-tiering. Better to ask one clarifying question than to execute in the wrong tier.

## The Multi-Tier Session State

For products that regularly handle tier transitions, maintain explicit session state:

**Current tier:** What tier is the current conversation operating in?

**Tier history:** What tiers has this session moved through? (Useful for understanding conversation flow)

**Pending action:** If tier has escalated to transactional, what action is pending confirmation?

**Gathered information:** What details were collected that might be used in higher tiers?

**Escalation flags:** Any indicators that tier might change soon?

This state helps the AI make better tier transition decisions and provides context for quality evaluation.

## When Tier Boundaries Are Product Design Choices

Sometimes you can design your product to make tier boundaries clearer and transitions more explicit.

**Separate flows for separate tiers:**

Instead of allowing seamless tier transitions within one conversation, you could design distinct flows:
- Advisory/exploration flow: Conversational, flexible, Tier 2/3
- Transaction flow: Structured forms, explicit steps, Tier 0/1

When user wants to transition from advisory to transaction, they explicitly "start a booking" or "begin checkout" — a clear UX boundary that signals the tier shift.

**Progressive disclosure of rigor:**

Start with casual conversation. As the user moves toward action, the UX becomes progressively more structured and explicit:
- Tier 3: Free-form chat
- Tier 2: Chat with structured suggestions
- Tier 1: Structured summary + confirmation
- Tier 0: Detailed form-like confirmation + explicit warnings

The increasing structure signals the increasing stakes.

**Explicit tier labeling:**

Some products explicitly tell users when they're entering higher-tier territory:

"You're about to make a financial transaction. I'll need to collect some specific information and confirm the details before proceeding."

This sets expectations and makes the tier transition an explicit, understood boundary.

## Ground Truth for Tier Transition Conversations

Your ground truth dataset should include substantial tier-transition examples, not just single-tier conversations.

**Minimum representation:**

At least 20-30% of your ground truth should be multi-tier conversations that include transitions. This ensures the AI learns to handle tier shifting, not just static tier operations.

**Transition types to cover:**

- Tier 2 → Tier 1 (advisory to transactional)
- Tier 3 → Tier 2 (exploratory to advisory)
- Tier 1 → Tier 0 (low-stakes transactional to critical action)
- Tier 1 → Tier 2 (de-escalation from action to advisory)
- Tier 0 abort (user starts critical action but changes mind)

**Annotation focus:**

For tier transition examples, annotators should evaluate:
- Correct tier detection (did the AI recognize the transition?)
- Appropriate response shift (did behavior change to match the new tier?)
- Context preservation (was information carried forward correctly?)
- User clarity (would the user understand the tier shift?)
- Safety (did higher-tier standards apply when needed?)

## Real Example: Healthcare Triage System

Another detailed tier transition example: a healthcare symptom checker that moves from general inquiry to urgent triage.

**Conversation:**

User: "I've had a headache for a few days." (Tier 2 — general symptom inquiry)

AI: "Headaches can have many causes. Can you tell me more? Is it constant or comes and goes? Where is the pain located? Any other symptoms?"

User: "It's constant, on the right side of my head. Pretty bad pain." (Still Tier 2)

AI: "A constant one-sided headache could be a migraine, tension headache, or other causes. Have you had migraines before? Are you experiencing any nausea, vision changes, or sensitivity to light?"

User: "No migraines before. Actually, now that you mention it, my vision is a bit blurry on the right side." (Escalation trigger — combination of symptoms changes urgency)

AI: "I want to be cautious here. A sudden severe headache with vision changes, especially if you've never had migraines before, can sometimes indicate conditions that need immediate medical attention.

**This is important**: I'm not diagnosing you, but this combination of symptoms warrants prompt evaluation to rule out serious causes.

Can you tell me: Is this the worst headache you've ever had? Any neck stiffness? Any confusion or difficulty speaking?" (Tier 1 — triage mode, gathering critical information)

User: "It's very bad, yes. No neck stiffness. Maybe a little trouble finding words?"

AI: "Thank you for that information. Based on what you're describing — sudden severe headache, vision changes, and some word-finding difficulty — **you should seek emergency medical evaluation today.**

This could be something minor, but these symptoms can also indicate conditions like stroke or other neurological issues that require immediate assessment.

**Recommended action**: Go to the emergency department or call 911 if symptoms worsen.

This is not a diagnosis, but these symptoms should not wait for a regular appointment.

Do you need help locating the nearest emergency department?" (Tier 0 — urgent recommendation with potential life-safety implications)

**What happened:**

**Tier 2 → Tier 2:** General symptom exploration, multiple possible causes, casual Q&A about headache characteristics.

**Tier 2 → Tier 1:** When vision changes were mentioned, the AI detected potential escalation. It shifted to more focused triage questioning, stated it was being cautious, asked targeted questions about serious symptom indicators.

**Tier 1 → Tier 0:** When the symptom constellation (severe headache + vision changes + word-finding difficulty + no prior migraines) met criteria for urgent evaluation, the AI escalated to clear, directive recommendation for emergency care.

**Ground truth annotation:**

Medical professional annotators evaluate:

1. **Escalation detection:**
   - Did the AI correctly identify vision changes as an escalation trigger? (Yes)
   - Did it correctly recognize the symptom combination as urgent? (Yes)

2. **Response appropriateness:**
   - At Tier 2, was the general exploration appropriate? (Yes)
   - At Tier 1, did it shift to focused triage? (Yes)
   - At Tier 0, did it provide clear, urgent guidance? (Yes)

3. **Safety margin:**
   - Did the AI err on the side of caution? (Yes)
   - Were disclaimers appropriate? (Yes — "not diagnosing," "to rule out")
   - Was urgency communicated clearly? (Yes — "today," "immediate")

4. **Context preservation:**
   - Did the AI consider the full symptom picture, not just the latest statement? (Yes)
   - Did it integrate multiple symptoms into triage decision? (Yes)

This would be labeled as high-quality tier transition with appropriate urgency escalation.

## If You Skip This, Here's What Happens

Teams that don't design for tier transitions face:

**Safety failures:** Advisory-tier loose standards bleed into transactional-tier actions, causing errors in critical tasks.

**User confusion:** Sudden shifts in AI behavior without clear signals feel jarring and inconsistent.

**Context loss:** Users get frustrated repeating information when moving from exploration to action.

**Missed escalations:** The AI fails to detect when stakes have risen and maintains inappropriate casualness for high-risk actions.

**False escalations:** The AI over-escalates, treating exploratory questions as action requests, frustrating users.

**Inconsistent quality:** Ground truth that only covers single-tier interactions doesn't prepare the AI for real multi-tier conversations.

The solution: explicit tier transition patterns, detection logic, context preservation, appropriate confirmation at each tier, and ground truth datasets that include substantial multi-tier conversations.

Next, we'll examine how the regulatory landscape of 2026 maps to these risk tiers and what documentation each tier requires for compliance.
