# 30.1.1 — The Company That Priced Like SaaS and Bled $4.2 Million in Margin

In January 2025, a B2B AI company with seventy-three employees and $14 million in annual recurring revenue held a board meeting that nobody expected to be an emergency. The company sold an AI-powered document analysis tool to law firms, insurance adjusters, and corporate legal departments. The product worked beautifully — it ingested contracts, extracted key clauses, flagged risk language, and generated summary reports that saved attorneys hours of manual review. Customer satisfaction scores were above ninety percent. Net Promoter Score was sixty-two. The sales pipeline was growing at thirty percent quarter over quarter. By every product metric, the company was winning.

The CFO opened her slide with one number: negative $4.2 million. That was the cumulative gross margin loss from the company's top fifteen accounts over the previous eighteen months. Not revenue loss. Not runway burn. Gross margin loss — the gap between what those fifteen customers paid and what it cost to serve them. The company was paying its best customers to use the product, and it had taken eighteen months to figure it out.

## The Pricing Decision That Seemed Obvious

The company had launched with a pricing model that felt intuitive. They charged $200 per user per month, with volume discounts for larger deployments. The model was clean, predictable, and easy for sales to communicate. Enterprise buyers understood per-seat pricing because they had been buying software that way for twenty years. A fifty-lawyer deployment meant $10,000 per month. A two-hundred-lawyer deployment meant $40,000 per month with a fifteen percent volume discount. Procurement teams could model the cost. Finance could forecast the expense. The pricing felt right because it matched every other tool in the buyer's stack.

The problem was that every other tool in the buyer's stack had near-zero marginal cost per user. Salesforce does not spend meaningfully more money when your two-hundredth user logs in. Slack does not burn compute when your thousandth team member sends a message. The infrastructure cost of serving an additional seat on traditional SaaS is measured in fractions of a penny. That assumption — that the cost of serving user number two hundred is essentially the same as the cost of serving user number one — is the foundation that makes per-seat pricing work in traditional software. It means your gross margin improves as you scale. Every new seat is almost pure revenue.

AI demolished that assumption for this company, and they did not realize it for a year and a half.

## The Cost-to-Serve Discovery

The document analysis tool worked by sending contracts through a pipeline. First, optical character recognition extracted text from scanned documents. Then a large language model analyzed the extracted text against a library of risk patterns, clause templates, and regulatory requirements. Finally, the model generated structured outputs — clause-by-clause summaries, risk scores, comparison reports against baseline templates. Each document required between three thousand and forty-five thousand tokens of model input depending on length, and each analysis generated between two thousand and eight thousand tokens of output. The cost per document analysis ranged from $0.04 for a short amendment to $1.80 for a complex multi-party agreement running over a hundred pages.

The company knew this in the abstract. What they had never done was map those per-document costs to individual customer accounts. When the finance team finally ran that analysis in late 2024, the results were staggering. The average cost-to-serve across all customers was $47 per user per month. At $200 per user, that left $153 in gross margin per seat — a healthy seventy-six percent. The aggregate number looked fine.

But averages lie when variance is high. The cheapest ten percent of customers — firms that used the tool lightly, running ten to fifteen analyses per user per month — cost $8 per user to serve. Their gross margin was ninety-six percent, indistinguishable from traditional SaaS. The most expensive ten percent of customers — large firms that had built the tool into their daily workflow, running eighty to two hundred analyses per user per month with long, complex documents — cost $340 per user to serve. At $200 per user per month, the company was losing $140 for every seat at those accounts. And those accounts had the most seats.

## The Heavy User Problem

The company's top fifteen accounts represented thirty-eight percent of total revenue. They were the biggest logos, the best case studies, the accounts that the sales team referenced on every call. They were also the accounts destroying margin. Collectively, those fifteen accounts generated $5.3 million in annual revenue and cost $9.5 million to serve, producing a gross margin of negative seventy-nine percent. The company was subsidizing its largest customers with revenue from its smallest ones.

This is the **Heavy User Problem**, and it is endemic to AI products priced with flat per-seat models. In traditional SaaS, heavy users and light users cost roughly the same to serve, so variance in usage patterns is irrelevant to margin. In AI, a power user who runs two hundred document analyses per day generates fifty to a hundred times the compute cost of a user who runs three. When both pay the same $200 per month, the power user is getting subsidized by every light user on the platform.

The pattern is worse than it first appears, because the customers who use your product the most are also the customers most likely to expand, most likely to renew, and most likely to become references. The company's sales team was actively pursuing more accounts that looked like their top fifteen — large firms with heavy usage patterns — because those accounts had the highest contract values and the fastest expansion rates. Every deal the sales team closed in that segment accelerated the margin bleed.

## Why Nobody Caught It for Eighteen Months

Three organizational failures conspired to hide the problem. The first was an accounting structure that treated infrastructure costs as a single line item. The company's cloud and API bills were allocated to a general infrastructure budget, not attributed to individual customers. The finance team saw total infrastructure spending climb from $180,000 per month to $620,000 per month over the period, but attributed the growth to overall customer base expansion rather than concentration in high-usage accounts. The per-customer cost-to-serve analysis that would have exposed the problem was never built because nobody thought to ask the question.

The second failure was a sales compensation model that rewarded revenue without reference to margin. Account executives earned commission on annual contract value. A $480,000 deal with a two-hundred-lawyer firm paid the same commission rate as a $48,000 deal with a twenty-lawyer boutique, even though the large deal was margin-negative and the small deal was margin-positive. The sales team had no incentive to consider cost-to-serve because they had no visibility into it and no compensation link to it.

The third failure was the most subtle and the most common. The company's leadership had internalized SaaS mental models so deeply that they never questioned whether those models applied. The CEO had spent a decade in traditional SaaS. The VP of Sales came from Salesforce. The head of product had built features at a project management tool. Every instinct, every heuristic, every benchmark they carried came from a world where marginal cost per user was essentially zero. When infrastructure costs rose, they assumed it was a scaling challenge that would improve with volume — because in SaaS, unit economics always improve with volume. In AI, unit economics can deteriorate with volume if your heaviest users grow fastest.

## The Eighteen-Month Margin Waterfall

The CFO reconstructed the timeline in detail for the board. In the first six months after launch, the company had mostly small and mid-size accounts. Average cost-to-serve was $22 per user. Gross margin was eighty-nine percent. The numbers looked like SaaS because the customer base looked like SaaS — moderate, predictable usage.

In months seven through twelve, the sales team closed four enterprise accounts with more than a hundred seats each. Usage patterns at those accounts ramped quickly as firms integrated the tool into their standard workflows. Average cost-to-serve across the full base climbed to $47 per user, but the enterprise accounts individually ran at $180 to $260 per user. Gross margin dropped to seventy-six percent in aggregate, but the enterprise cohort was already margin-negative.

In months thirteen through eighteen, three of those enterprise accounts expanded significantly. One went from a hundred twenty seats to three hundred ten. Another built custom workflows that increased per-user analysis volumes by four times. A third integrated the tool with their document management system, automating analysis on every new document ingested — turning their users from occasional analysts into continuous processing pipelines. The top fifteen accounts collectively generated $340 in average cost per user per month against the $200 they paid, and the gap was widening every quarter.

The total damage was $4.2 million in negative gross margin from those accounts. The company's overall gross margin had fallen from eighty-nine percent to fifty-one percent in eighteen months. They were still growing revenue. They were still growing customers. They were heading toward a wall.

## The Fix That Took Six Months and Cost Two Enterprise Accounts

The company spent the next six months restructuring its pricing. They moved to a hybrid model: a base platform fee of $120 per user per month that covered a defined usage allocation — thirty document analyses per user per month — plus a consumption charge of $0.85 per additional analysis. The platform fee provided revenue predictability. The consumption charge aligned cost-to-serve with revenue for heavy users.

The transition was painful. Two of the top fifteen accounts refused to accept the new pricing structure and churned to a competitor that still offered flat per-seat pricing. The company lost $960,000 in annual revenue from those two accounts. What the sales team did not mention in the loss post-mortem was that those two accounts had been costing the company $1.4 million per year to serve — the churn actually improved margins by $440,000 annually.

The remaining enterprise accounts negotiated hard but ultimately accepted the hybrid structure, largely because the company invested in usage dashboards that showed clients exactly what they were consuming and where the value was concentrated. Eleven months after the pricing change, the company's blended gross margin had recovered to sixty-eight percent, and the top accounts were individually margin-positive for the first time.

## The Lesson Before the Framework

This company's story is not unusual. It is the default outcome for AI products that price like traditional software without accounting for the variable cost structure that AI introduces. The specific numbers vary — the margin bleed might be $400,000 or $40 million depending on scale — but the pattern is identical. Flat pricing meets variable costs. Heavy users subsidized by light users. Margin erosion hidden by revenue growth. A crisis that arrives eighteen to twenty-four months after launch, exactly when the company's best customers have ramped their usage to the point where every expansion makes the problem worse.

The deeper lesson is that AI pricing is not a variation of SaaS pricing. It is a different discipline with different economics, different risks, and different mechanics. The assumptions that made SaaS pricing simple — near-zero marginal cost, linear scaling economics, usage-agnostic unit economics — do not hold when every query burns compute, every customer has a different cost-to-serve, and your underlying model provider can restructure your cost basis with thirty days notice.

The cost structure that caused this company's crisis is not a bug in their business. It is a fundamental property of AI products, and understanding it is the prerequisite for every pricing decision that follows in this section.
