# Chapter 2 — The AI Margin Stack: From Token Cost to Gross Profit

Your gross margin is the single number that determines whether your AI product is a business or a charity. In traditional SaaS, gross margins of 78 to 85 percent were standard because infrastructure cost was a rounding error next to revenue. AI-first products routinely launch at 50 to 60 percent gross margins — and many teams do not even know their real number because they have never traced the full cost of serving a single query from token inference through infrastructure, retrieval, evaluation, human review, and support. This chapter teaches the Margin Stack — every cost layer from the model provider API call to the customer success ticket — and the engineering discipline that systematically moves your margins from launch-stage thin to investor-grade healthy.

*You cannot price what you cannot measure. Before choosing a pricing model, you need to know — down to the penny — what it costs you to serve each customer.*
