# 30.8.8 — The Pricing Governance Model: Who Can Discount and How Much

The sales rep is on the phone with a prospect who controls a 200-seat deployment at a Fortune 500 financial services firm. The deal is worth $380,000 annually. The prospect says they have a competing offer at thirty percent less. The rep asks her manager for a twenty-five percent discount. The manager, two days from quarter close and $600,000 short of target, approves it in eleven minutes without checking the cost-to-serve data. The deal closes at $285,000. The team celebrates. Nobody calculates that at the approved discount, the customer's usage pattern makes the deal margin-negative by $47,000 per year. Nobody records the discount rationale. Nobody reviews whether the competing offer was real or a negotiation tactic. And six months later, the same customer's procurement team shares the discounted rate with two other prospects in the same industry — who now refuse to pay list price.

This is not a story about a bad sales rep or a weak manager. It is a story about what happens in every organization that has pricing but no **Pricing Governance Model** — no formal system that defines who can discount, by how much, under what conditions, with what justification, and subject to what review. Without governance, every sales conversation becomes a one-off negotiation where the rep's incentive to close the deal outweighs the company's interest in margin protection. The cumulative damage is not one bad deal. It is a systematic erosion of pricing power that compounds quarter after quarter until your effective average selling price is twenty to forty percent below the list price you thought you were charging.

## The Anatomy of Discount Chaos

The pattern is predictable. In the first year of a company's life, pricing decisions are made by the founder or a small team. Discounts are rare, deliberate, and discussed. Everyone knows the margin implications because everyone is involved in every deal. Governance is informal but effective because the decision-making surface is small.

In the second year, the sales team grows from three people to ten. The founder is no longer on every deal call. Reps start offering discounts to close deals faster, initially small — five percent here, ten percent there. There is no formal approval process because the company has not yet experienced the pain of discount abuse. Each individual discount seems reasonable.

By the third year, the company has forty reps and a sales management layer. Average discounts have crept from five percent to eighteen percent. Some strategic deals have been closed at thirty-five to forty-five percent below list price. A handful of "logo acquisition" deals were sold at cost or below cost. The reps who discount most aggressively often have the highest revenue numbers, because of course they do — it is easier to sell at a lower price. These reps get promoted. Their behavior becomes the norm. New reps learn that discounting is how you close deals at this company.

Meanwhile, the finance team notices that revenue per customer has declined despite list prices remaining unchanged. Gross margin has dropped by eight percentage points. Customer acquisition cost metrics look healthy because they are calculated against contract value, not margin-adjusted contract value. The company is growing topline while the foundation underneath it hollows out. This is the **Discount Death Spiral**, and by the time the executive team recognizes it, the organizational muscle memory of deep discounting has become the default behavior that is extraordinarily difficult to reverse.

## Discount Authority Tiers

The Pricing Governance Model starts with a clear definition of who can approve what level of discount. This is not a suggestion. It is a hard rule enforced through your CPQ system, your deal desk, or whatever mechanism your organization uses to process quotes. If a quote can be generated without the appropriate approval, the governance model does not exist regardless of what your policy document says.

**Tier One: Rep-Level Authority.** Individual sales reps should have the ability to offer small discounts without seeking approval, because requiring approval for every minor concession slows down the sales process and frustrates both the rep and the buyer. The typical range for rep-level authority is five to ten percent off list price. The exact threshold depends on your margin structure — if your gross margins are seventy percent, ten percent discount authority leaves plenty of room. If your gross margins are fifty percent, ten percent discount authority on a high-usage customer could push the deal below breakeven. Set the rep-level threshold at a point where even the worst-case cost-to-serve scenario still produces a positive margin.

**Tier Two: Manager-Level Authority.** Sales managers or regional directors can approve discounts up to fifteen to twenty percent off list price. At this level, the manager must verify two things before approving: that the cost-to-serve estimate for the customer still yields a positive margin at the discounted price, and that the rep has documented the competitive or strategic justification for the discount. "The customer asked for a discount" is not a justification. "The customer has a competing proposal from a named competitor at a specific price point, and our win-loss analysis suggests we need to be within fifteen percent of that price to remain competitive" is a justification.

**Tier Three: VP or Deal Desk Authority.** Discounts above twenty percent require approval from a VP of Sales, a dedicated deal desk, or a pricing committee. At this level, the approval requires a written business case that includes the expected cost-to-serve for the account, the projected margin at the discounted price, the strategic rationale for the discount, and the expected payback period if the deal is being framed as a land-and-expand investment. The deal desk should also verify that the proposed price does not create a dangerous reference point — if this customer is in the same segment as your highest-paying customers, a deep discount creates a benchmark that those customers will eventually discover and use against you.

**Tier Four: Executive Override.** Discounts above thirty to thirty-five percent, or any deal that will be margin-negative, require explicit approval from the CFO, CEO, or a pricing committee that includes finance representation. These deals should be rare — perhaps three to five per quarter. Each one should be treated as an investment with a documented thesis: "We are investing $47,000 in margin loss over the first year because this logo will generate $200,000 in reference value, the account is expected to expand to three times its initial usage within eighteen months, and the cost-to-serve will decline as we optimize model routing for their use case." If the thesis cannot be articulated clearly, the discount should not be approved.

## The Floor Price: The Line That Never Moves

Every product should have a **floor price** — the absolute minimum price at which a deal can close, regardless of strategic justification, competitive pressure, or executive enthusiasm. The floor price is calculated from the cost-to-serve at the expected usage level plus a minimum margin that covers the operational cost of supporting the account — customer success time, technical support, billing overhead, compliance costs.

The floor price is not the same as the breakeven price. It includes a margin buffer above breakeven because a deal that is margin-neutral is not "free" — it consumes sales capacity, support capacity, and management attention that could have been directed at a margin-positive deal. A common approach is to set the floor price at the point that guarantees at least a fifteen to twenty percent gross margin under the customer's expected usage pattern.

The enforcement mechanism matters more than the number itself. If a deal desk can override the floor price with a VP signature, the floor is not a floor — it is a suggestion. The companies that maintain pricing discipline treat the floor as an absolute constraint. A deal that cannot close above the floor does not close. This is painful in the moment — walking away from a Fortune 500 logo hurts — but it prevents the cascading damage that below-floor deals create when other customers discover the pricing.

One important nuance: the floor price must be customer-specific, not product-specific, because cost-to-serve varies by customer. A customer with moderate usage patterns might have a floor price of $180 per user per month. A customer in the same segment with heavy usage patterns might have a floor price of $260 per user per month. If you set a single product-level floor of $180, the heavy-usage customer gets a price that does not cover their cost to serve. Your billing and deal desk systems need to calculate per-customer floors based on estimated usage, not just apply a flat number.

## Margin Threshold Gates

Beyond the floor price, the Pricing Governance Model includes **margin threshold gates** — minimum gross margin requirements that trigger different approval paths depending on where the proposed deal falls relative to margin targets.

The first gate is your target margin — the margin at which the deal is profitable and aligned with your business model. For most AI products in 2026, this target is fifty-five to sixty-five percent gross margin. Deals above this threshold need only rep-level or manager-level approval, depending on the discount depth.

The second gate is your minimum acceptable margin — the lowest margin at which a deal is still worth doing as a purely financial matter. This might be thirty to forty percent for AI products, depending on your operating cost structure. Deals between the target margin and the minimum margin require VP-level approval and a documented rationale for accepting below-target profitability.

The third gate is the floor — below which deals do not happen. Deals that would fall below this margin level are rejected unless the executive override process is invoked, with a full written business case, a payback timeline, and a review trigger at a specified date.

The gates must be calculated dynamically. A deal's margin is not a static number — it depends on the customer's expected usage pattern, the current model inference costs, and any committed service levels. Your deal desk needs a margin calculator that takes a proposed price, a customer usage estimate, and current cost-to-serve inputs, and outputs the expected margin. The calculator should update automatically as model provider pricing changes — because a deal that was at forty percent margin when quoted might be at thirty-five percent by the time it closes if your inference provider raised prices in the interim.

## Strategic Discount Categories

Not all discounts are created equal. The Pricing Governance Model should define specific categories of strategic discounts, each with its own approval criteria, documentation requirements, and review processes.

**Land deals** are discounts offered to win a new customer with the explicit expectation of expansion. The justification is that the customer will grow into a larger, more profitable account over time. Land deals should require a documented expansion plan — not "we think they'll expand" but "the customer has confirmed that they will roll out to three additional departments within twelve months if the initial deployment is successful, and the expanded deployment will be at list price." Land deals should also have a review trigger: if the expansion has not materialized within the agreed timeline, the price reverts to list on renewal.

**Competitive displacement deals** are discounts offered to win a customer away from a specific competitor. These are justified when the competitive intelligence supports it — when you have evidence that the competitor's pricing is genuinely lower and the customer will choose the alternative without a discount. The discount should be tied to the competitive price, not to an arbitrary number. If the competitor is twenty percent cheaper, a twenty percent discount matches the competitive price. A thirty percent discount goes beyond matching and enters margin destruction territory.

**Logo acquisition deals** are discounts offered to win a customer whose brand value, industry influence, or reference potential justifies a below-market price. These are the most dangerous category because they are the easiest to abuse. Every sales rep believes their prospect is a "strategic logo." The governance model should define specific criteria for what qualifies as a logo deal — perhaps only companies on a pre-approved target list, or only companies that have signed a case study commitment as part of the deal terms. Logo deals without a concrete, contractual reference commitment are just discounted deals with a narrative.

**Volume commitment deals** offer a lower per-unit price in exchange for a contractual commitment to a minimum usage volume. These are legitimate pricing mechanisms because the volume commitment provides revenue predictability that has real value. The governance model should define the discount schedule for volume commitments — perhaps five percent for a twelve-month commitment at 1.5 times current usage, ten percent for a twenty-four-month commitment at two times current usage. The discount is earned by the commitment, not negotiated from the relationship.

## The Discount Audit Trail

Every discount approved through the governance model must be documented with five pieces of information: who requested it, who approved it, the justification category, the specific rationale, and the expected margin impact. This documentation is not bureaucratic overhead. It is the data that powers your quarterly discount analysis and your long-term pricing optimization.

The audit trail reveals patterns that are invisible in aggregate revenue data. It shows which reps discount most frequently and most deeply. It shows which customer segments receive the largest discounts. It shows which justification categories are used most often — and if "competitive pressure" is the justification for seventy percent of discounts, that tells you either your list pricing is too high relative to the market or your reps are using competitive pressure as a catch-all excuse.

The audit trail also protects the organization from individual bad actors. Without documentation, a manager who approves deep discounts to close deals and hit their quarterly target has no accountability. With documentation, the quarterly review reveals that this manager approved fifteen deals at twenty-five percent or more discount, with justifications that are vague or repetitive. The pattern becomes visible and actionable.

## The Quarterly Discount Review

Governance is not a policy you set and forget. It is a living system that requires regular analysis and adjustment. The quarterly discount review is the mechanism that keeps the system honest.

The review should answer five questions. First, what was the average discount by customer segment, deal size, and sales team? If one team averages twelve percent and another averages twenty-two percent on similar deals, the difference warrants investigation. Second, what was the distribution of discounts by approval tier? If forty percent of deals required VP-level approval, either the rep-level thresholds are too tight or the reps are not trying to close deals at higher price points. Third, what is the correlation between discount depth and retention? If deeply discounted customers churn at the same rate as full-price customers, the discounts are not buying loyalty — they are just giving away margin. Fourth, what is the correlation between discount depth and expansion? If deeply discounted customers expand less than full-price customers, the land-and-expand thesis is not working. Fifth, are any discount justification categories being systematically misused?

The output of the quarterly review should be a set of specific actions: adjusting the authority tier thresholds, revising the floor price based on updated cost-to-serve data, retraining specific sales teams on pricing discipline, and updating the approved target list for logo deals. The review should also calculate the **margin leakage** — the difference between what revenue would have been at full list price and what it actually was after discounts. This number, expressed as a dollar amount, makes the cost of discounting visceral in a way that percentages do not. "Our average discount was eighteen percent" sounds manageable. "We left $2.8 million in margin on the table last quarter through discounting" provokes action.

## Clawback Mechanisms for Broken Promises

Strategic discounts often come with promises from the customer: volume commitments, expansion timelines, reference agreements, multi-year renewals. When those promises do not materialize, the discount no longer has a justification — but the reduced price is already locked into the contract. This is where **clawback mechanisms** protect your margins.

A clawback is a contractual provision that adjusts the price if the conditions that justified the discount are not met. The most common form is a volume commitment clawback: the customer receives a discounted per-unit rate in exchange for committing to a minimum usage volume, and if actual usage falls below the commitment, the customer either pays the difference between the discounted rate and the list rate on the volume shortfall, or their rate reverts to list price for the next period.

Clawbacks should be written into the contract at the time of the deal, not negotiated retroactively. The language should be specific: "If actual usage in any quarter falls below seventy-five percent of the committed volume, the per-unit rate for the subsequent quarter reverts to the standard list rate of the applicable tier." The specificity matters because vague clawback language is unenforceable and will be ignored by both parties.

The enforcement of clawbacks is where most companies fail. The contract includes the provision, but when the trigger is hit, the customer success team is reluctant to enforce it because they fear damaging the relationship. The sales rep who closed the deal lobbies against enforcement because the customer is "about to expand" or "going through a tough quarter." The clawback sits in the contract, unused, and the customer learns that commitments are suggestions, not obligations. The governance model must assign enforcement responsibility to the finance or deal desk function — not to the relationship owner — and must make enforcement the default action that requires executive approval to waive, not the other way around.

## Connecting Governance to Layer 6 of the AI Pricing Stack

Layer 6 of the AI Pricing Stack is **Contractual Risk Adjustment** — the mechanisms you build into contracts to manage the financial risk that is unique to AI products. Pricing governance is the organizational implementation of Layer 6. Without governance, your contracts might include beautiful risk adjustment language — volume commitments, minimum spend clauses, annual price escalators, clawback provisions — but the actual deals closed by your sales team include none of it because nobody enforced the standard terms.

The connection works in both directions. The AI Pricing Stack defines what risk adjustment mechanisms should exist in your contracts. The Pricing Governance Model defines who has authority to modify, waive, or strengthen those mechanisms on a per-deal basis. A rep who removes the minimum spend clause to close a deal should need the same level of approval as a rep who offers a thirty percent discount, because removing a contractual protection has the same margin impact as reducing the price — it just shows up later, when the customer underperforms the commitment that was never actually committed.

This perspective reframes governance from "pricing bureaucracy" to "margin infrastructure." Every approval tier, every floor price, every audit requirement exists to protect the margin structure that makes your business viable. The companies that frame it this way get buy-in from their sales teams. The companies that frame it as control and restriction get compliance grudgingly at best and circumvention at worst.

Section 29 covers the broader enterprise governance frameworks that this pricing governance model fits within. The principles are the same — clear authority, documented decisions, regular review, consequences for violations — applied specifically to the pricing decisions that have the most direct impact on your unit economics.

## Building the Governance Muscle

Implementing pricing governance in an organization that has never had it is a change management challenge as much as a policy challenge. Sales teams that have operated with full discount discretion will resist having that discretion curtailed. The resistance is not irrational — from their perspective, discount authority is a tool they use to close deals, and you are taking it away.

The transition works best when it is framed around data, not authority. Show the sales team the margin leakage numbers. Show them the deals that looked like wins but were margin-negative. Show them the correlation between deep discounting and customer churn. When the data makes the case, the policy feels like a correction, not a punishment. Pair the governance implementation with investments that help the sales team succeed without deep discounts — better competitive intelligence, sharper value messaging, customer success stories that justify premium pricing.

The timeline matters too. Do not implement full governance overnight. Start with reporting — require discount documentation for sixty days before introducing approval requirements. Let the organization see its own discounting patterns before constraining them. Then introduce the authority tiers, starting with the floor price and the executive override gate. Add the margin threshold gates once the organization has adapted to the basic structure. The companies that try to implement everything at once get organizational rebellion. The companies that build governance incrementally build pricing discipline that lasts.

All of these governance mechanisms — the authority tiers, the floor prices, the margin gates, the audit trails, the quarterly reviews — compose a system. And like any system, it has a maturity curve. The final subchapter of this section maps that curve from end to end, defining what pricing capability looks like at each stage of organizational growth and providing the roadmap for building the pricing operation that your AI business demands.
