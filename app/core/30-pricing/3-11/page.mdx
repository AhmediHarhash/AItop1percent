# 30.3.11 — Multi-Product Pricing: When Your Platform Has AI and Non-AI Features

What happens when half your product costs nothing to run and the other half costs real money every time a user touches it?

This is not a theoretical question. It is the daily reality for the majority of software companies adding AI to existing products in 2026. You built a project management tool, a CRM, a document platform, a customer support suite — traditional SaaS with near-zero marginal cost per user. Then you added AI features: an assistant that drafts emails, a classifier that routes tickets, a summarizer that condenses meeting notes, an agent that automates workflows. The traditional features run on databases and application servers that cost pennies per interaction. The AI features run on foundation model APIs that cost dollars. Your product is now a chimera — half commodity software, half variable-cost AI — and your pricing model was designed for only one of those halves.

The tension is structural, not cosmetic. Your existing per-seat pricing was built on the assumption that each additional user adds negligible infrastructure cost. That assumption held when the most expensive thing a user could do was run a database query. It collapses when the most expensive thing a user can do is trigger a fifty-thousand-token reasoning chain on a frontier model. A customer paying $50 per user per month for your project management platform expects that price to cover everything the platform does. If "everything the platform does" now includes AI features that cost $3 to $8 per invocation, your margin on that seat depends entirely on how often the user reaches for the AI — and you have no control over that.

## The Four Approaches

There is no universally correct way to price a product that mixes zero-marginal-cost features with variable-cost AI features. But there are four established approaches, each with distinct implications for adoption, margin, and competitive positioning. Every multi-product company in 2026 is executing one of these four strategies, whether they chose it deliberately or stumbled into it.

**Approach one: AI as a premium tier add-on.** You keep your existing pricing tiers intact and offer AI as a separate add-on that customers purchase on top of their base plan. The add-on has its own price — typically $8 to $15 per user per month for horizontal AI features, $20 to $50 per user per month for specialized vertical AI capabilities. The customer decides whether to buy the AI or not. The base product works without it.

This was the dominant approach in 2024 and early 2025. Notion charged $8 per user per month for its AI add-on on top of its existing plan pricing. Other productivity platforms followed similar patterns. The logic was clean: AI costs money to deliver, so it should cost money to buy. The base product's economics remain undisturbed. The AI add-on is priced to cover its own variable costs with margin. And the separation makes it easy for customers to evaluate the AI independently from the platform.

The problem with the add-on approach emerged as adoption data accumulated. When AI is an add-on, it becomes an optional expense that budget-conscious teams evaluate quarterly. "Do we really need the AI add-on? We only used it for two features last month." The add-on structure invites scrutiny that embedded features never face. Adoption rates for AI add-ons have consistently underperformed what the same features achieve when bundled into the core product. Teams that have to opt in to AI use it less than teams that have it by default — and lower usage means lower value realization, which means higher churn at renewal.

The add-on approach also creates a fragmented user experience. Users on the base plan see AI-powered features grayed out or gated behind upgrade prompts. The product feels incomplete. The team that chose not to buy the add-on starts to feel like a second-class citizen on a platform that is clearly designed around AI. The product vision says "AI everywhere." The pricing says "AI for those who pay extra." The dissonance erodes satisfaction.

**Approach two: AI as a separate metered component.** Instead of a flat per-user add-on, you meter AI usage independently. The base product has its traditional per-seat price. AI usage is charged separately based on consumption — per query, per document processed, per task automated. The customer pays for AI only when they use it, and pays in proportion to how much they use.

This approach solves the adoption problem that add-ons create — there is no upfront commitment, so the barrier to trying AI is near zero. It also solves the margin problem because revenue scales directly with cost. Every AI query generates revenue that covers its own infrastructure cost.

But metered AI on top of a flat subscription creates billing complexity that customers hate. The customer now receives two charges: a predictable subscription and an unpredictable metered component. The subscription is budgeted quarterly. The metered component fluctuates monthly. Finance teams that approved the predictable subscription now have to monitor a variable cost they did not sign up for. For some enterprise buyers, the unpredictability of the metered component is enough to restrict AI access within their organization — which defeats the entire purpose.

The metered approach works best when the AI usage is clearly tied to quantifiable business value. If each AI query generates an identifiable outcome — a ticket resolved, a document classified, a lead scored — the metered charge feels justified because the customer can see the value per unit. When the AI usage is ambient — an assistant that helps draft messages, a summarizer that runs in the background, a search feature that understands natural language — the metered charge feels arbitrary because the customer cannot isolate the value of any individual query.

**Approach three: AI baked into all tiers with the cost absorbed.** You include AI features in every pricing tier and do not charge separately for them. The AI cost is absorbed into the existing per-seat price, which you may increase modestly to cover the new cost structure. The customer sees one price. AI is simply part of what the product does.

This approach maximizes adoption because there is no purchase decision for the AI. Every user has it. Every user uses it. The AI becomes part of the product's identity rather than an accessory. The user experience is seamless. The competitive positioning is strong: "AI is included" is a more compelling message than "AI available for an additional $10 per user."

The margin risk is significant. If your existing per-seat price is $50 and you absorb AI costs that average $6 per user per month, your gross margin on that seat drops from roughly ninety percent to roughly seventy-eight percent. If a subset of users turns out to be heavy AI consumers at $15 or $20 per user per month, the margin on those seats collapses further. You are running the Heavy User Problem described in subchapter 30.2.3, except the heavy users are heavy on the AI features specifically, and you have no pricing mechanism to capture the difference.

The companies that make this approach work offset the margin pressure through platform-level price increases. Notion discontinued its separate AI add-on in May 2025 and bundled AI capabilities exclusively into its Business and Enterprise tiers. The result was that teams wanting AI moved from the lower-priced Plus plan to the higher-priced Business plan at $20 per user per month. The AI is "included" — but only in tiers priced to support the AI cost. This is the bundling play: you do not charge for AI separately, but you restructure your tier boundaries so that the tiers that include AI are priced to sustain the AI economics.

**Approach four: AI as a separate product line.** You build the AI capability as a distinct product with its own branding, its own pricing, its own sales motion, and its own value proposition. The AI product integrates with your existing platform but is sold and priced independently. A customer can use the platform without the AI product. They can also use the AI product without the platform, connected to other tools.

This approach is most common when the AI capability is substantial enough to stand alone — not a feature enhancement but a full product. A CRM company that adds an AI sales agent is not adding a feature to the CRM. It is building a new product that happens to integrate with the CRM. The agent has its own pricing model (likely outcome-based or consumption-based), its own buyer persona (sales operations rather than sales reps), and its own value proposition (automated pipeline development rather than better contact management). Pricing it as a CRM add-on would undervalue it. Pricing it as a bundled feature would compress its margin into the CRM's economics.

The separate product approach gives you maximum pricing flexibility. You can price the AI product on outcomes, on usage, on value — whatever model fits the capability — without disrupting the existing platform's pricing. The trade-off is organizational complexity. You now have two products with two pricing models, two sales motions, and potentially two buyer personas within the same customer organization. The platform buyer is the IT director. The AI product buyer is the operations VP. If they have separate budgets, separate procurement processes, and separate evaluation criteria, you are effectively running two businesses.

## The Great Rebundling of 2026

The market is not static. After two years of experimentation, a pattern is emerging that industry analysts have called **the great rebundling**. Companies that launched AI as a separate add-on are bundling it back into their core product. Companies that priced AI on consumption are folding it into flat tiers with usage limits. The direction is clear: toward simplicity, toward inclusion, toward "AI is just part of what the product does."

The rebundling is driven by competitive pressure. When one major player in a category bundles AI into its base tier, every competitor in the category faces the same question from prospects: "Why do you charge extra for AI when your competitor includes it?" The answer "because AI costs real money to deliver" is technically true and commercially irrelevant. The customer does not care about your cost structure. They care about what they get for their money. If the competitor includes AI at $55 per seat and you charge $50 per seat plus $10 for AI, you are the more expensive option with the more confusing pricing. The math does not matter. The perception does.

The rebundling is also driven by data. Companies that have tracked AI feature adoption across add-on and bundled models report dramatically higher usage when AI is included by default. Higher usage leads to higher value realization. Higher value realization leads to higher retention. Higher retention leads to higher lifetime value. The margin hit from absorbing AI cost is offset by the lifetime value increase from better retention — and for most companies, the retention improvement more than compensates.

But rebundling has a ceiling. You can absorb AI costs into your per-seat price only as long as the AI costs are a manageable fraction of the total seat revenue. If AI costs represent ten to fifteen percent of per-seat revenue, absorption works. If AI costs represent thirty to forty percent — because the AI features are deeply capable, heavily used, and running on expensive models — absorption destroys your margin. The companies hitting this ceiling are the ones creating separate AI product lines or moving to hybrid models where a base platform fee includes standard AI and premium AI capabilities carry their own pricing.

## The Margin Math of Multi-Product Pricing

The pricing model you choose for the AI layer determines the margin structure of the entire platform. The math is worth running explicitly because the differences are not marginal — they are existential.

Consider a platform with 5,000 users at $60 per user per month. Traditional SaaS gross margin: eighty-eight percent. Revenue: $300,000 per month. Cost of goods sold: $36,000 per month. Gross profit: $264,000 per month.

Now add AI features with an average cost of $7 per user per month — $35,000 in new monthly cost across the user base. Under the add-on model at $12 per user per month with fifty percent adoption, you generate $30,000 in new AI revenue on $17,500 in AI costs for adopting users. Blended platform gross margin: roughly eighty-two percent. The margin drops modestly, AI revenue covers AI costs, and non-adopters subsidize nothing.

Under the bundled model with a price increase from $60 to $65 per user per month, you generate $25,000 in incremental revenue on $35,000 in new costs — because every user now has AI, whether they use it heavily or not. Blended gross margin: roughly eighty-four percent. The margin compression is slightly less than the add-on model if the price increase sticks, but the full-base cost exposure means your margin is more sensitive to AI usage growth.

Under the metered model with AI priced at $0.15 per query and an average of forty queries per user per month, you generate $30,000 in metered AI revenue on $35,000 in AI costs across all users. Blended margin: roughly eighty-three percent — but with significant variance. Light AI users generate $2 per month in AI revenue on $1 in costs. Heavy AI users generate $12 in AI revenue on $20 in costs. The metered model tracks cost better than the bundled model but still has margin dispersion at the user level.

Under the separate product model, pricing the AI capability at $25,000 per year per company with usage limits, you decouple the platform economics from the AI economics entirely. The platform maintains its eighty-eight percent margin. The AI product targets seventy percent margin on its own. Each business stands or falls on its own numbers. The trade-off is that the AI product must justify its standalone price, which is a harder sales conversation than "it is included."

## Choosing the Right Model for Your Product

The choice between these four approaches depends on three variables that are specific to your product and market.

The first variable is **AI cost intensity** — what percentage of per-user revenue the AI features consume. If AI cost represents less than fifteen percent of per-user revenue, bundling is almost always the right answer. The margin impact is manageable, adoption benefits from inclusion, and the competitive simplicity of "AI included" outweighs the margin compression. If AI cost represents fifteen to thirty percent of per-user revenue, an add-on or metered model makes economic sense because bundling would compress margins to unsustainable levels. If AI cost represents more than thirty percent, the AI is significant enough to warrant its own product line and its own pricing.

The second variable is **AI feature centrality** — how central the AI features are to the product's core value proposition. If the AI is an enhancement to existing capabilities — smarter search, better recommendations, automated summaries — it should be bundled or offered as a lightweight add-on. Charging separately for something that makes the core product better feels punitive. If the AI is a new capability that delivers standalone value — an autonomous agent, a complex analysis engine, a creative generation tool — it can sustain separate pricing because the customer perceives it as a distinct product with distinct value.

The third variable is **competitive context** — how your competitors are pricing their AI features. If the market consensus is moving toward bundling, charging separately puts you at a positioning disadvantage regardless of the economic rationale. If the market is split, you have more freedom to choose the model that fits your economics. If you are the market leader, your pricing choice will likely influence what the market does next — a responsibility that should inform the decision.

## The Transition From Feature to Platform

Multi-product pricing is not a one-time decision. It evolves as the AI capabilities in your product evolve. Most companies follow a predictable trajectory.

In the first phase, AI features are experimental. You add a few AI-powered enhancements to the existing product. The cost is low. The features are limited. Bundling makes sense because the economic impact is negligible and the adoption benefit is high.

In the second phase, AI features become substantial. The cost grows. The features become differentiated. Some users are heavy AI consumers. Bundling starts to strain margins. You introduce an add-on or a premium tier to capture the cost differential without disrupting the base product's economics.

In the third phase, the AI becomes the product. The traditional features are table stakes — every competitor has them. The AI capabilities are the differentiation, the growth engine, the reason new customers buy. At this point, the pricing needs to reflect that the AI is not an add-on to a software platform. The software platform is an add-on to an AI product. The pricing inverts. The platform fee becomes a base that enables the AI, and the AI capabilities carry the premium pricing.

Recognizing where you are in this trajectory matters because the right pricing model at each phase is different. Bundling in phase one, tiering or add-ons in phase two, and AI-first pricing in phase three. The companies that get stuck — running phase-one bundled pricing when they are actually in phase two, or maintaining phase-two add-on pricing when the AI has become the core product — create friction between their pricing model and their product reality. That friction shows up as margin erosion, competitive vulnerability, or customer confusion about what exactly they are paying for.

## The Internal Politics of Multi-Product Pricing

The hardest part of multi-product pricing is not the economic modeling. It is the organizational politics. The team that built the traditional product sees the AI features as enhancements to their platform. The team that built the AI features sees the platform as a distribution channel for their AI. Both are right. Both believe their contribution justifies the majority of the revenue. Both resist pricing structures that subordinate their work.

This tension is productive when managed well and destructive when ignored. The resolution is a shared P and L that attributes revenue and cost accurately to each component. When the platform team can see that the AI features drive twenty-five percent of new customer acquisition and the AI team can see that the platform's installed base drives eighty percent of AI feature adoption, both sides understand their interdependence. Neither is the product. Together they are the product. The pricing model should reflect that interdependence — which is exactly what hybrid models, tiered structures, and platform-plus-AI architectures are designed to do.

The question of how to price AI within a multi-product platform leads naturally to the next dimension of pricing strategy: packaging. How you structure tiers, feature gates, usage limits, and expansion paths determines whether your pricing model translates into actual purchasing behavior. Packaging is where pricing strategy meets the customer's buy button, and it is the subject of the next chapter.
