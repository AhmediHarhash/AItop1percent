# 30.6.10 — The Build-vs-Buy Benchmark: Competing Against Internal AI Teams

The head of engineering leans back in his chair and looks at the procurement team's summary. Your product costs $340,000 per year for the department. He pulls up a napkin calculation on his screen: raw API costs for the same volume of queries, approximately $48,000. Two mid-level engineers to build and maintain the integration, $380,000 fully loaded. Cloud infrastructure and tooling, maybe $25,000. Evaluation and monitoring overhead, another $15,000. Total internal build cost: roughly $468,000 in year one, dropping to about $280,000 in year two once the engineering effort shifts from building to maintenance. Your product is cheaper than building in year one. It is more expensive than building in year two. He closes the laptop and tells the procurement team to schedule the vendor call but also to start scoping the internal alternative. He wants both options on his desk by the end of the quarter.

This scene plays out in every enterprise AI purchase decision in 2026. The calculation is not always on a napkin — sometimes it is a formal make-versus-buy analysis produced by a consulting firm, sometimes it is a spreadsheet from the CTO's office, sometimes it is a gut sense from an engineering leader who believes their team can build anything a vendor can. But the calculation always happens, and it always produces the same question: is this vendor's product worth more than what we could build ourselves with raw API access and our existing engineering talent?

The **Build-vs-Buy Benchmark** is the competitive anchor that sets the ceiling on your pricing. Not the theoretical ceiling of the value you deliver. The practical ceiling of what the buyer will actually pay before they decide to build internally. Understanding this benchmark — how buyers calculate it, where their calculation is accurate, and where it is systematically wrong — is one of the most important pricing skills in AI product economics.

## How Enterprise Buyers Calculate the Build Option

Enterprise buyers assemble the build cost from four components, and they almost always underestimate two of them.

The first component is **raw API cost**. This is the one buyers calculate most accurately because the information is public. The buyer visits the model provider's pricing page, estimates their query volume, estimates average tokens per query, and multiplies. For a product handling ten thousand queries per day with an average of two thousand tokens per query, the monthly API cost on a mid-tier model like Claude Sonnet 4.5 or GPT-5-mini might land between $2,000 and $6,000 depending on the provider and the model. At the enterprise tier with committed spend discounts, the cost might be thirty to forty percent lower. This component of the build calculation is straightforward and usually within twenty percent of reality.

The second component is **engineering cost**. This is where the first systematic underestimate occurs. The buyer estimates two to three engineers for three to four months to build the initial integration. That estimate is usually correct for a prototype that works in a demo. It is wildly wrong for a production system that handles edge cases, scales reliably, maintains quality over time, and satisfies the compliance requirements of the enterprise. The actual engineering cost to build a production-grade AI feature — not a demo, not a prototype, but a system that enterprise users depend on daily — typically requires four to six engineers for six to nine months of initial build, plus ongoing maintenance that consumes one to two full-time engineers indefinitely. The buyer's estimate of $380,000 for two engineers is closer to $900,000 to $1.2 million when you count the real headcount, the real timeline, and the opportunity cost of those engineers not working on the company's core product.

The third component is **infrastructure and tooling cost**. This includes the prompt management systems, evaluation infrastructure, monitoring dashboards, logging and audit systems, and deployment pipelines required to run AI in production. The buyer typically estimates this at $20,000 to $50,000 per year. The actual cost is two to five times higher once you include the evaluation tooling required for quality monitoring, the observability stack required for debugging production issues, the data pipeline required for continuous improvement, and the security infrastructure required for compliance. An enterprise running AI in a regulated industry — healthcare, financial services, legal — adds another layer of compliance tooling that can cost $100,000 to $300,000 per year on its own.

The fourth component is **ongoing maintenance cost**. This is the second systematic underestimate and the one that kills most internal build projects. The buyer assumes that once the system is built, it runs. In reality, AI systems require continuous maintenance that traditional software does not. Models change behavior with every update. Prompts drift as the underlying model evolves. Evaluation suites need updating as use cases expand. Data pipelines need monitoring for quality degradation. New model releases create migration decisions that consume engineering time. The ongoing maintenance cost of an internal AI system is typically forty to sixty-five percent of the initial build cost per year, every year, for as long as the system runs. A system that cost $900,000 to build costs $400,000 to $600,000 per year to maintain. Over three years, the total cost of ownership is $1.7 to $2.1 million — for a capability that a vendor might provide for $340,000 per year, or roughly $1 million over three years.

## Where Build Wins: The Honest Assessment

Despite the systematic underestimates, there are use cases where building internally is genuinely the better economic decision, and pretending otherwise costs you credibility with buyers who have done the math correctly.

Build wins when the use case is **simple and standardized**. A company that needs basic document summarization, straightforward classification, or templated content generation can build this with two engineers in three months and maintain it with minimal ongoing effort. The prompts are simple. The evaluation is straightforward. The edge cases are few. The quality bar is not mission-critical. For these use cases, your product is competing against a build cost of $200,000 in year one and $80,000 per year thereafter. If your product costs more than that, the buyer should build. Your pricing should not even attempt to compete for these use cases unless you can deliver them as a commodity feature within a larger product.

Build wins when the company has **deep in-house AI expertise**. Companies with dedicated AI teams of ten or more engineers, existing ML infrastructure, and established evaluation practices can build sophisticated AI features at lower cost than companies building from scratch. These teams already have the tooling, the processes, and the institutional knowledge to avoid the common pitfalls. For these buyers, your product competes against an engineering team that is already being paid, already has the infrastructure, and views building AI features as part of their core mandate. Winning these customers requires differentiation that their internal team cannot replicate — proprietary data, domain-specific models, or regulatory compliance capabilities that would take them years to build.

Build also wins when the use case involves **deeply proprietary data and processes** that cannot be shared with an external vendor. A hedge fund with proprietary trading signals, a pharmaceutical company with pre-publication research data, or a defense contractor with classified information may not be able to use your product regardless of price because the data cannot leave their environment. For these buyers, the build decision is not about cost at all. It is about data sovereignty. You can compete only if you offer on-premise or private cloud deployment that keeps their data within their control — and your pricing for that deployment model must account for the lost efficiency of running outside your shared infrastructure.

## Where Buy Wins: Your Competitive Advantage

Buy wins — and your pricing power is strongest — in the categories where the internal build calculation systematically underestimates cost and overestimates capability.

Buy wins when the use case is **complex and rapidly evolving**. Legal contract analysis, medical document processing, multi-step financial compliance checking, customer support with escalation logic — these use cases involve edge cases that multiply faster than an internal team can address them. The initial build handles eighty percent of cases well. The remaining twenty percent consumes eighty percent of the ongoing engineering effort. A vendor specializing in the domain has amortized the cost of solving those edge cases across hundreds of customers. An internal team bears the full cost of discovering and solving them alone.

Buy wins when **model churn creates continuous maintenance burden**. In 2025-2026, major model providers release new model versions quarterly and deprecate old ones on twelve-to-eighteen-month cycles. Each model change is a potential quality event for any system built on top of it. A specialized vendor tracks model changes across providers, maintains compatibility across multiple models, and handles migrations as routine operations. An internal team faces each migration as a project that pulls engineers away from core product work. Over a three-year horizon, the migration burden alone can cost an internal team $200,000 to $400,000 in engineering time — a cost that rarely appears in the initial build estimate.

Buy wins when **regulatory compliance adds non-obvious costs**. An internal team building an AI feature for a healthcare product needs to ensure HIPAA compliance for the AI pipeline, build audit trails that survive regulatory review, implement bias monitoring required by state AI laws, and maintain documentation that demonstrates compliance with the EU AI Act if the product serves European markets. These compliance requirements are not optional, and they are not cheap. A vendor that has already built the compliance infrastructure amortizes that cost across their customer base. An internal team bears the full cost, which can exceed $500,000 per year for a properly implemented compliance program in regulated industries.

Buy wins when **time-to-value matters more than long-term cost**. An internal build takes six to nine months to reach production quality. A vendor integration takes two to six weeks. For a company racing to launch a product, enter a market, or respond to a competitive threat, the six-month gap is not just a timeline difference. It is a revenue difference. Six months of delayed deployment at $100,000 per month in expected revenue is $600,000 in opportunity cost that never appears in the build-versus-buy spreadsheet but dominates the actual business outcome.

## Pricing Against the Build Benchmark

Your pricing strategy must account for the build benchmark explicitly. This means your pricing has to land in a zone where the total cost of buying from you over three years is visibly better than the total cost of building internally over the same period — when the buyer uses accurate cost estimates, not the optimistic ones.

The three-year total cost of ownership comparison is the key battlefield. On the build side, accurate three-year TCO includes initial engineering at $900,000 to $1.2 million, ongoing maintenance at $400,000 to $600,000 per year, model migration costs at $100,000 to $200,000 per year, and compliance and tooling at $50,000 to $150,000 per year. That puts a realistic three-year build TCO at $2 million to $3.5 million for a non-trivial AI capability.

On the buy side, your three-year TCO is simply your annual price times three, plus implementation and integration costs in year one. If your product is priced at $400,000 per year with a $50,000 implementation fee, the three-year buy TCO is $1.25 million. The buy savings are $750,000 to $2.25 million over three years. That is a compelling business case for any procurement team.

The pricing trap is setting your price so high that the three-year buy TCO approaches the three-year build TCO. At $700,000 per year, your three-year TCO is $2.15 million — right in the middle of the build range. At that price point, the buyer's decision becomes a coin flip that depends on how they estimate their own engineering costs. Some will buy. Many will build. You have priced yourself into a competitive position where your win rate depends on the buyer's internal cost estimation accuracy, which is a variable you cannot control.

The optimal pricing zone for competing against the build benchmark is thirty to sixty percent of the realistic build TCO. At that level, the savings are large enough that even a buyer who underestimates build costs by thirty to forty percent still arrives at a buy decision. Your three-year price of $1.2 million versus a realistic build cost of $2.5 million is a clear buy signal even when the buyer's estimate of build cost is only $1.8 million.

## The Value Stack: Why You Are Worth More Than Build

Price alone does not win the build-versus-buy comparison. The most effective sales motion against internal build is the **value stack** — the enumeration of capabilities, costs, and risks that the buyer's spreadsheet systematically misses.

The first layer of the value stack is **speed**. You deploy in weeks. They build in months. The opportunity cost of delayed deployment is real revenue, real competitive position, and real market timing that the buyer loses by choosing to build.

The second layer is **quality amortization**. You have solved the edge cases across hundreds of customers. They will discover each edge case on their own, one production incident at a time. The quality advantage is not theoretical — it is measurable in error rates, escalation rates, and customer satisfaction scores.

The third layer is **continuous improvement without internal effort**. You ship improvements weekly — new model integrations, prompt optimizations, feature enhancements — included in the subscription. They ship improvements when engineers are available, which is never often enough because the AI system is not the company's core product and internal priorities will always pull engineering resources toward the core.

The fourth layer is **risk transfer**. When the AI makes a mistake, the vendor relationship includes SLAs, support, and in some cases contractual liability protection. When an internal build makes a mistake, the engineering team that built it is responsible, and they are probably already working on something else.

The fifth layer is **model provider management**. You handle provider negotiations, model migrations, deprecation management, multi-provider failover, and the entire risk register we covered in the previous subchapter. They handle all of this themselves, or more likely, they do not handle it at all until a model deprecation forces an emergency response.

## The Buyer Who Has Already Decided

Some buyers walk into the evaluation having already decided to build. They are running the vendor evaluation to satisfy a procurement process requirement, or to extract pricing information they can use to benchmark their internal build estimates, or because a VP mandated a competitive analysis even though the engineering team has already started building. You can identify these buyers by their questions: they focus on technical architecture details that only matter if you are trying to replicate the system, they ask for API response format specifications, and they show minimal interest in pricing or contract terms.

Do not waste sales resources on buyers who have already decided to build. Instead, offer them a graceful exit: a proof-of-concept period that lets them compare your product against their internal build on a real use case with real data. The buyers who are genuinely undecided will take you up on it. The buyers who have already decided will decline. Either way, you have qualified the opportunity efficiently and saved your team from a procurement process that was never going to end in a purchase.

## The Returning Builder

The most valuable sales motion in the build-versus-buy cycle targets the buyer who built internally and is now reconsidering. This buyer exists in large numbers because the systematic underestimation of maintenance costs means that internal AI projects frequently arrive at a crossroads twelve to eighteen months after launch: the system works but consumes more engineering resources than expected, the quality has plateaued because nobody has time to improve the evaluation suite, and the team that built it wants to move on to more interesting problems.

A16z's enterprise AI survey found that purchasing AI from specialized vendors succeeds about sixty-seven percent of the time, while internal builds succeed only about a third as often. The returning builder has lived this statistic. They know exactly what internal build costs because they have paid it. They have realistic expectations about what a vendor product should deliver because they have experienced the alternative. And they are highly motivated to switch because the engineering leadership is tired of maintaining a system that was supposed to be a three-month project and has become a permanent tax on the team.

Pricing for the returning builder is different from pricing for a first-time buyer. The returning builder does not need to be convinced that buy is better than build. They need to be shown that the migration from their internal system to your product is achievable without disrupting their users. Your pricing should include migration support — prompt migration, evaluation baseline transfer, parallel running period — either bundled into the annual price or offered as a one-time implementation fee. The migration cost is the returning builder's primary objection, and addressing it in the pricing removes the last barrier to conversion.

## The Build-vs-Buy Benchmark as Pricing Discipline

The build-versus-buy benchmark is not just a competitive threat. It is a pricing discipline that keeps you honest about your value proposition. Every quarter, as API costs fall and open-source models improve, the build option gets cheaper and more capable. Your product must deliver enough value above the raw build cost to justify the premium, and that gap must be real, not imagined.

The discipline works like this: every quarter, recalculate the realistic build cost for your core use case using current API pricing, current engineering salary data, and current tooling costs. Compare that three-year build TCO to your three-year price. If the gap is narrowing, either your value stack is eroding — because the commoditization dynamics from the previous subchapter are compressing your differentiation — or you have not invested enough in the non-compute value that justifies your premium. Either way, the benchmark forces a strategic conversation about where your product creates value that an internal team cannot replicate, and whether that value is growing or shrinking as the market evolves.

The companies that survive the build-versus-buy competition in 2026 and beyond are those that make the comparison irrelevant. Not by making internal build impossible — it never is — but by making the gap between what they deliver and what an internal team can deliver so wide that the calculation is obvious. When your domain expertise, your data advantage, your compliance infrastructure, your continuous improvement cycle, and your speed of deployment are all factored in, the buyer does not need a spreadsheet. The answer is clear. That is the pricing position worth building toward.

This concludes the chapter on model provider economics and cost volatility. You now understand the forces that shape your cost structure — provider dependency, commoditization pressure, and the competitive anchor of internal build alternatives. But understanding costs is only half the equation. The next chapter turns to the other half: the financial metrics, reporting frameworks, and investor narratives that translate your pricing and cost decisions into the language of revenue growth, gross margin trajectory, and business valuation.
