# 30.3.2 — When Per-Seat Still Works: The Harvey and GitHub Copilot Cases

The pricing committee has been debating for ninety minutes. The VP of Product wants consumption-based pricing because the cost-to-serve analysis from Chapter 2 shows a twelve-to-one ratio between the heaviest and lightest users. The VP of Sales wants per-seat because the enterprise pipeline will stall if buyers cannot calculate their annual spend in a single formula. The CFO is modeling both options on a spreadsheet and neither one produces margins that satisfy the board. Everyone agrees that per-seat is broken for AI. And yet two of the most successful AI products in 2026 — Harvey for legal and GitHub Copilot for software development — charge per-seat and are thriving. The question is not whether per-seat works. The question is what makes it work for them and whether those conditions apply to you.

## The Harvey Model: When Value Dwarfs Variance

Harvey charges approximately $1,200 per lawyer per month. That is not a typo. At twenty-seat minimums with twelve-month commitments, the annual entry point is roughly $288,000. Premium bundles push per-seat costs to $1,400 per month. By any traditional SaaS standard, this is an extraordinarily high price point. By the standard of what it replaces, it is a bargain.

A junior associate at a major law firm bills at $400 to $700 per hour. A mid-level associate bills at $600 to $1,000. A partner bills at $1,000 to $2,500. Harvey's value proposition is not "save a few minutes here and there." It is "a tool that can draft contract clauses, analyze regulatory filings, research case precedent, and summarize hundred-page agreements in minutes rather than hours." If Harvey saves a single associate four hours per week — a conservative estimate based on reported usage patterns — the time savings alone represent $8,000 to $16,000 per month in billable hour value. The $1,200 per month price represents seven to fifteen percent of the value created.

This ratio — price as a small fraction of demonstrable value — is the first condition that makes per-seat work. When the value per interaction is high enough, the variance in cost-to-serve becomes manageable because even the heaviest users are generating value that far exceeds their cost. A lawyer who runs fifty analyses per day on Harvey costs more to serve than one who runs five. But the lawyer running fifty analyses is saving the firm thirty to forty hours per week. The firm is not going to complain about the cost of that seat. They are going to buy more seats.

## Why Legal Work Constrains the Variance

The second condition Harvey benefits from is **bounded usage variance**. Legal work is fundamentally sequential. A lawyer works on one matter at a time, reviews one document at a time, drafts one brief at a time. There are only so many hours in a day, and legal professionals — even with AI acceleration — do not process documents at the pace that, say, an automated data pipeline would.

This is critical for per-seat economics. In products where usage can be automated or scaled programmatically — an AI analytics tool that users can set to run continuously, a document processing system that can be integrated into an automated pipeline — the variance between users is effectively unlimited. One user might trigger ten queries per month manually, while another hooks the product into a batch processing system that triggers ten thousand queries per month. That kind of variance destroys per-seat pricing.

Legal AI does not face this problem at the same scale. The heaviest Harvey user is still constrained by the pace of human legal work. The ratio between the lightest and heaviest users might be five to one or eight to one — significant, but not the thirty-to-one ratios that make per-seat untenable. Harvey's $1,200 price point provides enough gross margin headroom to absorb this level of variance. Even the heaviest user likely generates enough margin to be individually profitable, because the price is set high enough that the cost-to-serve ceiling is well below the revenue per seat.

## The GitHub Copilot Model: Strategic Subsidy as a Business Strategy

GitHub Copilot occupies the opposite end of the per-seat spectrum. At $10 per month for the Pro tier and $39 per month for the Pro Plus tier, Copilot's per-seat prices are low enough that the product is almost certainly margin-negative or margin-thin for heavy users. A developer who uses Copilot extensively — accepting hundreds of code completions per day, running multiple chat interactions, using it across multiple repositories — can generate meaningful compute cost. At the Pro tier, even moderate usage likely pushes the cost-to-serve close to the revenue per seat.

Microsoft does not care. Copilot is not priced to be independently profitable on a per-seat basis. It is priced to drive adoption of GitHub, which drives adoption of Azure, which drives adoption of the Microsoft developer ecosystem. The $10 per month price point is a **strategic subsidy** — Microsoft is willing to lose money or break even on Copilot seats because the downstream revenue from ecosystem lock-in is worth multiples of the Copilot subscription.

This became explicit in June 2025 when GitHub introduced metered billing for premium model requests. Once a user exceeds their monthly allocation of premium requests — fifty for Free, three hundred for Pro, fifteen hundred for Pro Plus — additional requests cost $0.04 each. The base per-seat price gets the developer in the door. The metered overage captures the cost of heavy usage. It is no longer pure per-seat pricing. It is per-seat with a consumption safety valve.

The strategic subsidy model works when three conditions are met. First, the company must have a larger business that benefits from the product's adoption — an ecosystem play, a platform play, or a data flywheel that generates value beyond the product's direct revenue. Second, the company must have the balance sheet to absorb the subsidy — this is a game for Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, not for a Series B startup. Third, the subsidy must be temporary or bounded — GitHub's metered billing shows that even Microsoft eventually needs to align cost with revenue for heavy users.

## The Three Conditions Framework

Across Harvey, GitHub Copilot, and the broader market, per-seat pricing works for AI products when at least one of three conditions is met. If none of these conditions apply to your product, per-seat pricing will erode your margins over time, and the erosion will accelerate as your best customers increase their usage.

**Condition one: the price point is high enough to absorb variance.** Harvey charges $1,200 per month. At that price, even a heavy user who costs $300 per month to serve generates seventy-five percent gross margin on that seat. The price point creates a buffer large enough that cost-to-serve variance does not threaten profitability. This condition typically requires a product that replaces or augments expensive human labor — legal work, medical analysis, financial advisory — where the value per interaction is measured in hundreds or thousands of dollars.

**Condition two: usage variance is naturally bounded.** The product's use case constrains how much any single user can consume. Legal research is bounded by the pace of human work. Code completion is bounded by the speed of writing code. Medical diagnosis is bounded by patient volume. If your product can be integrated into automated pipelines, batch processing systems, or always-on monitoring — use cases where a single "user" can generate thousands of interactions without human involvement — usage variance is unbounded and per-seat pricing will fail.

**Condition three: a strategic subsidy covers the gap.** The company has a business reason to price below cost-to-serve, and the financial capacity to sustain it. This is rare. It requires either a platform ecosystem play or a market-capture strategy funded by a well-capitalized parent. Startups cannot afford strategic subsidies. Even large companies can sustain them only for a defined period before the economics need to converge.

Most AI products in 2026 meet none of these three conditions. Their price points are in the $50 to $500 per user range — too low to absorb wide variance. Their products can be used at highly variable rates depending on the customer's workflow and integration depth. And they do not have a parent company's balance sheet to subsidize the gap. For these products — which represent the majority of the AI market — per-seat is a pricing model that feels right and fails quietly.

## The Hybrid Pivot: What Harvey and Copilot Tell Us About the Future

Even the per-seat success stories are evolving. Harvey is reportedly moving toward more outcome-based pricing as its workflows become more complex and its value proposition extends beyond time savings into actual work product delivery. GitHub Copilot added metered billing for premium requests, introducing consumption pricing alongside the per-seat base. Neither company abandoned per-seat entirely, but both recognized that pure per-seat has limits even under favorable conditions.

The pattern is instructive. Per-seat serves as an anchor — a familiar entry point that buyers understand and procurement can approve. But the companies that sustain healthy margins layer usage-based or outcome-based components on top of the per-seat base. The seat price covers access and a baseline level of usage. The variable component captures the incremental cost and value of heavy usage. This hybrid is not a compromise. It is an evolution that preserves the benefits of per-seat — simplicity, predictability, buyer familiarity — while addressing the fundamental limitation that AI's variable cost structure imposes.

The question for your product is not "should I charge per-seat?" It is "do I meet the conditions that make per-seat viable, and if so, do I need a usage-based component to protect my margins at the heavy end of the distribution?" If you meet at least one of the three conditions and your cost-to-serve analysis shows manageable variance, per-seat with a usage-based overlay can work. If you meet none of the conditions, per-seat is a ticking margin problem and you need a fundamentally different approach.

## The Trap of Copying Without Context

The most dangerous thing about the Harvey and Copilot examples is that founders cite them as justification for per-seat pricing without understanding why those specific products can afford it. "Harvey charges per-seat and they are a billion-dollar company" is not an argument for per-seat pricing at your startup. Harvey can charge per-seat because they charge $1,200 per month in a market where the replacement cost is $500-per-hour lawyer time. Your product charges $150 per month in a market where the replacement cost is a $25-per-hour operations team. The conditions are not transferable.

Similarly, "GitHub Copilot charges $10 per seat" is not an argument for low per-seat pricing. Microsoft can sustain a $10 per seat price because Copilot drives Azure consumption that generates multiples of the subscription revenue. Your startup does not have an Azure. Copying Copilot's per-seat price without Copilot's ecosystem economics is not strategy. It is subsidy without a business model.

The right lesson from Harvey and Copilot is not that per-seat works. It is that per-seat works under specific, identifiable conditions, and that even the best per-seat AI products are adding consumption components as usage scales. The model everyone understands is adapting to the economics that are breaking it. For the majority of AI products that do not meet the three conditions, the alternative is consumption-based pricing — a model that aligns cost with revenue but introduces a new set of problems that are just as dangerous if you do not design for them.
