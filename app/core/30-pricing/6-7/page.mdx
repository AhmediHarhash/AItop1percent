# 30.6.7 — Passing Cost Savings to Customers vs Capturing Them as Margin

Most teams get this decision backwards. When a model provider cuts prices by fifty percent, the instinct is to pass the savings to customers immediately — lower your prices, announce the reduction, earn goodwill. This instinct feels generous. It feels customer-centric. And in most situations, it is wrong. Not because generosity is bad, but because reflexive pass-through treats a strategic pricing decision as a customer service gesture, and the consequences of that confusion compound over years.

The reverse mistake is equally dangerous. A company that captures every cost reduction as margin while competitors pass savings to customers wakes up one morning to discover that its price is thirty percent above the market and its churn rate has doubled. The customers who tolerated premium pricing when everyone's costs were similar do not tolerate it when they know the underlying costs have dropped. Hoarding savings is not a strategy. It is a delay.

The decision between passing cost savings to customers and capturing them as margin is one of the most consequential pricing decisions an AI company makes. It is not a one-time choice. It is a recurring decision that you face every time a model provider adjusts pricing, every time your engineering team deploys a new optimization, and every time a competitor changes the market's price expectations. Getting it right requires a framework, not an instinct.

## The Cost Pass-Through Spectrum

Think of this decision as a spectrum, not a binary. At one end is **full pass-through**: every dollar you save in cost-to-serve becomes a dollar of price reduction for the customer. At the other end is **full capture**: every dollar you save stays on your income statement as margin improvement. Between these extremes lie the positions where most companies should operate.

Full pass-through is the right move only under specific competitive conditions. If your primary competitor just cut prices and your customers are actively evaluating alternatives, passing savings through is defensive — you are maintaining competitive parity, not being generous. If you are in a market where buyers compare per-query or per-token prices directly, and your competitor's price drop is visible, matching it is table stakes. In these situations, the "decision" to pass through savings is not really a decision. It is a requirement imposed by competitive dynamics.

Full capture is the right move under different conditions. If you are below your target gross margin and your competitors are not pressuring your price, capturing the savings to strengthen your margin position is the financially rational choice. If your product is differentiated enough that customers are not making purchasing decisions based on per-query cost, the savings are yours to keep. If you need the margin to fund product investment that will widen your differentiation, capturing savings now to invest in features that justify your price later is a legitimate strategy.

Between these extremes, the most common and usually correct approach is **partial pass-through**: you pass some of the savings to customers and capture the rest as margin. The ratio depends on your current position and the specific conditions at the moment the decision arises.

## The Four-Factor Decision Framework

Four factors determine where you should land on the pass-through spectrum. Each factor points toward pass-through or capture, and the combination of all four gives you your answer.

**Factor One: Your Current Gross Margin Relative to Target.** This is the most important factor and the one most teams ignore. If your target gross margin is seventy percent and you are currently at fifty-five percent, you have a fifteen-point margin gap. Capturing cost savings to close that gap is not greed — it is survival. A company operating at fifty-five percent gross margin in a market where the benchmark is seventy percent has less money to invest in product, less money to invest in sales, less resilience against future cost increases, and a lower company valuation. Closing the margin gap should take priority over lowering prices, unless competitive pressure makes pass-through unavoidable.

Conversely, if your target is seventy percent and you are already at seventy-eight percent, you have margin to spare. Passing some savings to customers — or investing them in product improvements that justify the current price — is the more sustainable choice. Operating at margins significantly above your target invites competition. Competitors look at your pricing, calculate that you have twenty-plus percent gross margin headroom, and know they can undercut you and still be profitable. Excess margin is a competitive invitation.

**Factor Two: Competitive Price Pressure.** Is a competitor actively undercutting your price? Have they announced a price reduction? Are you losing deals where pricing was cited as the primary objection? If the answer to any of these is yes, you are under price pressure, and passing savings through is likely necessary to maintain your competitive position. If the answer to all of these is no — your win rate is stable, pricing objections are rare, competitors have not moved — there is no immediate reason to lower your price. Capture the savings.

The nuance here is anticipatory versus reactive pass-through. Reactive pass-through — lowering your price because a competitor already lowered theirs — is often too late. By the time you react, customers have already noticed the gap, and your price reduction looks like you were forced into it rather than choosing it. Anticipatory pass-through — lowering your price proactively before competitive pressure builds — positions you as the price leader and makes it harder for competitors to gain share through pricing. But anticipatory pass-through requires confidence that competitive pressure is coming, which requires intelligence about competitor pricing, customer conversations, and market dynamics. Do not anticipate pressure that may never arrive. Save anticipatory moves for situations where the competitive shift is visible and imminent.

**Factor Three: Customer Expectation of Cost Sharing.** Some customers — particularly large enterprises with sophisticated procurement teams — actively track model provider pricing. When OpenAI cuts GPT-5 pricing by forty percent and that cut is announced publicly, your enterprise customer's procurement director will calculate what that cut means for your cost-to-serve and will expect some of the savings to flow to them. If your contract includes a cost-of-infrastructure adjustment clause — which Section 30.5.1 recommends — the customer may have a contractual basis to request a price adjustment.

In B2B markets where your customers understand the underlying cost structure, pretending that a major cost reduction did not happen is not a viable strategy. Your customers read the same news you do. When Anthropic announces a fifty percent price cut on Claude Opus, your customer who knows you use Claude Opus will ask about it at the next quarterly business review. The question is not whether to acknowledge the savings but how much to share.

The effective approach is transparency with framing. Acknowledge the cost reduction. Explain that you are investing a portion of the savings into product improvements, infrastructure reliability, and quality enhancements that benefit the customer. And pass through a portion — typically twenty to forty percent of the savings — as a price reduction or a value-add that the customer can point to as a win. The customer feels they are getting a fair share. You retain the majority of the savings. Both parties feel the relationship is balanced.

**Factor Four: Your Investment Roadmap.** Cost savings that fund product investment are not captured margin in the exploitative sense. They are reinvested margin. If you have a roadmap of features, quality improvements, and infrastructure investments that will increase the value your product delivers, retaining cost savings to fund those investments is a legitimate choice — as long as you can articulate the connection between the investment and the customer value.

"We are retaining the savings to improve our bottom line" is not a message that earns customer trust. "We are investing the savings into a new quality monitoring system that will improve accuracy by fifteen percent and a latency optimization that will cut response times in half" is a message that customers can support, because they benefit from the investment. The key is that the investment must be real, the timeline must be concrete, and the customer must eventually see the result. Using "investment" as a permanent excuse to never pass through savings is transparent and corrosive.

## The Asymmetry Trap

There is a dangerous asymmetry in this decision. Passing savings to customers is easy to announce, easy for the customer to understand, and creates immediate goodwill. Capturing savings as margin is invisible to the customer, difficult to explain if discovered, and creates suspicion if the customer learns about the cost reduction without seeing a price adjustment.

This asymmetry creates a behavioral bias toward pass-through. It feels better to give. It is easier to communicate. Sales teams prefer it because it makes renewals easier. Customer success teams prefer it because it makes QBRs pleasant. The CFO is the only person in the room arguing for margin capture, and they are outnumbered.

The discipline required is to make this decision based on the four factors, not on which option is easier to communicate. A company that always passes savings through because it is the path of least internal resistance will end up with margins too thin to survive the next cost increase. Model provider pricing does not only go down. When a provider introduces a new, more capable model at a premium price, or deprecates the model you depend on and replaces it with a more expensive alternative, your costs go up. If you passed every previous savings to customers, you have no margin buffer to absorb the increase — and now you face the painful conversation of raising prices, which is far harder than the conversation you avoided when you chose to pass savings through instead of building margin.

The healthy pattern is to build a **margin reserve** during periods of cost decline so that you have a buffer during periods of cost increase. If model provider pricing drops by forty percent over two years, capturing half of that savings builds a twenty-point margin buffer. When pricing increases by fifteen percent the following year — because you migrate to a newer model, because the provider restructures its tiers, because your usage pattern shifts — you absorb the increase from the buffer without touching customer pricing. Your customers experience stable pricing. Your margins fluctuate within a planned range. Neither party is surprised.

## Segment Your Pass-Through Strategy

Not all customers should receive the same pass-through treatment. Your largest enterprise accounts with the most pricing visibility and the most negotiating leverage should see more pass-through — not because they deserve it more, but because they are the most likely to demand it, and preemptive pass-through is cheaper than reactive renegotiation. Your mid-market customers who do not track model provider pricing and are less likely to demand adjustments can receive pass-through in the form of feature improvements rather than price reductions. Your smallest customers on self-serve plans may not require any adjustment at all — they chose your product at the listed price, and a small cost reduction is unlikely to affect their purchasing decision.

This segmented approach is not discriminatory. It is efficient allocation of the savings pool. A ten percent price reduction for a $500,000 enterprise account saves the customer $50,000 and earns significant goodwill plus renewal security. A ten percent price reduction for a $200-per-month self-serve customer saves them $20 and is unlikely to influence their behavior in any measurable way. The same dollar of savings creates dramatically different value depending on which customer segment receives it.

## The Timing Dimension

When you pass savings matters as much as whether you pass them. Three timing strategies exist, each with different effects.

**Immediate pass-through** — reducing prices within weeks of a cost reduction — signals responsiveness and customer alignment. It works best when the cost reduction is public and large, when competitors are likely to respond quickly, and when your customer contracts include cost-adjustment clauses that create an expectation of timely action. The risk is that you lock in lower prices before you understand the full financial impact of the cost change.

**Scheduled pass-through** — adjusting prices at the next contract renewal or at a predetermined review date — gives you time to model the impact, plan the communication, and combine the pass-through with other contract changes. This is the most common approach for enterprise accounts because it aligns with the existing contract rhythm and avoids mid-cycle disruptions. The risk is that the delay creates a perception gap — customers who know about the cost reduction but have not yet seen a price adjustment may feel they are being taken advantage of.

**Bundled pass-through** — combining cost savings with feature releases, quality improvements, or packaging changes — redirects the conversation from "you owe us a price cut" to "here is more value at a better price." Instead of reducing the per-query price by fifteen percent, you hold the price steady and add a new capability tier, increase the included volume, or improve the SLA at the same price point. The customer gets more value for the same spend, which often feels better than a small percentage discount. You retain the nominal price, which protects your pricing architecture from downward ratcheting.

## The Ratchet Problem

Every price reduction creates a new floor. Once you lower your price, raising it later — even if your costs increase — is extraordinarily difficult. Customers anchor to the lower price and treat any increase as a betrayal, regardless of the underlying cost dynamics. This is the **ratchet problem**: pass-through decisions ratchet your price downward over time, and there is no equivalent mechanism to ratchet it back up.

The ratchet problem means that pass-through decisions are not reversible. A forty percent cost reduction that you fully pass through as a forty percent price cut becomes your permanent pricing reality. If costs later increase by twenty percent, you cannot raise prices by twenty percent to compensate — you will face fierce customer resistance. Your effective margin in the new cost environment is now worse than it would have been if you had captured half the original savings as margin buffer.

This is why the partial pass-through model with a margin reserve is structurally superior to full pass-through. It accounts for the fact that AI costs are volatile in both directions. Model provider pricing in 2024 through 2026 has generally trended downward, which makes full pass-through feel correct in the moment. But model capabilities are also improving, which means the models you need to use to maintain competitive quality may be newer, more capable, and more expensive than the models you used when you set your current price. The transition from one model generation to the next almost always involves a period of higher per-token costs for equivalent capability, and that transition is your margin reserve's reason for existing.

## The Decision in Practice

Pull the four factors together into a repeatable decision process. When a cost reduction event occurs — a provider price cut, an internal optimization deployment, a model migration that lowers your cost-to-serve — run through the framework.

First, calculate the total cost savings in dollar terms. Not percentage terms. Dollar terms. A fifty percent price cut on a model that represents ten percent of your total cost-to-serve is a five percent total cost reduction, not a fifty percent savings. Denominate the savings in monthly dollars so the magnitude is concrete.

Second, compare your current gross margin to your target. If you are below target, the default is capture. If you are at or above target, the default is partial pass-through.

Third, assess competitive pressure. If a competitor has moved on pricing or is likely to move, increase the pass-through percentage. If the competitive environment is stable, maintain the default.

Fourth, check customer expectations. If the cost event is public and your customers are likely to know about it, plan proactive communication with partial pass-through. If the cost event is an internal optimization invisible to customers, capture the savings.

Fifth, time the pass-through. Match it to the next natural pricing event — contract renewal, annual price review, packaging update — unless competitive urgency demands faster action.

This process takes the emotion out of the decision and replaces it with a framework that balances financial discipline with competitive awareness. The CFO who follows this process will manage margins through cost volatility without overreacting to individual cost events or ignoring competitive realities.

Provider pricing is volatile. Cost levers change your math. Pass-through decisions shape your margin trajectory. But none of these individual decisions matter if you do not track the cumulative risk that provider dependency creates. The next subchapter introduces the Provider Dependency Risk Register — the document that makes every provider risk visible, quantified, and actionable before it becomes a crisis.
