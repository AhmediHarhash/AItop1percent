# 30.7.7 — The Board Deck: Presenting AI Unit Economics to Non-Technical Directors

Your board does not need to understand transformer architectures, inference optimization, or prompt engineering. Your board needs to answer one question every quarter: is this company building a durable, profitable business, or is it burning cash on technology that may never generate sustainable margins? Every slide in your board deck must serve that question. Every metric must translate from the language engineers speak into the language directors use to evaluate businesses. The gap between these two languages is where most AI companies lose their boards — not because the business is unhealthy, but because the story is told in the wrong vocabulary.

Board members at AI companies in 2026 typically fall into three categories. The first is the former operator — a director who ran a SaaS company or a technology division and understands software economics intuitively but has never managed a business where the cost of goods sold fluctuates by thirty percent quarter over quarter. The second is the financial director — someone from a venture capital firm, private equity background, or public company board who evaluates businesses through financial ratios and comparable company analysis but has no intuition for why AI gross margins behave differently from SaaS gross margins. The third is the domain expert — a director chosen for their industry knowledge in healthcare, financial services, or whatever vertical the company serves, who understands the customer deeply but may not understand software economics at all. Your board deck must work for all three simultaneously. The former operator needs to see familiar frameworks applied to unfamiliar cost structures. The financial director needs to see ratios they can benchmark against their portfolio. The domain expert needs to see the customer story in terms they recognize. Miss any one of these audiences and you lose a board member's confidence — which, over time, means losing their support when you need it most.

## The Five-Slide Framework

The board deck for an AI company should follow what effective CFOs call the **Five-Slide Framework** — not because the total deck is five slides, but because five specific slides carry the weight of the financial narrative. Everything else in the deck is supporting detail. If a director remembers nothing from the board meeting except what these five slides showed, they should still walk away understanding the health and trajectory of the business.

The five slides are: the margin trajectory slide, the unit economics by customer segment slide, the provider dependency and cost risk slide, the net dollar retention drivers slide, and the path to target margins slide. Each serves a different analytical need. Together, they tell a story that moves from "where are we now" through "what drives our economics" to "where are we going and how do we get there." The order matters because each slide builds on the previous one. A board member who sees the margin trajectory first has the context to evaluate the unit economics. A board member who sees the unit economics first has the context to understand the provider dependency risks. The sequence creates comprehension that individual slides in isolation cannot.

## Slide One: The Margin Trajectory

This is the most important slide in the deck. It answers the question every director asks first: are margins improving, stable, or deteriorating? The slide shows gross margin by quarter for the trailing eight quarters and the projected four quarters, with a clear visual of the trend.

The critical design choice is showing **reported gross margin** alongside **cost-adjusted gross margin** — the margin you would have if model provider pricing had remained constant. This distinction matters because a company whose reported gross margin improved from thirty-eight percent to fifty-one percent over four quarters may have achieved that improvement entirely through model provider price decreases rather than operational efficiency. If the provider price cuts stop — or reverse — the margin improvement evaporates. The cost-adjusted view separates the margin gains you earned through operational improvement, better routing, and pricing optimization from the margin gains that were given to you by the market.

Present both numbers, clearly labeled. "Reported gross margin: fifty-one percent. Cost-adjusted gross margin, excluding provider price changes: forty-six percent." The five-point gap tells the board that roughly one-third of the improvement came from external factors. This is not a bad story — external tailwinds are real and should be captured — but the board needs to know how much of the trajectory they can count on if the tailwinds stop.

Below the margin chart, include three to four bullet points naming the specific drivers of margin change in the quarter. "Routing optimization shifted 12 percent of traffic from frontier to mid-tier models, improving blended cost per request by 18 percent." "Renegotiated provider committed spend agreement, securing a 15 percent discount on volume above 50 million tokens per month." "Customer mix shifted toward enterprise segment, which carries 8 percentage points higher margin than mid-market." These are the operational details that the former operator on your board will evaluate, and they translate the margin number from a financial statistic into a story about management execution.

## Slide Two: Unit Economics by Customer Segment

Aggregate unit economics hide more than they reveal. A company with an average cost-to-serve of $1,200 per customer per month might have enterprise customers costing $8,000 per month and paying $22,000, mid-market customers costing $900 per month and paying $1,800, and startup customers costing $400 per month and paying $350. The aggregate tells you the business is fine. The segments tell you the startup tier is underwater and every new startup customer makes the business slightly worse.

This slide breaks unit economics into three to four customer segments — typically enterprise, mid-market, growth, and self-serve — and shows four metrics for each: average revenue per customer, average cost-to-serve per customer, gross margin per segment, and the segment's contribution to total gross profit. The presentation should make it immediately obvious which segments are the economic engine and which are the growth investments.

The power of this slide is that it connects pricing decisions to financial outcomes at a level directors can evaluate. When you say "we are considering raising prices on the self-serve tier by twenty percent," the slide shows that self-serve is currently margin-negative, that the price increase would bring it to breakeven, and that the segment represents only six percent of total revenue — so even if some customers churn, the net impact on aggregate margins is positive. The director does not need to understand why self-serve customers are margin-negative. They can see the math and evaluate the decision.

Include a quarter-over-quarter comparison for each segment so the board can see whether segment economics are improving or deteriorating. A stable enterprise margin with an improving mid-market margin tells a different story than a declining enterprise margin offset by improving mid-market economics. The former might mean your premium positioning is solid and your mid-market pricing is maturing. The latter might mean enterprise customers are pushing back on pricing and you are compensating by squeezing mid-market customers harder. Same aggregate trajectory. Very different strategic implications.

## Slide Three: Provider Dependency and Cost Risk

This slide answers the question that financially sophisticated directors ask every quarter in 2026: "What happens to our margins if our model provider raises prices, goes down, or changes terms?" It is the AI-specific equivalent of the concentration risk analysis that boards expect for customer concentration — but applied to the supply side.

Present four data points. First, the **provider concentration ratio**: what percentage of your total inference cost goes to your primary model provider? If the answer is eighty-two percent to a single provider, the board needs to know that. Second, the **cost sensitivity analysis**: if your primary provider raises prices by twenty percent, what happens to your gross margin? Show the specific impact: "A twenty percent price increase from our primary provider reduces gross margin by 7.4 percentage points, from fifty-one percent to forty-three point six percent." Third, the **migration readiness score**: how quickly could you shift traffic to an alternative provider? "We can redirect forty percent of traffic to alternative providers within seventy-two hours. Full migration requires four to six weeks." Fourth, the **committed spend exposure**: how much volume have you committed to purchase, and what happens if customer demand falls below that commitment? "We have committed to $180,000 per month in minimum spend. Current usage is at one hundred thirty-five percent of commitment. If usage drops below commitment, the excess cost reduces gross margin by 2.1 percentage points."

This slide serves two purposes. It demonstrates that management is actively monitoring and managing the company's most significant cost risk. And it gives directors the specific numbers they need to evaluate worst-case scenarios without asking management to produce ad hoc analyses between meetings. The director who worries about provider dependency walks out of the board meeting with the answer already in hand. That is the kind of preparation that builds board confidence over quarters and years.

## Slide Four: Net Dollar Retention Drivers

**Net dollar retention** — the percentage of last year's revenue that this year's existing customers generate, including expansion, contraction, and churn — is the single metric that most clearly communicates whether your product creates increasing or decreasing value over time. A net dollar retention of 115 percent means your existing customers are spending fifteen percent more this year than last year, even before you add new customers. A retention of eighty-five percent means your customer base is shrinking and you need to acquire enough new customers to fill the hole before you can grow.

The board does not just need the number. They need the decomposition. This slide breaks NDR into its four components: **gross retention** (what percentage of revenue you kept, before any expansion), **expansion revenue** (additional revenue from existing customers), **contraction** (reduced spending from existing customers who stayed), and **churn** (revenue lost from customers who left entirely). Each component has a percentage and a dollar value.

Gross retention of ninety-two percent means you lost eight percent of revenue from existing customers to contraction and churn combined. Expansion of twenty-three percent means existing customers who stayed increased their spending by twenty-three percent of the prior year's base. The net of these two — 92 percent minus 100 percent plus 23 percent — produces NDR of 115 percent. But the story is radically different depending on the composition. Is the eight percent loss concentrated in one large customer or spread across many small ones? Is the twenty-three percent expansion coming from organic usage growth or from price increases? Is the churn rate increasing quarter over quarter even though NDR is stable because expansion is masking it?

Name the top three drivers of each component. "Expansion driven by: customer X expanding to three new departments, contributing $140,000 in incremental annual revenue. Seven mid-market customers increasing usage by an average of 35 percent following product improvements in Q2. Price increase on self-serve tier adding $95,000 in annual revenue across 210 customers." "Churn driven by: customer Y moving to internal build after twelve months, representing $180,000 annual revenue. Three startup customers acquired by larger companies that have existing vendor relationships." This level of specificity transforms NDR from a ratio on a dashboard into a narrative about customer relationships that directors can interrogate and advise on.

## Slide Five: The Path to Target Margins

This is the slide that connects the present to the future. It shows the current gross margin, the target gross margin, the timeframe to reach it, and the specific initiatives that will close the gap. For most AI companies in 2026, the current gross margin sits between thirty-five and fifty-five percent. The target for investor credibility is sixty-five to seventy-five percent — the range that allows an AI company to be compared favorably to SaaS benchmarks, even if it never reaches the eighty to eighty-five percent margins of pure software.

Structure the slide as a bridge chart — a visual that starts at the current margin on the left, shows each improvement initiative as a step upward, and ends at the target margin on the right. Each step is labeled with the initiative name and the estimated margin impact. "Routing optimization, phase two: plus 4.2 percentage points. Provider renegotiation at committed spend renewal: plus 2.8 percentage points. Self-serve tier price increase: plus 1.1 percentage points. Customer mix shift toward enterprise: plus 2.4 percentage points. Fine-tuned model deployment for high-volume use cases: plus 3.1 percentage points." The sum of the steps should slightly exceed the gap between current and target margins, because not every initiative will deliver its full expected impact.

Each step should include a timeline — when the initiative starts, when it delivers margin impact, and when it reaches full run-rate. "Routing optimization begins Q2, delivers initial margin improvement in Q3, reaches full impact by Q1 next year." This timeline serves two purposes. It gives the board a sequence of expected improvements to track against in future meetings. And it demonstrates that the margin trajectory is not aspirational — it is the result of specific, planned work with owners, timelines, and measurable outcomes.

The path-to-target-margins slide is also where you address the question that skeptical directors will ask: "What if the improvements don't deliver?" Include a sensitivity line that shows the margin path if only sixty percent of the planned improvements materialize. If that sixty-percent scenario still shows meaningful margin improvement — say, from forty-five percent to fifty-eight percent instead of the target sixty-eight percent — the board has confidence that the trajectory is robust even if execution is imperfect. If the sixty-percent scenario shows stagnation, the board knows the plan is aggressive and may push for more conservative initiatives.

## Translating AI Concepts for Non-Technical Directors

Beyond the five core slides, every board deck for an AI company must translate the technical concepts that drive financial outcomes into language that non-technical directors can evaluate without a tutorial.

**Cost-to-serve** becomes "what it costs us to deliver the product to each customer." Not inference cost, not token cost, not GPU utilization — the fully loaded cost of serving one customer for one month. When you explain that cost-to-serve dropped by twelve percent, you are telling the board that your operations became more efficient. The mechanism — routing optimization, model selection, caching — belongs in the appendix, not the main deck.

**Model cost volatility** becomes "how much our supplier costs can change." Directors understand supplier risk in any industry. The meat supplier that raises prices. The chip manufacturer that faces a shortage. Model provider cost volatility is the same concept — your primary input cost can move by twenty percent or more based on decisions your supplier makes. Framing it this way gives directors a mental model they already have.

**Usage-based revenue** becomes "customers pay based on how much they use, like a utility." The utility analogy is imperfect but powerful because every director understands it. Electricity usage varies by season. Water usage varies by weather. AI usage varies by business cycle. The financial implications — seasonal revenue, unpredictable consumption, the need for demand forecasting — follow naturally from the analogy.

**The inference cost curve** becomes "our suppliers keep getting cheaper, and we capture part of that savings." Directors do not need to know about Moore's Law, GPU generations, or model distillation. They need to know that the cost of your primary input is declining over time, that you capture some of that decline as margin improvement, and that you pass some of it to customers as price competitiveness. The ratio between capture and pass-through is a strategic decision the board can evaluate.

## The Appendix: Technical Depth for the Directors Who Want It

Every board has at least one director who wants to go deeper. The former CTO. The venture partner who invests exclusively in AI. The industry expert who has been reading about model architectures and has questions. The appendix is where you serve this audience without slowing down the main presentation.

The appendix should include model provider cost detail by provider and model tier, showing the actual rates you pay and how they compare to list pricing. It should include routing distribution data showing what percentage of traffic goes to each model and how that distribution has changed over time. It should include quality metrics — evaluation scores, error rates, customer satisfaction data — that demonstrate the product is maintaining or improving quality even as costs decrease. And it should include a competitive landscape update showing how your pricing compares to alternatives and how that positioning has shifted.

The rule for the appendix is: no slide in the appendix should be presented during the main meeting unless a director asks a question that requires it. The main deck tells the story. The appendix provides the evidence for directors who want to verify the story's claims. Having the appendix ready but not presenting it proactively signals confidence — you have the data, you are prepared for scrutiny, and you respect the board's time enough not to drown them in technical detail unless they ask for it.

## The Quarterly Rhythm: Building Board Fluency Over Time

Board fluency with AI economics is not built in a single meeting. It is built over quarters. The first board deck in this format will require extra time for explanation — what the metrics mean, why they matter, why AI economics differ from SaaS. By the third quarter, the definitions are established and the conversation shifts from "what does this metric mean" to "why did this metric change." By the fourth quarter, directors start asking the right questions unprompted: "I see cost-to-serve dropped but gross margin only improved slightly — are we passing too much savings to customers?" That question is worth more than any slide because it means the director understands the business well enough to challenge management's decisions with specificity.

Accelerate this fluency by being consistent. Use the same metrics in the same format every quarter. Define terms once in a glossary slide and reference it as needed, but do not change the definitions. If you change a metric — say, moving from simple gross margin to contribution margin — explain why, show the old metric alongside the new one for two quarters, then retire the old metric. Board members who see shifting definitions lose trust because they cannot tell whether the business improved or the measurement changed.

Send a pre-read forty-eight hours before the board meeting. The pre-read should include the five core slides with brief written commentary explaining the quarter's key themes. Directors who read the pre-read arrive at the meeting ready to ask questions rather than spending the first thirty minutes absorbing information. Directors who do not read the pre-read still get the full presentation in the meeting. Either way, the forty-eight-hour window signals that you respect their preparation time and expect them to come informed.

## When the Numbers Are Bad

The hardest board deck is the one where the numbers moved in the wrong direction. Margins contracted. A large customer churned. Usage declined across a segment. The temptation is to bury the bad news in the middle of the deck, surround it with positive context, and hope the board focuses on the brighter spots. This approach fails because sophisticated directors see the deflection and lose trust — which is worse than the bad number itself.

Lead with the bad news. Put it on the first slide after the executive summary. "Gross margin declined 3.2 percentage points this quarter, from forty-eight percent to forty-four point eight percent. The decline was driven by two factors: a model provider price increase that added $47,000 in monthly COGS, and a shift in customer mix toward a high-volume, lower-margin segment." Then immediately follow with what you are doing about it. "We are renegotiating the provider agreement with a competing bid from an alternative provider. We are implementing tiered pricing for the high-volume segment that recovers margin without increasing churn risk. Expected margin recovery: two to three percentage points by Q3."

Directors respect transparency because it gives them something useful to do. A board that hears bad news clearly can advise, connect you with resources, or provide strategic guidance. A board that suspects bad news is being hidden starts asking pointed questions, requesting additional data, and micromanaging decisions — all of which consume management time and erode the trust that makes board relationships productive.

The CFO who presents the bad quarter honestly and with a clear recovery plan builds more board capital than the CFO who presents three good quarters in a row by obscuring the details. Capital built through transparency compounds. Capital built through optimism collapses the moment reality intrudes.

## The Board Deck as Operating Discipline

The board deck is not just a communication tool. It is an operating discipline that forces your finance team, your product team, and your leadership to align on the metrics that matter, the story those metrics tell, and the actions required to improve them. The quarterly rhythm of producing the five core slides creates accountability: someone owns margin trajectory, someone owns unit economics by segment, someone owns provider dependency tracking, someone owns NDR decomposition, and someone owns the path-to-target-margins plan.

Companies that treat the board deck as a compliance obligation — something to assemble the week before the meeting — miss this benefit. Companies that treat it as a management operating system — a quarterly forcing function that aligns the leadership team around the financial narrative — discover that the board deck improves their business even if no director ever reads it. The act of building the slides surfaces the questions that matter. The act of defending the numbers in a board meeting sharpens the team's understanding of their own business. The act of tracking quarter over quarter whether the path-to-target-margins is on track or off track creates the operational focus that actually delivers the margins.

This is the real value of the board deck. Not the slides. Not the presentation. The discipline of knowing your own numbers well enough to explain them to someone who does not share your technical vocabulary. The next subchapter takes this discipline into the fundraising conversation — where the same story must be told with even more precision, because the audience is not advising you. They are deciding whether to write a check.
