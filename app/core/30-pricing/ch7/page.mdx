# Chapter 7 — Financial Metrics, Reporting, and Investor Readiness

AI companies are held to the same financial benchmarks that defined SaaS for two decades — gross margin, LTV-to-CAC ratio, net dollar retention, the Rule of 40 — but the underlying economics make every one of these metrics harder to achieve and harder to predict. Gross margins start lower because compute is a real cost. LTV-to-CAC is harder to calculate because customer lifetime is uncertain when AI performance can degrade. Net dollar retention depends on usage expansion that you cannot fully control. Revenue forecasting requires models that account for variable costs, usage volatility, and model provider price changes that can happen quarterly. This chapter teaches the financial language of AI businesses — what the metrics mean when applied to variable-cost products, how to report them honestly without hiding structural challenges, and how to present the margin trajectory story that satisfies investors, boards, and public markets.

*The market no longer funds AI on promise alone. Investors, boards, and public markets want to see a clear path from current margins to sustainable profitability — and the companies that cannot tell that story do not get their next round.*
