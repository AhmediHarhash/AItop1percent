# 30.7.5 — Revenue Recognition for Usage-Based and Outcome-Based Models

The controller stares at the spreadsheet and cannot close the books. The company sells an AI-powered contract analysis product on a usage-based model — customers pay per document analyzed. One enterprise customer prepaid $480,000 in credits at the start of the year but has only consumed $127,000 worth by the end of Q1. Another customer signed an outcome-based deal where they pay only when the AI identifies a contract clause that saves them money — three outcomes were delivered in March, but the customer disputes one of them. A third customer is on a hybrid plan: a $6,000 monthly platform fee plus per-document charges that vary from $800 to $14,000 per month depending on deal flow. The controller needs to produce a revenue number for the quarter. She has three pricing models, three different recognition patterns, and an auditor arriving Monday. Welcome to AI revenue recognition in 2026.

Traditional SaaS made revenue recognition straightforward. A customer pays $120,000 per year for a seat-based license. You recognize $10,000 per month, evenly, over the contract period. The performance obligation is clear: provide access to the software. The timing is clear: ratably over the subscription term. The amount is clear: the contract price divided by twelve. Auditors love it. CFOs love it. Boards understand it. AI products broke every one of those simplicities. Usage-based pricing means the total contract value is unknown at signing. Outcome-based pricing means revenue depends on events that may or may not occur. Prepaid credits mean cash is in the bank but cannot be called revenue until the customer actually uses the product. Each model creates a different accounting challenge under ASC 606, and getting it wrong does not just produce an audit finding — it can trigger restatements, delay fundraising, and destroy investor confidence at the worst possible moment.

## The Five-Step Framework Applied to AI Products

**ASC 606** is the revenue recognition standard that governs how companies in the United States recognize revenue from contracts with customers. The international equivalent is IFRS 15, which follows substantially similar principles. Both standards use a five-step model: identify the contract, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations, and recognize revenue when each obligation is satisfied. For traditional SaaS, these steps are almost mechanical. For AI products, each step introduces ambiguity that requires judgment.

Step one — identify the contract — is usually straightforward. You have a signed agreement with defined terms. But AI products increasingly use terms-of-service agreements with no committed volume, which raises questions about whether a contract even exists under ASC 606 until the customer actually places an order or consumes a unit. If there is no minimum commitment, you may not have a contract to recognize until consumption occurs.

Step two — identify the performance obligations — is where AI gets complicated. Is the AI analysis a single obligation, or does the ongoing model improvement constitute a separate obligation? If your product includes both real-time AI processing and a monthly insights dashboard generated from accumulated data, are those one obligation or two? The answer matters because it determines how you allocate revenue. Most AI companies treat their product as a single, integrated performance obligation — the AI processing and any associated features are inseparable because the customer cannot benefit from one without the other. This is usually the defensible position, but you need documentation explaining why the components are not distinct.

Step three — determine the transaction price — is where usage-based and outcome-based models diverge from traditional SaaS entirely.

## Usage-Based Revenue: The Right-to-Invoice Approach

For pure usage-based AI products — where the customer pays per query, per document, per analysis, or per token — revenue recognition follows a pattern that accountants call the **right-to-invoice practical expedient**. This expedient, codified in ASC 606, allows you to recognize revenue in the amount you have the right to invoice when two conditions are met: the amount you invoice corresponds directly with the value of the performance transferred to the customer, and the entity's efforts to transfer the performance are roughly evenly distributed over time or the entity recognizes revenue in the amount it bills.

In practice, this means you recognize revenue as consumption occurs. A customer who runs 500 document analyses at $12 each in March generates $6,000 of recognized revenue in March. No estimation required. No constraint analysis needed. The consumption happened, the value was delivered, and the invoice corresponds directly to the units consumed. This is the cleanest form of AI revenue recognition and the one that creates the fewest audit issues.

The simplicity breaks down with volume commitments and tiered pricing. If a customer commits to a minimum of 10,000 queries per month at $0.08 per query but actually uses only 6,000, you still have the right to invoice for 10,000. The revenue is $800 per month regardless of consumption because the contract creates a minimum obligation. But now you have a customer paying for unused capacity, and the question becomes whether the $200 per month of unused capacity is recognized as revenue or deferred. Under ASC 606, if the minimum commitment is a non-refundable fee for standing ready to deliver the service, you recognize the full minimum as revenue each month. If the unused capacity rolls forward as credits, you have a different accounting treatment entirely.

Tiered pricing creates similar complications. A customer paying $0.10 per query for the first 5,000 and $0.07 per query above that threshold has a blended rate that changes throughout the billing period. If you recognize revenue as queries occur, the early queries are recognized at a higher rate than the later ones. This is acceptable under the right-to-invoice expedient as long as you are billing per the contractual tiers. But some companies prefer to estimate total monthly volume and apply a blended rate from the start of the period for smoother revenue curves. Both approaches are defensible. The key is consistency — pick one, document why, and apply it uniformly.

## Prepaid Credits and the Deferred Revenue Problem

Prepaid credits are one of the most popular pricing mechanisms for AI products in 2026, and they create one of the most common revenue recognition mistakes. When a customer pays $240,000 upfront for a credit balance that they draw down as they use your product, the temptation is to treat that payment as revenue. It is not. It is **deferred revenue** — a liability on your balance sheet that represents your obligation to deliver future service.

The cash hits your bank account on day one. The revenue hits your income statement only as the customer consumes credits. If the customer spends $60,000 in credits during Q1, you recognize $60,000 in revenue and carry $180,000 as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. This is not optional accounting conservatism. It is the required treatment under ASC 606 because you have not yet satisfied the performance obligation for the unconsumed credits.

The complication arises with credit expiration. Many AI products sell credits that expire after twelve months. If a customer buys $240,000 in credits and only uses $180,000 before expiration, what happens to the remaining $60,000? Under ASC 606, you recognize the expired credits as revenue when you can make a reasonable estimate that the customer will not use them — a concept called **breakage**. If your historical data shows that customers with similar usage patterns typically leave fifteen to twenty percent of credits unused, you can begin recognizing a proportionate share of expected breakage revenue over the life of the credit package, rather than waiting until the credits actually expire. This accelerates revenue recognition but requires robust data to support the breakage estimate. An auditor will ask you to demonstrate that your breakage rates are statistically reliable, that the customer population is large enough to make the estimate meaningful, and that you update the estimate quarterly.

The second complication is credit refundability. If your contract allows customers to receive refunds on unused credits, you cannot recognize breakage revenue at all because the unused credits are not certain to convert to revenue — the customer might request a refund instead. Non-refundable credits with expiration dates are the cleanest structure for revenue recognition. Refundable credits with no expiration are the worst — they remain as deferred revenue on your balance sheet indefinitely, depressing your recognized revenue and inflating your liabilities.

## Outcome-Based Revenue: When Payment Depends on Results

**Outcome-based pricing** — where the customer pays only when the AI delivers a measurable result — is the most aggressive pricing model in AI and the most challenging from a revenue recognition perspective. Under ASC 606, outcome-based payments are classified as **variable consideration** because the total amount depends on uncertain future events.

Variable consideration requires you to estimate the expected revenue using one of two methods: the **expected value method**, which calculates a probability-weighted average of possible outcomes, or the **most likely amount method**, which uses the single most likely outcome. For AI products with a large number of similar outcomes — an AI that processes thousands of documents per month and gets paid for each one that meets a quality threshold — the expected value method is typically more appropriate because it averages across a wide distribution. For AI products with binary outcomes — the AI either wins the deal or it does not, the AI either identifies the fraud or it does not — the most likely amount method is usually more appropriate.

But estimation is only half the challenge. ASC 606 also requires you to apply a **constraint** to variable consideration. The constraint says you can only include variable consideration in your transaction price to the extent that it is probable a significant revenue reversal will not occur. "Probable" under US GAAP means "likely to occur" — a higher bar than "more likely than not." In practice, this means you cannot recognize outcome-based revenue until you are confident the outcome has been delivered and will not be reversed.

For the contract analysis company from the opening scenario, the outcome where the customer disputes a result illustrates the constraint in action. Even though three outcomes were delivered in March, the disputed outcome cannot be recognized as revenue until the dispute is resolved. If disputes are common — say, ten to fifteen percent of outcomes are challenged — the constraint may require you to defer a portion of all outcome-based revenue to account for the expected dispute rate, even for outcomes that have not been individually challenged.

The practical consequence is that outcome-based AI products show lower recognized revenue than their actual delivered value in any given quarter. This is not a reporting failure — it is the constraint working as designed, preventing revenue overstatement. But it creates a gap between what the business feels like it earned and what the financial statements show. Your board needs to understand this gap, your investors need to see it explained clearly, and your FP&A team needs to forecast recognized revenue separately from delivered value.

## Hybrid Models: The Recognition Puzzle

Most AI companies in 2026 do not use a pure pricing model. They combine elements — a monthly platform fee, per-unit usage charges, and outcome-based bonuses — into a single contract. These **hybrid contracts** are the hardest to account for under ASC 606 because each component may follow a different recognition pattern.

Consider a contract with three pricing components. First, a $5,000 monthly platform fee that grants access to the AI system and its dashboards. Second, a per-document analysis charge of $15 per document. Third, a success fee of $500 for each analysis that identifies a material contract risk the customer confirms as valid.

The platform fee is recognized ratably — $5,000 per month over the contract term. The per-document charge is recognized as documents are processed under the right-to-invoice expedient. The success fee is variable consideration subject to the constraint, recognized only when the outcome is delivered and confirmed. Same contract, three recognition patterns, three different timing profiles.

The allocation challenge becomes acute when the pricing components are not clearly separable. If the per-document charge is set below the standalone selling price because the success fee is expected to compensate, you need to allocate the total transaction price across all three performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. This allocation affects how much revenue is recognized from each component and when. Getting the allocation wrong can shift revenue between quarters — which, in a startup racing toward growth metrics that unlock the next funding round, can be the difference between hitting and missing the number that matters.

## The Audit Trail Imperative

Revenue recognition for AI products is not just an accounting exercise. It is a data infrastructure problem. Your billing system must track consumption at a granularity that maps to your performance obligations. Your product must emit events that correspond to the units your contracts charge for. And your finance team must be able to trace every dollar of recognized revenue back to a specific product event — a document processed, a query answered, an outcome delivered.

The companies that struggle with AI revenue recognition are almost always the ones that built their billing systems around invoicing rather than around event tracking. They can tell you what they billed a customer. They cannot tell you, at the unit level, which product events generated that bill. When the auditor asks why $47,000 was recognized in March for a specific customer, the answer needs to be traceable to specific document analyses, specific query counts, or specific confirmed outcomes — not to a manual spreadsheet that someone in finance populated from memory.

Build the event-level tracking before you need it. Connect your product telemetry to your billing system so that every consumption event is logged with a timestamp, a customer identifier, a unit type, and a unit value. Build the reconciliation reports that match product events to billing records to recognized revenue. This infrastructure is not just an audit defense — it is the foundation that makes every financial metric in this chapter trustable. Without it, your revenue numbers are estimates. With it, they are provable.

## Revenue Recognition as Strategic Communication

The mechanics of revenue recognition are accounting requirements. But how you communicate your revenue is a strategic choice that shapes how investors, board members, and potential acquirers perceive your business.

A company with $8 million in booked contracts but only $5.2 million in recognized revenue because of deferred credits and constrained outcome fees looks like a $5.2 million business on the income statement. But it is really an $8 million business in terms of customer commitment. The gap between bookings and recognized revenue is not a problem to hide — it is a story to tell. High deferred revenue means customers are committing capital upfront, which signals confidence. The constraint on outcome-based revenue means you are being conservative in recognition, which signals financial discipline. Both of these narratives are positive when framed correctly.

The opposite is also true. A company that aggressively recognizes revenue — taking credit for outcome-based payments before outcomes are confirmed, recognizing breakage revenue without statistical support, or treating refundable credits as non-refundable — creates a recognized revenue number that looks better today but creates restatement risk tomorrow. Aggressive recognition is not a growth strategy. It is a ticking audit finding that will surface at exactly the wrong moment: during a fundraise, an acquisition due diligence, or a public offering preparation.

The disciplined approach is to recognize conservatively, report the gap between bookings and recognized revenue transparently, and use the deferred revenue balance as a leading indicator of future recognized revenue. Investors who understand SaaS already use deferred revenue as a forward-looking metric. Teach them to apply the same lens to your AI business, and the conservative recognition pattern becomes a credibility asset rather than a growth headwind.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

The first and most common mistake is treating prepaid credits as revenue at the time of payment. This happens most often in early-stage companies that have not yet engaged an auditor and are reporting financials internally without ASC 606 discipline. The fix is simple but requires infrastructure: implement deferred revenue accounting from day one, even if you are pre-audit. The cost of retrofitting revenue recognition is an order of magnitude higher than implementing it correctly from the start.

The second mistake is failing to apply the variable consideration constraint to outcome-based revenue. Companies that sell on outcomes often recognize the full outcome fee at the point of delivery without accounting for dispute rates, reversal rates, or clawback provisions. If your historical data shows that eight percent of outcomes are disputed and three percent are ultimately reversed, you need to constrain your recognized revenue by at least that percentage until disputes are resolved.

The third mistake is inconsistent application of recognition policies across customer segments. If your enterprise customers are on annual prepaid credits and your mid-market customers are on monthly usage billing, you may have two different recognition patterns that are both correct — but only if you have documented the policy for each and applied it consistently. Mixing approaches without documentation is an audit finding. Having two documented approaches applied consistently is clean.

The fourth mistake is ignoring the impact of free tiers and trial credits on revenue recognition. If your free tier generates product events that are identical to paid events — the same document analyses, the same query processing — you need to ensure your billing system distinguishes between free and paid consumption. Free usage is not revenue, it is a marketing cost. But if free usage converts to paid usage in the same billing period, you need clean breakpoints in your event data to separate the two.

Revenue recognition is not the most exciting topic in AI product economics. But it is the foundation on which every financial metric in this chapter rests. Get it wrong and your gross margin calculation is built on unreliable revenue, your LTV is inflated, your NDR is misleading, and your board deck tells a story that your auditor will eventually contradict. Get it right, and you have a financial foundation that supports confident forecasting, clean fundraising, and the kind of precise financial communication that distinguishes serious companies from the ones still figuring out their own numbers.

Revenue recognition tells you where you have been. The next subchapter tackles the harder question: where you are going. Financial forecasting for AI companies is uniquely difficult because both the revenue and the cost side carry uncertainty that traditional SaaS models never had to handle.
