# Chapter 6 — Model Provider Economics and Cost Volatility

Your gross margin is built on someone else's pricing decisions. When OpenAI cuts GPT-5 pricing by 40 percent, your premium over raw API access compresses. When Anthropic raises Claude Opus rates for high-volume customers, your cost-to-serve jumps overnight. When Meta releases a new open-weight Llama model that matches proprietary performance on your use case, every enterprise buyer recalculates whether they need you at all. Model provider economics is not an infrastructure concern you delegate to engineering — it is a pricing concern that determines whether your business model survives the next twelve months. This chapter teaches the provider landscape, the cost levers that change your pricing math, the multi-provider negotiation strategy, and the competitive dynamics of a market where the floor keeps dropping.

*You do not control the cost of your most important input. Understanding model provider economics is not optional — it is the foundation your entire pricing strategy sits on, and it shifts every quarter.*
