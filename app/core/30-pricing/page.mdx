# Section 30 — Pricing, Packaging, and Unit Economics

Your AI product works. The models are fine-tuned, the evals pass, the infrastructure scales. Now comes the question that determines whether you have a business or a science project: how do you charge for it? In traditional SaaS, pricing was an afterthought — set a per-seat number, build annual contracts, enjoy 85 percent gross margins because every additional user costs you almost nothing to serve. AI demolishes that model. Every query you serve has a real compute cost. Every customer has a different cost-to-serve based on how they use the product. Your underlying model provider can change their pricing with thirty days notice and restructure your entire margin profile. The zero-marginal-cost assumption that made SaaS pricing simple no longer holds, and the companies that price AI products like traditional software are bleeding margin every month without understanding why.

This section teaches pricing as a strategic discipline — not a number on a website. You will learn the full cost stack from token inference to gross profit, the pricing models that work and the ones that quietly destroy value, the packaging structures that create expansion revenue, the enterprise contract mechanics that protect both sides, the model provider economics that determine your margin floor, the financial metrics that investors and boards actually care about, and the operational infrastructure that turns pricing from a one-time decision into a data-driven capability. The conceptual spine of the entire section is the AI Pricing Stack — a seven-layer framework that structures every pricing decision from cost floor to renewal strategy.

- **Chapter 1 — Why AI Pricing Is a Different Discipline** establishes the foundational reality: AI breaks the zero-marginal-cost assumption, introduces the four pricing models competing for dominance in 2026, frames the LLMflation Paradox where costs fall but spending rises, and introduces the AI Pricing Stack that structures every decision in this section.

- **Chapter 2 — The AI Margin Stack: From Token Cost to Gross Profit** dissects the full cost of serving an AI query, teaches per-customer cost-to-serve analysis, confronts the Heavy User Problem, and builds the margin engineering discipline that moves your product from 50 percent gross margins toward 70 percent without raising prices.

- **Chapter 3 — Pricing Models: Seats, Tokens, Outcomes, and Hybrids** examines every pricing model in detail — per-seat, consumption, outcome-based, and hybrid — with real company cases, economic trade-offs, and the practical decision framework for choosing your charge metric.

- **Chapter 4 — Packaging, Tiering, and the Feature Gate** teaches tier design that creates expansion pressure, feature gating strategy for AI products where free users cost real money, enterprise versus self-serve packaging, and the bundling decision between AI as a feature, AI as a product, and AI as a platform.

- **Chapter 5 — Enterprise Contracts, SLAs, and the Negotiation** covers the contract mechanics specific to AI — quality SLAs for probabilistic systems, volume commitments, discount strategy, procurement survival, and the politically charged challenge of pricing AI that replaces people.

- **Chapter 6 — Model Provider Economics and Cost Volatility** addresses the structural reality that your margin is built on someone else's API pricing — covering the provider landscape, multi-provider strategy, open-source economics, the commoditization spiral, and the build-versus-buy benchmark that every enterprise buyer uses against you.

- **Chapter 7 — Financial Metrics, Reporting, and Investor Readiness** teaches the financial language of AI businesses — gross margin as the battleground, net dollar retention as the lifeline, LTV-to-CAC for variable-cost products, revenue forecasting under uncertainty, and how to present AI unit economics to boards and investors.

- **Chapter 8 — Pricing Operations and Evolution** builds the operational infrastructure — billing systems for usage metering, radical transparency that makes consumption pricing survivable, competitive intelligence, pricing governance, international strategy, and the AI Pricing Maturity Model that takes you from guesswork to data-driven revenue optimization.

*Section 24 taught you how to engineer your costs down. Section 25 taught you how to balance cost against quality. This section teaches you how to turn that optimized cost structure into a pricing strategy that captures the value you create, builds a profitable business, and survives the volatility that makes AI economics fundamentally different from anything software has seen before.*
