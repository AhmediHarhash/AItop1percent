# 30.1.6 — What Adjacent Sections Cover and What This Section Does Not

Why does a book with an entire section on cost engineering need a separate section on pricing? Because cost and price are not the same thing, and the teams that confuse them build products that are either unprofitable or unsellable. The difference sounds obvious when stated plainly, yet the confusion persists in practice. Cost asks: what does it take to deliver this? Price asks: what should we charge for it? One is an engineering question. The other is a business strategy question. They interact, they constrain each other, and they share data — but they are different disciplines with different stakeholders, different metrics, and different failure modes.

This subchapter draws the boundaries. If you are reading Section 30 in sequence, this is your map. If you landed here from a cross-reference, this tells you where to go next.

## Section 24: The Cost Engineering Foundation

Section 24 — System Cost Engineering — is where you learn to reduce the dollar cost of serving AI. It covers the full mechanics of inference cost optimization: token compression, prompt caching, semantic caching, request batching, model quantization, KV-cache management, and the operational discipline of measuring cost-per-query at every layer of your stack. If your question is "how do I make this cheaper to run," the answer lives in Section 24.

The distinction matters because cost engineering is a prerequisite for pricing, not a substitute for it. You cannot set a sustainable price if you do not know your cost floor — and your cost floor is not a guess or a rough estimate. It is a precise, per-query, per-customer, per-feature measurement that accounts for input tokens, output tokens, model selection, retrieval overhead, embedding generation, re-ranking costs, and infrastructure amortization. Section 24 teaches you how to measure all of this and how to reduce it systematically. The cost floor it produces becomes the first layer of the AI Pricing Stack that structures every pricing decision in this section.

A common failure pattern is teams that skip cost engineering and jump straight to pricing. They set a price based on competitive benchmarks or buyer research, discover six months later that their cost-to-serve exceeds their price on 30 percent of their customer base, and scramble to either raise prices — alienating customers — or cut costs — degrading quality. Section 24 prevents this by giving you the operational machinery to know your true cost before you ever set a price.

## Section 25: The Cost-Quality Tradeoff

Section 25 — Cost-Quality Tradeoffs — addresses the strategic question that sits between cost engineering and pricing: how do you balance reducing cost against maintaining or improving quality? This is where you learn about model routing strategies that send simple queries to cheaper models and complex queries to expensive ones. It covers the decision framework for when to use a $0.15 per million token model versus a $10 per million token model versus a $120 per million token frontier model for the same product. It teaches you how to measure the quality impact of cost-cutting decisions and how to find the Pareto frontier where you get the most quality per dollar.

The relationship between Section 25 and Section 30 is direct. The cost-quality tradeoff determines your margin structure, and your margin structure constrains your pricing options. If your product requires a frontier model for every query to meet quality standards, your cost floor is high, your margin is thin at competitive prices, and your pricing strategy must either command premium pricing through differentiated value or find creative packaging that subsidizes expensive queries with cheaper ones. If your product can route 80 percent of queries to commodity models and only 20 percent to frontier models, your blended cost is dramatically lower, your margin is healthier, and you have more room to compete on price without destroying profitability.

Section 25 gives you the tools to make this decision. Section 30 tells you what to do with it.

## Section 28: Per-Customer Cost Attribution

Section 28, Chapter 7 covers per-customer evaluation cost attribution in multi-tenant environments. This is the operational infrastructure for knowing what each customer costs you to serve — not as an average across your customer base, but as a specific measurement for each account. Customer A sends 50,000 simple queries per month that route to commodity models. Customer B sends 8,000 complex queries per month that require frontier models and multi-step reasoning chains. Customer A's cost-to-serve is $47 per month. Customer B's cost-to-serve is $2,300 per month. If both customers pay the same flat subscription, you are subsidizing Customer B with Customer A's margin.

This per-customer cost visibility is essential for pricing strategy, particularly for enterprise deals with negotiated contracts. Section 28 teaches you how to build the attribution infrastructure. Section 30 teaches you how to use that attribution data to set prices, structure tiers, negotiate enterprise contracts, and identify accounts where you are systematically undercharging relative to the value and cost of service.

## Section 29: Governance and Compliance Constraints

Section 29 — Enterprise Governance, Org Design, and Compliance — covers the organizational and regulatory frameworks that constrain what you can charge and how you can charge it. The EU AI Act imposes transparency requirements on AI systems that affect how you disclose pricing to enterprise buyers in regulated industries. GDPR and data residency requirements create cost variations by geography — serving a European customer from EU-hosted infrastructure costs more than serving them from US-hosted infrastructure, and your pricing may need to reflect that or absorb it. SOX compliance requirements for publicly traded buyers create audit and documentation demands that increase your cost of enterprise sales. Healthcare and financial services regulations create approval workflows, data handling requirements, and risk assessment obligations that affect both your cost-to-serve and your buyer's willingness to pay.

Section 29 teaches you how to build governance programs. Section 30 teaches you how to account for regulatory costs and compliance requirements in your pricing and packaging, particularly through the sixth layer of the AI Pricing Stack — the Contractual Risk Adjustment — which captures the cost of regulatory compliance, indemnification, and liability provisions that enterprise contracts demand.

## Section 9: Model Selection and Its Pricing Implications

Section 9 — Model Selection and Routing — covers how to choose the right model for a given task and how to build routing logic that sends different queries to different models based on complexity, cost, and quality requirements. The model selection decision has direct pricing implications because your model choices determine your cost structure, your quality ceiling, and your competitive positioning.

If you select a single frontier model for all queries, your cost floor is high but your quality is consistently excellent. If you build a routing layer that distributes queries across a portfolio of models — from sub-cent open-source models for simple tasks to premium frontier models for complex ones — your blended cost is lower but your quality is variable, and your pricing needs to account for that variability. Section 9 teaches you how to build the model selection and routing infrastructure. Section 30 teaches you how to translate those routing decisions into pricing tiers, packaging bundles, and margin structures.

## What Section 30 Covers

With those boundaries clear, here is what this section does cover — and only this section covers.

Section 30 is about the revenue side of your AI business. It asks: how do you turn your AI capabilities into a pricing model, packaging structure, and unit economics framework that builds a profitable, growing, durable business? The core questions are: What pricing model should you use — per-seat, consumption, outcome-based, or hybrid? How do you package features and capabilities into tiers that align with buyer segments? What should your unit economics look like — cost-per-query, margin-per-customer, lifetime value-to-acquisition cost ratios? How do you handle enterprise contract negotiations where the buyer demands custom pricing, committed spend discounts, and outcome guarantees? How do you build pricing that survives the 10x annual deflation in inference costs? How do you price when 42 percent of companies are abandoning most AI initiatives and buyers demand proof of value before committing?

The AI Pricing Stack provides the structural framework. Its seven layers — Cost Floor, Margin Target, Value Capture Ceiling, Competitive Anchor, Buyer Budget Constraint, Contractual Risk Adjustment, and Renewal Expansion Strategy — organize every pricing decision from the bottom up. The cost floor comes from Section 24. The cost-quality tradeoff comes from Section 25. The per-customer attribution comes from Section 28. The governance constraints come from Section 29. The model selection implications come from Section 9. But the pricing strategy — how to set, package, negotiate, and evolve your prices — lives here in Section 30.

## The Core Distinction

If the relationship between these sections still feels blurry, here is the sharpest way to draw the line. Section 24 asks: how do we reduce cost? Section 25 asks: how do we balance cost and quality? Section 28 asks: how do we attribute cost to each customer? Section 29 asks: what governance constraints affect our business? Section 9 asks: which models do we use and when? Section 30 asks: how do we price what we sell?

Every other section optimizes the denominator — cost per unit of value delivered. This section optimizes the numerator — revenue per unit of value sold. Both matter. Neither is sufficient alone. A company with brilliant cost engineering and terrible pricing leaves money on the table. A company with brilliant pricing and terrible cost engineering burns money on every transaction. The goal is to be excellent at both, and to connect them through a pricing architecture that is as rigorous, measured, and systematically optimized as your inference pipeline.

The next subchapter addresses the force that makes pricing strategy more urgent than it has ever been: the 2026 renewal crisis, where enterprises that bought AI on promise in 2024 and 2025 are now demanding proof of value before they write the next check.
