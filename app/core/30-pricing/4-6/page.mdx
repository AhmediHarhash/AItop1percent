# 30.4.6 — Add-Ons, Modules, and the Expansion Revenue Engine

Net dollar retention above 100 percent means your existing customers spend more this year than last year, even accounting for churn. It is the single metric that separates AI companies that compound from AI companies that churn-and-replace. And the most reliable mechanical driver of net dollar retention is not price increases, not seat growth, not usage creep. It is the **add-on catalog** — a structured set of optional modules that let customers buy more value without changing their base plan, without renegotiating their contract, and without feeling like they are being upsold on something they should already have.

The difference between a well-designed add-on strategy and a poorly designed one is the difference between a customer who eagerly purchases more and a customer who feels nickel-and-dimed. One drives expansion revenue and loyalty. The other drives resentment and churn. The design principles are specific, the mistakes are predictable, and the revenue impact is enormous.

## Why Add-Ons Beat Price Increases for Expansion

There are three ways to grow revenue from an existing customer: raise the price, increase the volume, or sell them something new. Price increases are the bluntest instrument — they require a justification the customer finds credible, they create a natural moment for the customer to reevaluate whether your product is worth it, and they generate friction even when the increase is small. Volume growth — more seats, more usage — is organic and welcome, but it depends on the customer's own growth and adoption trajectory, which you only partially control.

Add-ons are the sharpest instrument because they decouple expansion from price changes and from the customer's organic growth. A customer who is not hiring new employees and not increasing usage can still spend more with you if you offer a module that solves a new problem or delivers incremental capability they did not have before. The purchasing decision is not "do I pay more for what I already have" — it is "do I want this new thing that I do not currently have." That framing makes the conversation easier for sales, easier for procurement, and easier for the budget holder who has to approve the spend.

In AI products specifically, add-ons carry an additional structural advantage: they map naturally to the cost architecture. A premium model access add-on costs more to serve and therefore justifies a premium price. A fine-tuning module creates a new cost component — training compute, data storage, model hosting — that has a clear incremental cost basis. A higher rate-limit add-on consumes more inference capacity that has a measurable per-unit cost. Unlike traditional software add-ons where the cost of delivering the feature is negligible, AI add-ons have real marginal costs, which means the pricing can be transparently tied to the value delivered without the customer suspecting pure profit extraction.

## The Five Categories of AI Add-Ons

Across the AI product landscape in 2026, the most successful add-on catalogs draw from five categories. Not every product needs all five, but every product should evaluate which ones align with their architecture and their customers' willingness to pay.

The first category is **premium model access**. Your base plan runs on an efficient mid-tier model — something like GPT-5-mini or Claude Sonnet 4.5. The add-on gives customers access to frontier models — GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Deep Think — for tasks that demand the highest accuracy, most nuanced reasoning, or best performance on complex inputs. The cost difference between the mid-tier model and the frontier model can be five to fifteen times per query, which provides a clear cost basis for the add-on price. Customers who need the premium model are typically handling high-value tasks where the quality difference translates directly to business outcomes — legal contract analysis, medical documentation, complex financial modeling. They are paying for quality, and they know it.

GitHub Copilot's Pro+ tier at $39 per month versus Pro at $10 per month is essentially a premium model access add-on. Pro+ includes 1,500 premium requests per month with access to Claude Opus 4 and OpenAI o3, models that are dramatically more capable than the base models included in Pro. The three-to-one price premium reflects both the higher cost of serving those models and the higher value they deliver to developers working on complex codebases.

The second category is **higher rate limits and throughput**. Your base plan includes a defined number of AI interactions per time period. The add-on increases that ceiling. This is the simplest add-on to implement because it requires no new functionality — just a higher number in the rate limiter. It is also the most natural expansion trigger because customers discover the need organically. They hit their limit, they need more, they buy more. The pricing should be linear or slightly degressive — ten times the capacity for eight times the price — creating a volume incentive without giving away margin.

The third category is **custom knowledge and fine-tuning**. This is one of the most powerful add-ons for enterprise AI products because it transforms the product from a general-purpose tool into a company-specific asset. The customer uploads their proprietary data, trains a custom model or builds a custom knowledge base, and gets AI outputs that reflect their terminology, their processes, and their institutional knowledge. Glean charges approximately $15 per user per month on top of the base subscription for generative AI features that leverage the customer's own enterprise knowledge graph. The add-on creates deep switching costs — once a customer has invested in building a custom knowledge base or fine-tuned model, the cost of abandoning it and starting over with a competitor is substantial. This makes the add-on both a revenue driver and a retention mechanism.

The fourth category is **advanced analytics and reporting**. The base plan gives customers the AI output. The add-on gives them visibility into how the AI is performing, what patterns exist in usage, where accuracy is strong or weak, and how ROI trends over time. Enterprise buyers in particular value this because they need to justify the spend internally. A dashboard that shows "your AI assistant resolved 12,400 support tickets this quarter, saving an estimated 8,300 agent hours at a blended cost of $2.10 per resolution versus $14.80 for human resolution" gives the budget holder ammunition for renewal and expansion. The cost of delivering analytics is modest — it is mostly data aggregation and visualization — but the willingness to pay is high because it directly supports the customer's internal business case.

The fifth category is **specialized capability modules**. These are distinct functional areas that extend the core product into adjacent use cases. An AI writing tool might offer a brand voice module, a regulatory compliance module, or a multilingual content module. An AI customer support platform might offer a voice channel module, a proactive outreach module, or a quality assurance module. Each module addresses a distinct use case with its own value proposition, its own cost structure, and its own buyer within the customer's organization. Salesforce's approach with Agentforce illustrates this at scale — Agentforce add-ons start at $125 per user per month for sales, service, or field service agents, with regulated-industry modules at $150 per user per month that include compliance-specific capabilities for financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing. Each module has its own buyer persona, its own ROI calculation, and its own expansion path.

## The Design Principles That Separate Good Add-Ons from Hostageware

The line between a well-designed add-on catalog and what customers call **hostageware** — the feeling that essential features were stripped from the base product and sold back at a premium — is thinner than most teams realize. Cross it, and you do not just lose the add-on sale. You lose the customer's trust, which poisons the entire relationship.

The first principle is **independent value**. Every add-on must deliver value on its own, not merely complete value that the base product should already provide. If your AI assistant cannot answer basic questions without the "knowledge base" add-on, you have not created an add-on. You have created a broken base product with a paid fix. The test is simple: does the base product deliver its core promise without the add-on? If yes, the add-on is genuinely additive. If no, the add-on is a shakedown.

The second principle is **clear incremental cost justification**. Customers accept add-on pricing more readily when they can see why it costs more. "This add-on gives you access to models that cost us ten times more to run" is a justification customers understand. "This add-on gives you a dashboard" is harder to justify at $50 per user per month because customers know dashboards are not expensive to build. The add-ons with the highest adoption rates in AI products are those where the cost basis is transparent: premium models, higher throughput, custom training, dedicated infrastructure. These all have obvious compute costs that map to the price.

The third principle is **natural discovery**. The best add-ons are not sold — they are encountered. The customer hits their rate limit and sees an option to increase it. The customer tries to use a premium model and learns it is available as an add-on. The customer's administrator asks about audit logs and discovers the compliance module. The worst add-on experiences involve a sales rep calling to pitch something the customer did not know existed and does not yet need. When the customer discovers the add-on at the moment they need it, the conversion rate is dramatically higher and the customer satisfaction is dramatically better than when a rep initiates the conversation.

The fourth principle is **no lock-in traps**. Customers should be able to add and remove modules without penalty, without multi-month commitments on individual add-ons, and without losing data or configuration when they downgrade. If a customer activates the fine-tuning module, trains a custom model, then deactivates the module, the custom model should be preserved and reactivable. If removing an add-on destroys work the customer invested in, you have created a lock-in trap that will surface as resentment at renewal time. Flexibility on add-ons actually increases adoption because customers are more willing to try something when they know they can reverse the decision.

The fifth principle is **predictable cost impact**. The customer should be able to calculate exactly what the add-on will cost before they activate it. If the add-on is $15 per user per month and they have forty users, the cost is $600 per month. Simple. If the add-on introduces usage-based pricing on top of a per-user fee, the customer cannot predict the total cost, which creates hesitation. The most successful add-ons in 2026 use flat per-user pricing, flat per-unit pricing, or tiered packages with clear price points. Variable pricing on an add-on adds complexity to an already-complex purchase decision and suppresses adoption rates.

## Building the Add-On Catalog as a Revenue Engine

A random collection of add-ons is a feature list. A structured add-on catalog is a revenue engine. The difference is intentional design around the customer journey and the expansion arc.

The expansion arc for an AI product typically follows a predictable pattern. The customer starts with the base plan, using core features at moderate volume. Over the first three to six months, they increase usage, hit rate limits, and discover the boundaries of what the base plan offers. Between months six and twelve, they evaluate whether to expand — more seats, more capabilities, or both. Between months twelve and eighteen, the most engaged customers are ready for deeper integration: custom models, advanced analytics, specialized modules that extend the product into new use cases within their organization.

Your add-on catalog should be designed to match this arc. Rate limit increases and premium model access are the early-stage add-ons — they address the first scaling need the customer encounters. Custom knowledge bases and fine-tuning are mid-stage add-ons — they deepen the investment and create switching costs. Specialized modules and advanced analytics are late-stage add-ons — they expand the product's footprint into adjacent use cases and new buyer personas within the same organization.

This staged design does two things. First, it creates multiple expansion moments throughout the customer lifecycle, each with its own natural trigger. You do not need to convince a month-three customer to buy everything at once. You need to offer them the right next thing at the moment they are ready for it. Second, it makes the expansion revenue predictable. If you know that forty percent of customers upgrade to premium model access by month four, and twenty percent add custom knowledge bases by month nine, and ten percent add specialized modules by month fourteen, you can forecast expansion revenue with confidence.

## Measuring Add-On Health

Four metrics reveal whether your add-on catalog is working as a revenue engine or sitting idle.

The first is **add-on attach rate**: the percentage of base-plan customers who have purchased at least one add-on. In healthy AI product catalogs, the attach rate after twelve months ranges from twenty-five to forty percent. Below twenty percent, your add-ons are either not solving real problems, not priced correctly, or not being discovered. Above forty percent, you may be under-packaging the base product — consider whether some add-on features should be included in the base to drive higher initial conversion.

The second is **add-on contribution to expansion revenue**: the percentage of total expansion revenue that comes from add-on purchases versus seat growth or usage increases. When add-ons contribute less than thirty percent of expansion revenue, your catalog is underperforming. The best AI product companies in 2026 generate forty to sixty percent of their expansion revenue from add-ons and modules, with the remainder coming from organic seat growth and usage increases.

The third is **add-on churn rate**: the percentage of customers who activate an add-on and then deactivate it within six months. Add-on churn above twenty percent signals a problem — either the add-on did not deliver the value the customer expected, or the value was real but not sustained. Investigate which add-ons churn most and why. If premium model access churns because customers try it and decide the quality difference is not worth the price, you may have a quality gap problem or a pricing problem. If custom knowledge bases churn because the setup was too complex, you have an onboarding problem.

The fourth is **expansion revenue per account over time**: the average incremental revenue generated from add-ons and upsells per customer per quarter. Track this as a time series by customer cohort. Healthy expansion curves show consistent upward slope through the first eighteen months, then plateau as customers settle into their steady-state configuration. Flat expansion curves from the start suggest your add-ons are not being discovered or adopted. Declining curves after initial adoption suggest buyers' remorse or competitive pressure.

## The Relationship Between Add-Ons and Net Dollar Retention

Layer 7 of the AI Pricing Stack — the **Renewal Expansion Strategy** — defines the mechanisms by which each customer's annual spend grows over time. Add-ons are the most controllable lever within that strategy because they are entirely within your power to design, price, and promote. Seat growth depends on the customer's hiring. Usage growth depends on the customer's adoption patterns. Price increases depend on market conditions and competitive dynamics. But the add-on catalog is a product you build, and the expansion revenue it generates is a function of how well you build it.

The math is straightforward. If your average customer starts at $30,000 per year and your gross churn rate is eight percent, you need your surviving customers to grow their spend by at least nine percent per year just to maintain flat revenue. If your add-on catalog drives an average of fifteen percent annual expansion among retained customers, your net dollar retention is approximately 107 percent. At twenty percent expansion, it climbs to 112 percent. Top-performing AI companies in 2026 target net dollar retention between 110 and 120 percent, and the add-on catalog is the primary engine that gets them there.

The compounding effect is what makes this metric so powerful. A customer who starts at $30,000 and expands at fifteen percent annually is worth $30,000 in year one, $34,500 in year two, $39,675 in year three, and $45,626 in year four. Over four years, that single customer generates nearly $150,000 in cumulative revenue from a $30,000 starting point. Multiply that across your customer base, and the add-on catalog is not a nice-to-have feature of your packaging strategy. It is the financial engine that determines whether your company compounds or stalls.

The add-on catalog is the expansion lever. But expansion only works when the limits and boundaries within each plan are set correctly — too generous, and customers never need add-ons; too restrictive, and they feel punished for using the product. The next subchapter examines usage limits and overage pricing: the psychology of caps and how to set boundaries that drive expansion without creating resentment.
