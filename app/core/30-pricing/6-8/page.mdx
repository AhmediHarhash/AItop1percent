# 30.6.8 — The Provider Dependency Risk Register

**Single-Provider Dependency** is the most common and most dangerous structural risk in AI product economics. It is also the one most teams refuse to acknowledge until it costs them revenue, margin, or both. The pattern looks like this: a team builds on one model provider because it is the best fit at the time, optimizes every prompt, every evaluation suite, and every latency target for that provider's specific model, and over the course of twelve to eighteen months creates an architecture where switching providers would require rewriting half the system. The team knows this. They rationalize it as acceptable because the provider is reliable, the model is good, and the migration cost is high enough that the problem feels theoretical. Then the provider changes something — the pricing, the model, the terms, the rate limits — and the theoretical problem becomes a P&L emergency.

This is not an edge case. It is the default state of most AI companies in 2026. Surveys of enterprise AI adopters consistently show that the majority rely on a single primary model provider for over eighty percent of their inference workload. The reasons are understandable: prompt engineering is provider-specific, evaluation baselines are model-specific, and the switching cost is real. But understandable is not the same as safe. A business whose gross margin depends entirely on a single provider's pricing decisions is a business that does not fully control its own economics.

## The Five Categories of Provider Dependency Risk

Provider dependency is not a single risk. It is a portfolio of risks that interact with each other and compound under stress. The **Provider Dependency Risk Register** is a structured assessment that forces your team to evaluate every dimension of the risk, assign probability and impact scores, and define mitigations before any of the risks materialize.

The five categories are pricing risk, availability risk, capability risk, terms risk, and competitive risk. Each operates on its own timeline, each has different warning signals, and each requires a different mitigation strategy. Most teams think about one or two of these. The register forces you to think about all five simultaneously, because a provider change often triggers multiple categories at once — a price increase accompanied by a model deprecation accompanied by updated terms of service is not a hypothetical scenario. It is a quarterly reality in the 2025-2026 AI market.

## Pricing Risk: They Change What They Charge

Pricing risk is the most obvious category and the one that hits your P&L most directly. Your model provider changes their per-token rates, and your cost-to-serve shifts overnight. The risk runs in both directions, and both directions are dangerous.

When the provider raises prices, your gross margin compresses immediately. If you are running at sixty percent gross margin and your inference costs represent thirty percent of revenue, a fifty percent increase in API pricing drops your gross margin to forty-five percent. That is the difference between a healthy SaaS business and a business that struggles to fund growth. When OpenAI restructured pricing tiers for high-volume enterprise customers in late 2025, several AI startups built on GPT-5 saw their negotiated rates increase by twenty to thirty-five percent because the new pricing reflected the actual compute intensity of reasoning-mode queries that the previous structure had underpriced.

When the provider drops prices dramatically — which has been the dominant trend, with inference costs declining by roughly ten to fifty times per year at equivalent quality levels according to Epoch AI research — a different risk emerges. Your competitors who were priced out of using premium models can now afford them. Customers who accepted your premium because raw API access was expensive now recalculate whether they need you at all. The price drop does not hurt your cost-to-serve, but it erodes the competitive moat that your access to expensive models once provided.

The mitigation for pricing risk is contractual and architectural. On the contractual side, negotiate committed-spend agreements with price protection clauses that lock in rates for twelve to twenty-four months. On the architectural side, ensure your system can route between at least two providers within forty-eight hours so that a price increase on one provider can be partially absorbed by shifting traffic to an alternative.

## Availability Risk: They Go Down and You Go Down

Availability risk is the operational dimension of provider dependency. When your provider has an outage, your product has an outage. When your provider experiences degraded performance — slower response times, higher error rates, reduced throughput — your product experiences the same degradation, and your customers blame you, not the provider.

Major cloud AI providers maintained availability above 99.9 percent across 2025, but that number obscures the impact of the outages that did occur. A four-hour degradation event on a major API provider during peak business hours affects millions of downstream API calls. If your product serves enterprise customers with SLA commitments of 99.95 percent uptime, a single provider outage can consume your entire quarterly error budget. The downstream cost is not just the SLA credits you owe. It is the trust erosion with enterprise customers who expected you to have redundancy.

The mitigation is multi-provider failover. Not multi-provider as a strategy discussion — multi-provider as a deployed, tested, monitored capability. Your system should be able to detect provider degradation within sixty seconds, route traffic to an alternative provider within five minutes, and operate on the alternative provider with acceptable quality until the primary recovers. This requires maintaining prompt compatibility across at least two providers, running continuous evaluation on the alternative to ensure quality parity, and testing the failover path monthly, not annually. The cost of maintaining a warm secondary provider is real — typically five to fifteen percent of your primary provider spend for standby readiness and continuous evaluation — but it is dramatically less than the cost of a multi-hour outage that violates enterprise SLAs and triggers churn conversations.

## Capability Risk: They Deprecate Your Model

Capability risk is the product development dimension of provider dependency. Your provider deprecates the model your product is built on, and you are forced to migrate to a replacement that behaves differently.

This risk is not theoretical. It is the most predictable risk in the register because every model has a lifecycle, and providers telegraph deprecation months in advance. OpenAI deprecated GPT-4 from ChatGPT in April 2025, deprecated GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 from ChatGPT in February 2026, and maintains a published deprecation schedule. Anthropic, Google, and every other major provider follow similar patterns. The question is never whether your current model will be deprecated. The question is whether your product can survive the transition.

The danger is not the deprecation announcement itself. It is the behavioral differences between the deprecated model and its replacement. A model migration is not a version upgrade. It is a behavioral shift. The replacement model may be more capable on benchmarks but produce different outputs for your specific prompts. It may handle edge cases differently. It may have different latency characteristics, different token-per-response patterns, different tendencies around refusal, verbosity, or reasoning style. If your product's quality was tuned for the specific behaviors of the deprecated model — and it almost certainly was, because prompt engineering is inherently model-specific — the migration is a product quality event, not just an infrastructure event.

The mitigation for capability risk is continuous cross-model evaluation. Maintain an evaluation suite that runs against your current primary model and at least one alternative model on a weekly cadence. When you receive a deprecation notice, you should already know how the successor model performs on your evaluation suite. If the quality gap is within acceptable bounds, the migration is routine. If the quality gap is significant, you have the deprecation timeline — typically six to twelve months — to adjust prompts, retune systems, and close the gap before the cutoff.

## Terms Risk: They Change the Rules

Terms risk is the legal and business dimension of provider dependency. Your provider changes their terms of service, their acceptable use policy, their data handling practices, or their competitive restrictions, and the change affects how you can use their models in your product.

This category of risk receives the least attention and creates some of the most disruptive surprises. Terms changes can restrict the industries you serve, the ways you use model outputs, or the data you send through the API. A provider that introduces a restriction on using their models for certain categories of content generation could invalidate your product's core use case overnight. A provider that changes their data retention policy could create compliance conflicts with your customers' data governance requirements. A provider that adds a clause allowing them to use API interactions for model improvement — even temporarily, before public backlash forces a reversal — creates an immediate trust problem with enterprise customers in regulated industries.

The mitigation for terms risk is legal monitoring and contractual protection. Have your legal team review provider terms of service on a quarterly cadence, not just at initial contracting. Negotiate enterprise agreements that override default terms with explicit protections for data handling, usage rights, and competitive restrictions. For the most critical protections — data exclusion from training, guaranteed availability of models for your use cases, advance notice of terms changes — get them in writing in your enterprise contract, not in the provider's general terms that can change with thirty days' notice.

## Competitive Risk: They Build Your Product

Competitive risk is the existential dimension of provider dependency. Your model provider, who has access to aggregated usage patterns across thousands of API customers, identifies your product category as attractive and launches a competing product.

This is the risk that keeps AI founders awake at night, and it should. The major model providers are not neutral infrastructure companies. They are product companies with their own ambitions. OpenAI builds ChatGPT, which competes with every chatbot built on the OpenAI API. Google builds Gemini-powered features across Workspace, Search, and Cloud, which compete with AI products built on Vertex AI. Anthropic builds Claude consumer products and partnerships that overlap with applications built on the Claude API. Every model provider has the data to identify which product categories generate the most API volume, the engineering talent to build competitive products, and the distribution advantage to reach customers directly.

The mitigation for competitive risk is the hardest because it requires building defensibility that transcends the model layer. If your product's only value is a nice interface on top of a provider's API, you are one product announcement away from irrelevance. The companies that survive competitive risk from their providers are the ones that build value the provider cannot replicate: proprietary training data specific to a domain, deep workflow integration that makes switching expensive, regulatory compliance infrastructure that takes years to build, and customer relationships rooted in trust that a new entrant cannot earn overnight. Harvey survives despite OpenAI and Anthropic both pursuing legal market opportunities because Harvey has built domain-specific legal AI capabilities, secured exclusive access to LexisNexis legal databases, and earned the trust of major law firms through years of deployment — none of which a model provider can replicate with a product launch.

## Building the Risk Register

The Provider Dependency Risk Register is a living document, not a one-time exercise. It requires quarterly review because the risk landscape shifts with every provider announcement, every pricing change, and every competitive development.

For each of the five risk categories, the register captures four elements. First, the current risk level — assessed as low, medium, or high based on the probability of the risk materializing within the next twelve months and the severity of the impact if it does. Second, the specific trigger events that would escalate the risk — a scheduled model deprecation, a pending terms of service update, a rumored competitive product launch. Third, the current mitigation status — what you have already done to reduce the risk, and how effective those mitigations are. Fourth, the mitigation gaps — what you have not yet done, what it would cost, and what the timeline is to close the gap.

The register should be owned by a single person — typically the VP of Engineering or the Head of Platform — and reviewed by the executive team quarterly. It is not an engineering document. It is a business continuity document. When the register shows high risk in multiple categories with significant mitigation gaps, that is a board-level conversation about strategic investment in provider diversification. When the register shows low risk across categories with strong mitigations, that is a signal that the team has done the infrastructure work to operate confidently despite the dependency.

## The Cost of Mitigation vs the Cost of Crisis

Teams resist investing in provider diversification because the cost feels concrete while the risk feels abstract. Maintaining prompt compatibility across two providers adds fifteen to twenty percent to prompt engineering costs. Running continuous evaluation on an alternative model adds ten to fifteen percent to evaluation infrastructure costs. Negotiating enterprise agreements with multiple providers requires legal resources and executive attention. The total cost of a properly maintained multi-provider strategy is typically twenty to thirty percent higher than a single-provider approach.

Compare that to the cost of a provider crisis. When a pricing change compresses your gross margin by fifteen points, you lose months of revenue trajectory. When a model deprecation forces an emergency migration, you pull engineers off product development for six to twelve weeks. When a terms change creates compliance conflicts, you involve legal, customer success, and executive leadership in a scramble that disrupts every other priority. When a provider launches a competitive product, you lose sales pipeline immediately and face existential questions about your business model. Any one of these crises costs more than years of mitigation investment. The register exists to make this math visible and to convert abstract risk into concrete budget allocation.

## The Register as Competitive Intelligence

The Provider Dependency Risk Register has a secondary benefit that most teams overlook: it is a source of competitive intelligence about your own market position. When you map your dependency risks, you are also mapping the dependency risks of every competitor who uses the same providers. A pricing change that hurts you also hurts them. A model deprecation that disrupts your product also disrupts theirs. A competitive product from a provider that threatens you also threatens them.

The companies that invest in mitigation before the crisis gain a competitive advantage when the crisis arrives. If your competitor is locked into a single provider and you have a functioning multi-provider strategy, a provider price increase that compresses their margins is an event you weather and they scramble to survive. If your competitor has not tested model migration and you have, a model deprecation is a quality event for them and a routine transition for you. The register is not just a risk management tool. It is a competitive strategy tool that turns your infrastructure investment into market advantage precisely when the market gets disrupted.

The provider dependency risks in your register are amplified by a larger market force that affects every AI company regardless of provider strategy. Inference costs are declining at a rate that makes last year's pricing model obsolete by next quarter. That force — the relentless commoditization of AI compute — is the subject of the next subchapter.
