# 30.3.10 — The Pricing Migration: Changing Models Without Losing Customers

In early 2025, a developer tools company with 1,400 paying customers launched what should have been a straightforward pricing change. Their AI coding assistant had been priced at $29 per seat per month since launch — a clean, simple number that customers understood and sales could quote in thirty seconds. But the per-seat model was bleeding margin. Heavy users generated eighty to a hundred AI completions per hour and cost $47 per seat per month to serve. Light users generated five completions per hour and cost $1.80. The average margin across the customer base was forty-one percent, but the distribution was brutal: thirty-eight percent of seats were margin-negative. The CFO ran the numbers and the conclusion was unambiguous. The company needed a usage-based component in its pricing. The CEO agreed. The product team designed a credit system. Engineering built the metering infrastructure. Marketing prepared the announcement. On the first of March, they flipped the switch — new pricing for all customers, effective immediately.

Within four weeks, the company lost eighteen percent of its paying customers. Not the margin-negative heavy users. The light users. The ones who had been profitable, quiet, and satisfied. They saw the usage-based pricing, did the math on what their bill might be if they used the product more, and decided the uncertainty was not worth it. The heavy users stayed — they were too embedded to leave — but they immediately began optimizing their usage to minimize the bill, which reduced the value they extracted from the product, which made them less likely to expand. Revenue dropped twenty-two percent. Net revenue retention fell from 108 percent to 87 percent. The board called an emergency meeting. Nine months of margin analysis, system design, and pricing strategy had produced a result that was worse on every metric than doing nothing.

The company's mistake was not the new pricing model. The credit system was well-designed. The mistake was the migration. They changed the price for everyone, all at once, with no transition period, no grandfather clause, and no comparison tool that showed each customer what they would actually pay under the new model. They treated pricing migration as a product launch when it is actually a change management operation — and one of the most dangerous ones in the business.

## Why Pricing Migrations Are Uniquely Dangerous

Every business changes prices. Restaurants raise menu prices. Retailers run promotions and then raise baselines. Even traditional SaaS companies increase per-seat costs annually. These changes are routine because the pricing model does not change. The customer pays more per unit, but the unit is the same. They understand the mechanics. They can predict the impact.

A **pricing migration** is fundamentally different. You are not changing the price. You are changing the model — the mechanism by which the customer is charged. Moving from per-seat to per-usage. Moving from flat subscription to tiered consumption. Moving from consumption to outcomes. Each migration changes the mental model the customer uses to understand their cost. And when a customer cannot predict their bill, they do one of three things: leave, freeze, or complain. None of these outcomes are what you intended.

The psychological research on loss aversion explains why pricing migrations trigger disproportionate reactions. Losing something you have — in this case, predictable pricing — feels roughly twice as painful as gaining something equivalent. A customer who pays $29 per seat and switches to a usage model that would cost them $24 per seat at current usage does not feel like they saved $5. They feel like they lost the certainty of knowing their bill. The $5 savings is a fact. The anxiety about future bills is a feeling. The feeling wins.

This is why pricing migrations have a higher failure rate than almost any other business operation. Industry surveys consistently show that poorly executed pricing changes trigger ten to fifteen percent customer churn in the quarter following the change, with the effect concentrated among smaller customers who have the most options and the least switching cost. The irony is that the customers you lose are almost never the ones the pricing change was designed to address.

## The Leena AI Lesson: When the Model Fights the Product

One of the clearest examples of pricing model failure — and the courage to fix it — comes from Leena AI, which builds AI-powered employee support agents for enterprises. Leena AI initially priced on consumption: the more an enterprise used the AI agents, the more they paid. The logic seemed sound. Usage-based pricing aligns cost with value. Heavier users pay more. The economics scale.

Except usage-based pricing created exactly the wrong incentive for an employee support product. The entire point of an internal AI agent is that employees use it freely, for every question, without hesitation. An employee who wonders "should I ask the AI or figure it out myself because each query costs my company money?" is an employee who is not getting value from the product. Consumption pricing turned the product's success metric — adoption rate — into a cost the customer wanted to minimize. The more the product worked, the more it cost. The more it cost, the more finance teams pushed back on expanding access. Adoption stalled not because the product was bad, but because the pricing model punished success.

Leena AI recognized the pattern and made the hard call: they migrated from consumption pricing to outcome-based pricing. Instead of charging per query or per interaction, they priced around outcomes — problems resolved, tickets deflected, employee issues handled without human escalation. The shift was dramatic for both sides. Customers could now predict their annual cost because they were buying outcomes, not metering interactions. Employees could use the AI freely because no one was watching per-query costs. Adoption accelerated. Customer satisfaction improved. Revenue per customer actually increased because the outcome-based price captured more value than the per-query price ever had.

The lesson is not that consumption pricing is wrong. It is that the pricing model must align with the product's value delivery mechanism. When the model creates friction that contradicts the product's purpose, no amount of optimization will fix it. The model itself must change.

## The Salesforce Flex Credits Migration

Salesforce's Agentforce pricing evolution illustrates what a well-resourced migration looks like at scale. When Salesforce launched Agentforce, it priced AI agent interactions at $2 per conversation. The number was simple and the model was intuitive: each conversation the AI agent handled had a price. But enterprises struggled with forecasting. How many conversations would their agents handle? What counted as a conversation? Would a complex multi-turn interaction cost the same as a simple one-turn resolution?

In May 2025, Salesforce introduced **Flex Credits** — a consumption currency that replaced the per-conversation model. Each AI agent action consumes credits, and credits are purchased in packs. The shift from per-conversation to per-action granularity gave customers more predictability because actions are smaller and more predictable than conversations. Salesforce added multiple payment options: committed credit packs at a volume discount, pay-as-you-go pricing for unpredictable workloads starting in August 2025, and per-user licenses for unlimited internal agent usage at $125 per user per month. Existing customers on the $2-per-conversation model were given migration paths to the credit system, with tools to estimate their credit consumption based on historical conversation data.

Salesforce could execute this migration without catastrophic churn because they did three things that most companies skip. First, they introduced the new model alongside the old model rather than replacing it overnight. Customers could evaluate the credit system while still running on per-conversation pricing. Second, they provided free credits to Enterprise Edition customers through Salesforce Foundations, which eliminated the risk of trying the new model. Third, they offered multiple payment structures within the new model — committed, pay-as-you-go, and per-user — so customers could choose the structure that matched their usage pattern rather than being forced into a single new model. The migration was not a mandate. It was an invitation with economic incentives to accept.

## The Migration Framework

Whether you are moving from per-seat to usage-based, from consumption to outcome-based, or from flat subscription to hybrid, the mechanics of a safe pricing migration follow a consistent pattern. The companies that execute this well share five practices.

**Practice one: grandfather existing customers.** The simplest way to eliminate churn from a pricing change is to not change the price for people who are already paying it. Grandfather existing customers on their current plan for a defined period — six to twelve months is the standard window, though some companies extend to twenty-four months for their largest accounts. During the grandfather period, the customer keeps their current pricing and terms. New customers sign up on the new model. The grandfather period gives existing customers time to evaluate the new model without pressure and gives you time to accumulate data on how the new model performs with new customers before applying it to your installed base.

The objection to grandfathering is that it delays the economic benefit of the pricing change. If the whole point of the migration was to fix margin on existing customers, grandfathering them for twelve months means twelve more months of bad economics. This objection misses the bigger picture. The economic benefit of keeping the customer is almost always larger than the economic cost of the grandfather period. An enterprise customer paying $5,000 per month on an old plan that should be $7,500 is still generating $60,000 per year in revenue. Losing that customer to a botched migration generates zero. Twelve months of grandfathering costs you $30,000 in foregone revenue. Losing the customer costs you $60,000 per year, forever.

**Practice two: move new customers first.** Every new customer who signs up after the migration announcement goes on the new pricing model. No exceptions. This gives you the fastest feedback loop — you learn how the new model performs in sales conversations, onboarding, and billing within weeks rather than months. It also means that by the time you migrate existing customers, you have live data showing that the new model works. You can tell existing customers: "Three hundred new customers have been on this model for eight months, and here is what their experience looks like." Data from your own customer base is more persuasive than any amount of theoretical modeling.

**Practice three: build the comparison tool.** The single highest-impact investment you can make during a pricing migration is a calculator that shows each existing customer what they would pay under the new model, using their actual historical usage data. Not a generic estimate. Their specific number. "Based on your usage over the last six months, your monthly cost under the new model would be $6,200, compared to your current $5,800." This transparency accomplishes two things. It eliminates the fear of the unknown — the customer knows exactly what the change means for them. And it identifies the customers for whom the new model is significantly more expensive, so your account team can proactively address those situations before the migration happens.

The comparison tool also reveals whether your new model is priced correctly. If the tool shows that eighty percent of customers would pay more under the new model, the new model is a price increase disguised as a model change, and customers will see through it immediately. If the tool shows that sixty percent of customers would pay roughly the same, twenty percent would pay less, and twenty percent would pay more, the new model is a genuine structural improvement that redistributes cost more fairly — and that story is much easier to tell.

**Practice four: communicate the "why" before the "what."** Most companies announce pricing changes by leading with the new model — "we are moving to a credit-based system" — and then explaining why. This is backwards. The customer hears the change first and immediately enters defensive mode. Everything that follows is filtered through anxiety and resistance.

Lead with the problem. "Our current per-seat model charges the same price to a customer who uses the product ten times a month and a customer who uses it ten thousand times. That means light users subsidize heavy users. We do not think that is fair, and neither do many of you. We are moving to a model that aligns cost with usage so that every customer pays for what they actually use." Now the customer understands the rationale before they hear the mechanics. They may not love the change, but they cannot argue with the fairness principle. The "why" creates a frame that makes the "what" easier to accept.

**Practice five: time the migration to renewal.** For contract-based customers, the natural migration point is the renewal. You do not change the contract mid-term. You present the new model as part of the renewal conversation, sixty to ninety days before the contract expires. The customer expects a renewal conversation. They expect the terms to be discussed. Introducing the new model at this point feels like a normal business negotiation rather than a unilateral change imposed without warning. Industry data consistently shows that pricing changes executed at renewal trigger less than half the churn of pricing changes executed mid-contract.

## The Migration Timeline

A well-executed pricing migration takes six to nine months from decision to full rollout. Rushing it is the single most common cause of failure.

Months one and two: internal alignment. The executive team, sales leadership, customer success leadership, and finance agree on the new model, the migration timeline, the grandfather terms, and the escalation process for customers who push back. Sales teams are trained on how to position the new model. Customer success teams are briefed on the objections they will hear and the responses they should give.

Months two through four: new customers only. All new customers sign on the new model. Sales teams report on win rates, deal velocity, common objections, and pricing negotiations. Finance tracks the economics of new customers versus old customers. Product builds the comparison tool for existing customers.

Months four through six: proactive outreach to existing customers. Account managers reach out to each customer with their personalized comparison, explaining the new model and the grandfather timeline. High-value accounts get dedicated conversations. Small accounts get email communication with access to the comparison tool and a FAQ page. Customers who would pay significantly more under the new model get individual attention — either an extended grandfather period, a custom transition price, or a restructured plan that acknowledges their usage pattern.

Months six through nine: rolling migration. Existing customers transition to the new model, starting with those whose grandfather period expires first. Each cohort is monitored for churn, usage changes, and billing complaints. If a cohort shows elevated churn — more than five percent above baseline — the migration pauses while the team investigates and adjusts.

## The Best Time to Change Pricing

There is a counterintuitive truth about pricing migrations that every founder learns too late: the best time to change your pricing model is before you need to.

When you change pricing because your margins are in crisis, the change is reactive. The timeline is compressed. The pressure to capture margin immediately overrides the patience required for a safe migration. You cannot afford a twelve-month grandfather period when the board is asking why margins are falling. The migration gets rushed. Customers get upset. Churn spikes. The very crisis that motivated the change gets worse.

When you change pricing while your business is healthy — margins are acceptable, growth is strong, customers are satisfied — the change is proactive. You have the luxury of a long timeline. You can grandfather generously. You can run the new model with new customers for six months before touching existing accounts. You can absorb short-term revenue fluctuations without triggering a board-level crisis. The migration happens smoothly because there is no panic driving the schedule.

The practical implication is that you should start evaluating your pricing model for structural fitness every quarter, not just when the numbers turn bad. Ask the three diagnostic questions: Does our model align with how customers get value? Does our model incentivize the behaviors we want? Does our model protect our margins as customers scale? If the answer to any of these is "not entirely," start planning the migration while you still have the time and the margin to execute it well.

## When Migration Fails Despite Good Execution

Sometimes a well-executed migration still fails. The communication was thoughtful. The grandfather period was generous. The comparison tool was accurate. And customers still left.

When this happens, the cause is almost always one of two things. The first is that the new model genuinely delivers less value to a meaningful segment of customers. If your old model included unlimited usage and your new model meters usage, customers who valued the unlimited access do not care about fairness arguments or economic rationale. They are losing something they had, and no amount of communication changes that. The solution is either to keep an unlimited tier available at a price that covers the economics, or to accept that this segment will churn and ensure that the customers who stay generate enough incremental revenue to compensate.

The second cause is that the migration exposed a value perception problem that already existed. Customers who were marginal — using the product lightly, not fully convinced it was worth the price — used the pricing change as the trigger to evaluate whether they should be paying at all. The pricing change did not cause their dissatisfaction. It surfaced it. These are customers who would have churned at their next renewal anyway. The migration simply accelerated the timeline. The consolation is that the customers who survive a pricing migration are your strongest, most committed accounts — the foundation on which the next phase of growth is built.

Pricing migration is one dimension of the challenge. But what happens when the pricing complexity goes even deeper — when your platform includes both AI and traditional software features with fundamentally different cost structures, and you need a single pricing model that covers both? That is the multi-product pricing problem, and it is where this chapter concludes.
