# Chapter 4 — Packaging, Tiering, and the Feature Gate

Pricing sets the number. Packaging determines what the customer actually gets for that number — and in AI products, this distinction matters more than in any other category of software. A traditional SaaS tier might gate features behind plan levels, but the marginal cost of giving a higher-tier customer access to one more feature was negligible. In AI, every tier decision carries real cost implications: the model behind the premium feature is more expensive to run, the unlimited plan attracts heavy users who blow through your margin, and the free tier that drives adoption also drives your compute bill. This chapter teaches the packaging discipline specific to AI — tier design that creates expansion pressure, feature gating that protects margin, and the strategic decision of whether AI is a feature you add, a product you sell, or a platform you become.

*A great pricing model with bad packaging leaves money on the table at every tier. Packaging is where strategy meets the customer's purchase decision — and most AI companies get it wrong on the first try.*
