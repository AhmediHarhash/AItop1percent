# 30.2.6 — The Negative-Margin Customer: When to Fire, When to Fix, When to Reprice

Every customer is not worth keeping. This statement makes most founders physically uncomfortable, and that discomfort is exactly why negative-margin customers survive for months or years inside AI companies, silently draining margin while everyone pretends the problem will solve itself. The instinct to retain every customer is a holdover from traditional SaaS, where the marginal cost of serving an additional customer was essentially zero and every retained dollar of ARR was pure profit. In AI, where every query burns compute and every customer has a different cost-to-serve, the math is different. A customer who pays you $8,000 per month and costs you $11,500 per month to serve is not a revenue source. They are a $3,500 monthly expense with a logo attached.

The **Negative-Margin Customer** is any customer whose cost-to-serve exceeds the revenue they generate, fully loaded. Not just inference costs — the full stack: model inference, retrieval infrastructure, human review escalations, customer support tickets, custom configuration maintenance, and any dedicated engineering time their account requires. When you run this calculation honestly, most AI companies discover that between eight and fifteen percent of their customer base is margin-negative. The top-line revenue from those customers masks the bottom-line reality that the company is paying to serve them.

## Why Negative-Margin Customers Persist

Three forces conspire to keep negative-margin customers alive long past the point where rational economics would suggest action.

The first force is revenue vanity. A $120,000 annual contract looks good on the ARR dashboard, in the board deck, and on the sales leaderboard. Nobody wants to lose that number. The fact that the customer costs $165,000 per year to serve does not appear on any of those surfaces. Revenue is visible, celebrated, and compensated. Cost-to-serve is buried in infrastructure line items, allocated imprecisely, and reviewed — if at all — by a finance team that does not have per-customer attribution. The organizational incentive structure rewards keeping the customer and punishes losing the revenue, regardless of the margin underneath.

The second force is strategic hope. The customer is a large logo, or they are in a strategic vertical, or they have promised to expand next quarter, or they have executive relationships that could lead to referrals. Each of these justifications has a kernel of truth and a mountain of rationalization around it. The large logo has brand value — but brand value does not pay your inference bill. The strategic vertical is important — but subsidizing one customer's usage does not prove market fit in that vertical. The expansion promise is credible — but expanding a negative-margin account just means you lose more money faster. Strategic value is real, but it must be quantified and weighed against the actual cost, not invoked as a vague justification for unlimited subsidy.

The third force is churn fear. In a market where customer acquisition costs are high and competitive alternatives are multiplying, losing any customer feels dangerous. What if they go to a competitor and become a case study? What if the churn shows up in our metrics and scares investors? What if the team that pushed for this customer feels demoralized? These fears are emotionally compelling and economically irrelevant. A customer who costs you $3,500 per month more than they pay is not a customer you lost. They are a cost you shed. The day they churn, your margin improves by $3,500 per month. The competitor who acquires them inherits a customer who will do the same thing to their margins unless they price differently.

## The Three-Response Framework: Fire, Fix, Reprice

Not every negative-margin customer warrants the same response. The right action depends on two variables: the size of the margin gap and the structural cause of the gap. These two variables produce three distinct strategies.

**Fire** means exiting the customer relationship — not renewing the contract, declining to extend, or in extreme cases, providing notice of service termination. Firing is the right response when the margin gap is large and the cause is structural. A structural cause means the customer's usage pattern is inherently misaligned with your pricing model, and no feasible engineering or pricing change can close the gap. A customer who uses your product as a bulk processing engine, running 50,000 queries per day through your most expensive model tier, on a flat-rate plan designed for interactive use cases of 2,000 queries per day, has a structural misalignment. Your product is not designed for their use case. Their usage will not decrease. The margin gap is not a problem to solve — it is a signal that this customer belongs on a different product, possibly one they build themselves.

The fire threshold is quantitative. If a customer's cost-to-serve exceeds their revenue by more than forty percent and the gap has been stable or widening for two consecutive quarters, the relationship is structurally unprofitable. Engineering cannot close a forty percent gap without fundamentally changing the product for that customer, and repricing by forty percent is unlikely to succeed without losing the customer anyway. The cleanest path is a graceful exit: give the customer six months notice, offer to help them transition to an alternative, and redeploy the engineering and support resources currently subsidizing their account toward customers who are actually profitable.

Firing is hard emotionally and easy economically. A company that exits its five most negative-margin customers — say $18,000 per month in combined revenue that costs $29,000 per month to deliver — loses $216,000 in annual revenue and saves $348,000 in annual cost. Net improvement: $132,000 per year, plus the engineering hours and support bandwidth that were consumed by those accounts. In practice, the freed capacity often generates more revenue than the lost accounts because the team can focus on acquiring and serving customers who fit the product.

## When to Fix

**Fix** means engineering the cost-to-serve down until the customer becomes margin-positive, without changing what the customer pays. Fixing is the right response when the margin gap is small to moderate — the customer's cost-to-serve exceeds revenue by less than twenty-five percent — and the cause is an engineering inefficiency rather than a fundamental misalignment. The customer's usage pattern is within the bounds your product was designed for. They are just hitting your cost structure harder than average because of a specific, identifiable reason that your engineering team can address.

Common fixable causes include routing failures, where the customer's query mix should be partially routable to cheaper models but is not because the routing layer was not trained on their query patterns. A customer in a specialized domain — say veterinary medicine or maritime law — may use terminology that your query classifier does not recognize as simple, so their simple queries get routed to the expensive model tier by default. Retraining the classifier on a sample of their queries can shift thirty to fifty percent of their traffic to cheaper models within weeks.

Another fixable cause is caching underutilization. Some customers ask highly repetitive questions — their users are in a compliance-checking workflow where the same regulatory questions recur across hundreds of cases. Semantic caching should catch sixty to seventy percent of these queries, but if the customer was onboarded before your caching layer was deployed, or if their queries use slightly different phrasing that falls below your similarity threshold, the cache misses and every query hits the model. Tuning the cache for their specific query patterns can eliminate a large fraction of their inference cost.

A third fixable cause is excessive call chains. Some customers trigger more model calls per action than others because of how they use the product. A customer who always requests detailed explanations alongside their analysis triggers a summarization call plus an explanation call, while a customer who only needs the summary triggers one call. If the explanation can be generated within the same call by adjusting the prompt, the cost drops by nearly half for that customer's usage pattern.

The fix threshold works like this. If the margin gap is less than twenty-five percent and you can identify a specific engineering intervention that would close most of the gap within sixty days, fix it. Track the cost-to-serve weekly during the fix period. If the gap closes to positive margin, the customer stays and you have gained a scalable optimization that likely applies to other customers with similar patterns. If the gap does not close after the intervention, escalate to the reprice decision.

## When to Reprice

**Reprice** means changing the commercial terms — what the customer pays — to reflect the actual cost of serving them. Repricing is the right response when the margin gap is moderate, the customer is strategically valuable enough to retain, and the cause of the gap is a pricing structure that does not match the customer's usage reality. The customer is not abusing the product. The engineering is not inefficient. The pricing simply does not account for the way this customer uses the product.

The most common repricing scenario is a customer on a flat-rate plan whose usage has grown far beyond what the flat rate was designed to cover. They signed at $8,000 per month when they were running 5,000 queries per month. Eighteen months later, they are running 28,000 queries per month because they expanded the tool across three more departments and built two integrations. The price never adjusted. The cost-to-serve quintupled. The customer is not at fault — they are using the product exactly as intended. The pricing just failed to scale with usage.

Repricing conversations are delicate but not impossible. The key is data transparency. Show the customer exactly what they are consuming. Show them how their usage compares to other customers on the same plan. Show them the value they are receiving — if your product is saving them $45,000 per month in labor costs and they are paying $8,000, a repricing to $14,000 still leaves them with $31,000 in net savings. Frame the conversation around sustainability and continued investment: "We want to continue investing in the product capabilities you depend on, and we need the commercial terms to support that investment."

The reprice threshold is relational, not just numerical. If the customer's cost-to-serve exceeds revenue by fifteen to forty percent, the customer has strategic or expansion value, and the gap is primarily caused by usage growth that outpaced the pricing structure, reprice. The new pricing should achieve at least a twenty percent gross margin on the customer at their current usage level, with a consumption component that scales with future usage growth. A hybrid structure — base platform fee plus per-query consumption — is almost always the right landing point because it gives the customer cost predictability through the base fee while protecting your margin through the consumption component.

Expect pushback. Some customers will negotiate. Some will threaten to leave. A small number will actually leave. This is acceptable. A customer who leaves rather than pay a price that still delivers them significant net value was never a sustainable relationship. A customer who negotiates and lands at a price that makes both sides viable is a stronger, more durable partnership than the one where you silently subsidized them.

## The Decision Framework in Practice

The decision sequence flows from data to diagnosis to action. Start by running a cost-to-serve analysis on every customer, fully loaded. Rank them by margin contribution from highest to lowest. The bottom ten percent are your investigation candidates.

For each candidate, calculate the margin gap as a percentage: cost-to-serve minus revenue, divided by revenue. A customer paying $10,000 per month with a cost-to-serve of $13,000 has a gap of thirty percent. A customer paying $6,000 with a cost-to-serve of $10,200 has a gap of seventy percent.

If the gap is above forty percent and has been stable or widening for two quarters, the customer is a fire candidate. Verify that no strategic value justifies continued subsidy — and "strategic value" must be quantified, not just asserted. A logo that generates three referrals per year worth $50,000 each in new business has $150,000 in strategic value that can offset a $42,000 annual margin deficit. A logo that "might lead to enterprise expansion someday" has zero quantifiable strategic value and should not be used to justify ongoing losses.

If the gap is below twenty-five percent and you can identify a specific engineering fix, the customer is a fix candidate. Assign the engineering work, set a sixty-day deadline, and track cost-to-serve weekly. If the fix works, document it and apply it proactively to similar customers before they become negative-margin too.

If the gap is between fifteen and forty percent, the cause is primarily usage growth beyond the pricing structure, and the customer has demonstrated value, the customer is a reprice candidate. Prepare the data, build the business case, and schedule the conversation for the next contract renewal if possible or sooner if the margin gap is accelerating.

## The Portfolio View

Individual customer decisions matter, but the portfolio view matters more. After you have classified your negative-margin customers and taken action, step back and ask what the pattern tells you about your business.

If most of your negative-margin customers are heavy users on flat-rate plans, your pricing model has a structural flaw. The fix is not individual repricing — it is a pricing model change that introduces consumption-based components for all customers going forward, preventing new negative-margin relationships from forming.

If most of your negative-margin customers are in a specific vertical or use case, your product may have a cost problem in that domain. Perhaps queries in that vertical are inherently more complex, requiring more tokens and more expensive models. The fix might be domain-specific routing optimization, or it might be a vertical-specific pricing tier that reflects the higher cost-to-serve.

If your negative-margin customers are randomly distributed with no clear pattern, your per-customer cost attribution may be inaccurate. Cost-to-serve calculations are only as good as the attribution model underneath them. If your infrastructure costs are allocated by customer count rather than by actual usage, your cost-to-serve numbers are averages pretending to be measurements. Fix the attribution before making customer-level decisions, because acting on bad data produces bad outcomes.

The goal is not zero negative-margin customers. Some amount of negative margin is acceptable when deliberately chosen — a design partner who provides product feedback, a lighthouse customer who attracts others in their vertical, a customer in a strategic geography where you are building market presence. The goal is zero accidental negative-margin customers. Every customer who costs more than they pay should be a conscious, time-bounded, strategically justified decision — not a surprise you discover eighteen months later when the finance team finally attributes costs correctly.

## The Emotional Discipline

Firing a customer, repricing a relationship, or even engineering a cost-down fix all require emotional discipline that most founding teams have not developed. The instinct to keep every customer, to avoid difficult conversations, to hope the problem resolves itself — these instincts are natural and expensive. The companies that build sustainable AI businesses are the ones that learn to separate customer relationships from customer economics. You can value a customer as a partner while acknowledging that the current commercial terms do not work. You can respect a customer's needs while recognizing that serving them at a loss is not sustainable for either party.

The practical test is simple. For every negative-margin customer, ask: if this customer came to us today with their current usage pattern and offered their current price, would we accept the deal? If the answer is no, the relationship needs to change. The only question is how — fire, fix, or reprice — and the framework above gives you the decision criteria.

Once you have your customer portfolio margin-positive, the next leverage point is the models themselves. The gap between what you pay for inference today and what you could pay by choosing different models for different tasks is often wider than most teams realize. Model selection as a cost arbitrage lever is where engineering discipline meets vendor strategy — and it is the topic of the next subchapter.
