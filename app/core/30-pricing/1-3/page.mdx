# 30.1.3 — The Four Pricing Models and Why None of Them Are Obviously Right

Four pricing models are competing for dominance in AI products in 2026: per-seat, consumption-based, outcome-based, and hybrid. Each solves a real problem. Each creates a new one. The temptation is to find the "right" model and apply it — and that temptation will cost you, because the right model depends on your product type, your customer segment, your margin structure, and which risks you are willing to absorb versus which risks you push to your buyer. Understanding all four models and their trade-offs is a prerequisite for making the choice, which is why this subchapter maps the landscape before Chapter 3 goes deep on execution.

## Per-Seat: The Model Everyone Understands and AI Breaks

**Per-seat pricing** charges a fixed amount per user per month or per year, regardless of how much or how little each user consumes. It is the dominant model in traditional SaaS — Salesforce, Slack, Jira, and thousands of other products charge this way. Buyers understand it. Procurement teams can model it. Sales teams can forecast it. Per-seat pricing is the easiest model to sell, the easiest to implement, and the easiest to explain on a pricing page.

It is also the model most likely to destroy your margins in an AI product, for exactly the reasons the previous subchapter described. When every query has a real cost and usage varies by ten to a hundred times across users, a flat per-seat price creates a subsidy structure where light users fund heavy users. The per-seat model works when marginal cost is near zero. In AI, marginal cost is the entire game.

Harvey, the legal AI platform, prices on a per-seat basis — reportedly around $1,200 per lawyer per month with twelve-month commitments and minimum seat counts. Harvey makes this work because legal AI has specific characteristics that mitigate the heavy-user problem. The value delivered per interaction is extremely high — a single contract analysis that saves an attorney two hours of work is worth hundreds of dollars at partner billing rates. Usage variance is bounded by the nature of legal work — even the heaviest user runs a finite number of analyses per day because legal review is sequential, not parallelizable. And the price point is high enough that even heavy users generate positive margin at scale when the product uses model routing and caching effectively.

GitHub Copilot sits at the other end of the per-seat spectrum. At $10 per month for the Pro tier and $19 per user for Business, Copilot's pricing is low enough that Microsoft can absorb significant per-user cost variance. Reports from 2024 indicated that GitHub was losing money on Copilot's heaviest users, subsidized by Microsoft's strategic interest in developer ecosystem lock-in and the lighter users who generated completions infrequently. This is a viable strategy if you are Microsoft. It is not viable if you are a startup that needs positive unit economics to survive.

The per-seat model survives in AI only when one of three conditions holds: the price point is high enough to absorb usage variance, the usage variance itself is bounded by the nature of the work, or the vendor has a strategic reason to subsidize heavy users. For most AI products, none of these conditions hold, which is why per-seat pricing is declining as the default.

## Consumption-Based: The Model That Aligns Cost but Terrifies Buyers

**Consumption-based pricing** charges customers based on what they actually use. The charge metric varies — tokens, API calls, credits, compute minutes, analyses, documents processed — but the principle is constant: you pay for what you consume. Cloud infrastructure providers pioneered this model. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud charge by the hour, the gigabyte, the request. Model API providers adopted it directly: OpenAI charges per million tokens, Anthropic charges per million tokens, Google charges per character or token depending on the model.

Consumption pricing solves the heavy-user problem immediately. If a customer uses ten times more than average, they pay ten times more. Cost-to-serve and revenue stay aligned regardless of usage patterns, which means your gross margin is stable and predictable as a percentage even as absolute volumes fluctuate. Seventy-seven percent of the largest software companies have incorporated some form of consumption-based pricing, according to industry surveys from 2025, and the number is higher among AI-native companies.

The problem is on the buyer's side. Consumption pricing creates budget unpredictability for the customer. A finance team that approves $50,000 per month for an AI tool wants to know that $50,000 is the actual cost. If usage spikes because a project accelerates or a new team adopts the tool, the bill could land at $80,000 or $120,000 with no warning. A Zylo survey found that seventy-eight percent of IT leaders had experienced unexpected charges on software bills due to consumption-based or AI pricing, and that experience makes procurement teams hostile to pure consumption models.

The budget unpredictability problem is particularly acute in enterprise sales. Mid-market and enterprise buyers operate on annual budgets with quarterly review cycles. A consumption model that generates variable monthly invoices creates friction with finance teams, complicates forecasting, and gives procurement a reason to push for caps, commits, or fixed-fee alternatives. Your sales cycle lengthens because the buyer needs to model usage scenarios. Your deal size becomes uncertain because the buyer commits to a minimum rather than an expected amount. Your renewal becomes a negotiation rather than a confirmation because the buyer has twelve months of usage data showing exactly how much they spent versus how much value they received.

Pure consumption pricing works well for developer tools, API products, and infrastructure — contexts where the buyer is technical, usage is measurable, and the connection between consumption and value is direct. It works poorly for business applications where the buyer is non-technical, the budget is fixed, and the connection between tokens consumed and business value delivered is abstract.

## Outcome-Based: The Model That Sounds Perfect and Is Hardest to Execute

**Outcome-based pricing** charges customers when the AI achieves a defined result. Not per user. Not per token. Per outcome — a resolved support ticket, a completed analysis, a qualified lead, a successful transaction. The customer pays only when value is delivered, which makes the pricing story irresistible: you don't pay unless it works.

Sierra, the enterprise customer service AI company founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just twenty-one months using outcome-based pricing. Sierra charges per resolution — when their AI agent successfully handles a customer interaction without human escalation, the customer pays. When the agent can't resolve the issue and escalates to a human, the customer typically pays nothing. The model aligns incentives perfectly in theory: Sierra earns more only when their product delivers more value.

Intercom's Fin AI agent uses a similar approach at a different scale, charging $0.99 per resolution. The pricing is transparent, the metric is clear, and the buyer can calculate ROI directly: if a human agent costs $8 to handle a support ticket and Fin handles it for $0.99, the savings are immediate and quantifiable. Intercom reported that Fin reached meaningful revenue contribution within months of launching the per-resolution model.

The execution challenges are substantial, though, and they grow with the complexity of the outcome. The first challenge is defining what counts as a resolution. If the AI responds to a customer and the customer leaves the conversation without replying, is that a resolution or an abandonment? If the AI provides an answer but the customer calls back two days later about the same issue, was the first interaction truly resolved? Sierra and Intercom have invested heavily in resolution taxonomy — classifying outcomes into confirmed resolutions, assumed resolutions, partial resolutions, and escalations — but the definitions remain contested, and billing disputes are a real operational cost.

The second challenge is margin variability. Some outcomes are cheap to produce and some are expensive. A simple FAQ answer might cost $0.03 in inference. A complex multi-step resolution involving account lookup, policy checking, calculation, and response generation might cost $2.50. If you charge $0.99 per resolution regardless of complexity, simple resolutions subsidize complex ones — and you have recreated the heavy-user problem at the resolution level instead of the user level.

The third challenge is customer acquisition cost. Outcome-based pricing lowers the barrier to adoption because the buyer takes no risk — they pay only for results. But lower barriers mean slower initial revenue ramp. A per-seat deal generates predictable revenue from day one. An outcome-based deal generates revenue only as the customer's users begin triggering outcomes, which means your revenue lags your deployment cost by weeks or months.

Salesforce's experience with Agentforce illustrates the difficulty of getting outcome pricing right even when you have massive distribution. Agentforce initially launched with $2 per conversation pricing. The model drew criticism for being expensive and unpredictable — enterprise customers struggled to forecast costs when conversation volumes fluctuated with seasonality and campaign activity. Salesforce pivoted to a Flex Credits model in mid-2025, selling packs of 100,000 credits at $500 with each action consuming twenty credits. The shift from conversations to credits was essentially a move from outcome-based to consumption-based pricing, dressed in different language. It was an acknowledgment that pure outcome pricing created too much friction for enterprise procurement.

## Hybrid: The Model the Market Is Converging On

**Hybrid pricing** combines a fixed platform fee with a variable usage or outcome component. The platform fee provides revenue predictability for both the vendor and the buyer. The variable component aligns revenue with cost-to-serve and captures additional value from heavy users. Ninety-two percent of AI software companies now use some form of mixed pricing model, according to industry analysis from 2025, and hybrid approaches have surged from twenty-seven percent to forty-one percent of companies in just twelve months.

The typical hybrid structure in 2026 looks like this: a per-seat or per-team platform fee that covers basic access, a defined usage allocation included in the platform fee, and a per-unit charge for consumption above that allocation. The platform fee might be $150 per user per month including fifty AI analyses. Each additional analysis costs $1.25. The customer gets budget predictability up to the included allocation and pays proportionally if they exceed it.

Companies using hybrid models report the highest median growth rate at twenty-one percent, outperforming both pure subscription and pure consumption models. The margin advantage is meaningful. AI companies that adopted hybrid or consumption pricing saw gross margins roughly forty percent higher than those using flat per-seat pricing, according to the same industry analysis. The mechanism is straightforward: the platform fee covers your fixed costs and provides a margin floor, while the variable component ensures that high-usage customers contribute proportionally to their cost-to-serve.

The hybrid model is not without its own challenges. The first is complexity — you now have two dimensions to explain, two dimensions to model, and two dimensions for the buyer to negotiate. Pricing pages get more complicated. Sales conversations require more nuance. Procurement teams need to model both the base cost and the variable cost under multiple usage scenarios. The simplicity advantage of per-seat pricing is real, and every dimension you add to your pricing creates friction.

The second challenge is setting the included allocation correctly. Set it too high and you are back to the per-seat problem — heavy users consume everything within their allocation and you never capture the variable revenue that was supposed to align cost with revenue. Set it too low and you are functionally a consumption model with a platform tax — customers feel they are being double-charged, paying a base fee and then paying again for actual usage. The allocation needs to cover the usage of a typical customer while leaving room for heavy users to trigger the variable component. Getting this calibration right requires per-customer cost data that many companies have not yet built the infrastructure to collect.

The third challenge is managing the customer psychology of overages. In telecom, overage charges created decades of customer resentment and eventually drove the industry to unlimited plans. Software buyers carry that memory. When a customer's bill is $3,000 one month and $7,200 the next because of a usage spike, the variable component feels punitive even if it is economically fair. Companies that succeed with hybrid pricing invest in usage alerts, spending caps, and rollover credits that soften the overage experience without eliminating the cost alignment.

## Why No Single Model Dominates

The reason four pricing models coexist — and will continue to coexist through 2026 and beyond — is that each model optimizes for a different priority, and different products have different priorities.

Per-seat pricing optimizes for simplicity and revenue predictability. It works when your price point is high enough, your usage variance is bounded, or you have strategic reasons to absorb cost variance. Consumption pricing optimizes for cost alignment and margin stability. It works when your buyer is technical, your usage metric is transparent, and your value-per-unit is clearly quantifiable. Outcome-based pricing optimizes for customer alignment and adoption speed. It works when your outcomes are crisply definable, your production cost per outcome is predictable, and your buyer values results over budget certainty. Hybrid pricing optimizes for balance — revenue predictability from the platform fee, cost alignment from the variable component. It works for the broadest range of products, which is why it is winning market share.

The choice is not which model is "best." The choice is which trade-offs you can live with. And that choice reveals something fundamental about your business — what kind of company you are, what kind of customers you serve, and what kind of relationship you are building with the market. The pricing model is not just a revenue mechanism. It is a strategic signal, and understanding what that signal communicates is where the real pricing discipline begins.
