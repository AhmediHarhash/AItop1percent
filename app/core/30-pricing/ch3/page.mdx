# Chapter 3 — Pricing Models: Seats, Tokens, Outcomes, and Hybrids

There is no universally correct pricing model for AI products — but there are models that will quietly destroy your business if you pick them for the wrong product. Per-seat pricing is simple but fails to capture the value AI creates when one user generates a hundred queries and another generates ten thousand. Consumption pricing aligns cost with usage but terrifies enterprise buyers with unpredictable bills. Outcome-based pricing maximizes value capture but forces you to absorb cost variability you cannot control. Hybrid models are converging as the consensus approach in 2026, but the details — what the platform fee covers, how usage is metered, where the charge metric sits — matter more than the label. This chapter examines each model with real company cases, economic trade-offs, and the practical frameworks for choosing the model that fits your product, your market, and your margin requirements.

*The pricing model you choose is not just a billing decision. It is a signal to the market about what kind of business you are building — and it shapes every incentive your customers, your sales team, and your engineering organization will follow.*
