# 30.3.3 — Consumption-Based Pricing: Credits, Tokens, and the Blank-Check Problem

In the second quarter of 2025, a Series B AI analytics company made what its leadership called "the most data-driven pricing decision we have ever made." The company sold an AI-powered business intelligence tool to mid-market and enterprise customers. Their per-seat model was bleeding margin — the cost-to-serve analysis showed a twenty-two-to-one ratio between their heaviest and lightest accounts, and three enterprise customers were individually margin-negative. The fix seemed obvious. Switch to consumption-based pricing. Charge by the query. Align revenue with cost. Every industry analyst, every VC advisor, and every pricing consultant they talked to said the same thing: consumption is the future of AI pricing.

They launched the new model in July. By October, their enterprise pipeline had dropped forty-one percent. Not because prospects rejected the product. Not because a competitor undercut them. Because procurement could not approve the purchase.

## Why Procurement Froze

The company's consumption pricing was clean and transparent. They charged $0.08 per standard query and $0.35 per complex query, with volume discounts kicking in at fifty thousand queries per month. The pricing page was clear. The unit economics were sound. The problem was a question that every enterprise buyer asked on the first call: "What will this cost us per year?"

The honest answer was "it depends on how much you use it." That answer is death in enterprise procurement.

Enterprise buyers operate on annual budget cycles. A VP of Operations requesting budget for a new analytics tool needs to submit a purchase order with a defined annual cost. Their finance team needs to allocate that cost across quarters. Their procurement department needs to compare the cost against alternatives. Their CFO needs to approve the expenditure against a fixed budget. Every step in that chain requires a number — not a range, not a formula, not "it depends."

Under per-seat pricing, the number was simple. Two hundred users at $150 per month equals $360,000 per year. Procurement could process that in their sleep. Under consumption pricing, the number required the buyer to estimate their query volume, predict their mix of standard versus complex queries, model seasonal variation in usage, and arrive at a projected annual spend that nobody had confidence in. The estimate could be off by fifty percent in either direction. For a procurement team evaluated on budget accuracy, that uncertainty was a disqualifying risk.

The company learned a painful lesson: consumption pricing solves the vendor's margin problem by transferring the forecasting problem to the buyer. And many buyers will not accept that transfer.

## The Blank-Check Problem

This is the **Blank-Check Problem** — the single biggest barrier to consumption-based pricing in enterprise markets. When the buyer cannot predict what the product will cost, the purchase feels like writing a blank check. It does not matter that the per-unit price is low. It does not matter that consumption-based pricing is fairer. It does not matter that the buyer will probably spend less than they would under a per-seat model. The uncertainty itself is the obstacle.

The Blank-Check Problem is not theoretical. Industry surveys consistently show that unpredictable costs are the top concern enterprise IT leaders cite when evaluating consumption-based software. The concern is well-founded — many organizations have experienced unexpected charges when usage-based services spiked beyond their estimates. Cloud infrastructure is the cautionary tale. Every enterprise CTO has a story about an AWS bill that was three times the forecast because a development team spun up resources without governance. Consumption-based AI pricing triggers the same anxiety.

The problem is amplified for AI products because usage patterns are genuinely difficult to predict. With cloud infrastructure, an experienced operations team can estimate compute needs based on traffic projections and historical patterns. With AI products, usage depends on adoption velocity, feature discovery, workflow integration, and the emergent behavior of users who find new applications the product team never anticipated. A customer who budgets for ten thousand queries per month might hit forty thousand once they discover that the AI handles a use case nobody expected. The variance is not a forecasting failure. It is a feature of how AI products get adopted — gradually at first, then explosively as users integrate the tool into their daily workflow.

## Where Consumption Pricing Works

Consumption pricing is not inherently broken. It is the dominant model for specific market segments, and in those segments it works well. The pattern is clear: consumption works when the buyer is technical, the usage is predictable, and the purchase decision does not require enterprise procurement approval.

**Developer tools and APIs** are the natural home of consumption pricing. When you sell to developers, you sell to people who understand tokens, queries, and compute units. They can estimate their usage. They can set budgets and alerts. They can monitor consumption in real time. The Stripe model — pay for what you use, no commitments, transparent per-unit pricing — works for APIs because the buyer is the engineer, not the procurement department. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and every major model provider price their APIs on consumption because their buyers are developers who think in tokens.

**Data and analytics platforms** that serve data teams work similarly. Snowflake's consumption model succeeded because its buyers — data engineers and analytics leaders — could estimate their compute needs and monitor usage against budgets. The purchase decision was made by people who understood variable costs.

**Infrastructure services** work on consumption because the buyers have mature cost-management practices. DevOps teams running Kubernetes clusters or cloud compute have tooling, processes, and organizational muscle for managing variable infrastructure spend.

The common thread is buyer sophistication. Consumption pricing works when the person making the purchase decision understands variable cost models, has tools to monitor and control usage, and is comfortable with the uncertainty inherent in paying for what you use. When you sell to business buyers — VP of Operations, Head of Customer Support, Chief Revenue Officer — that sophistication is rare. These buyers want a number they can put in a budget. They want to know what the product costs before they sign the contract, not after.

## The Enterprise Adoption Curve Problem

Even when consumption pricing clears the procurement hurdle, it creates a subtler problem: the **Adoption Drag**. Under consumption pricing, every query costs money. Users know this. And when users know that their usage generates cost, they self-censor.

A customer support manager who deployed an AI agent on a per-seat model will encourage their team to use it for everything — the seat is already paid for, so every query is "free" at the margin. The same manager under a consumption model will think twice. They will create policies about which types of questions to send to the AI and which to handle manually. They will discourage experimentation. They will worry about the bill.

This self-censoring behavior suppresses adoption, which suppresses value realization, which suppresses expansion revenue, which suppresses retention. The customer who carefully rations their AI usage never discovers the second and third use cases that would have made the product indispensable. They never reach the adoption depth where switching costs make churn unlikely. They remain in the shallow end of the value pool, where the product is useful but not essential — and "useful but not essential" is the exact positioning that leads to churn at the next budget review.

The Adoption Drag is particularly damaging for AI products because AI value compounds with usage. The more a team uses an AI tool, the more they discover what it can do, the more they integrate it into their workflows, and the more essential it becomes. Consumption pricing creates friction at exactly the point where you need frictionless expansion. Per-seat pricing, for all its margin problems, gets this right — once the seat is purchased, there is zero marginal cost to use it more.

## The Billing Complexity Tax

Consumption pricing also introduces operational complexity that per-seat pricing avoids. You need metering infrastructure to track usage in real time. You need billing systems that can calculate variable invoices. You need dashboards that show customers their consumption. You need alerting systems that warn customers before they exceed budget thresholds. You need dispute resolution processes for customers who claim they were charged for queries they did not make. You need revenue recognition processes that handle variable monthly amounts.

This is the **Billing Complexity Tax** — the internal cost of operating a consumption model. For a company with fifty customers, the tax is manageable. For a company with five thousand customers across multiple pricing tiers, geographies, and contract types, the billing system becomes a product in itself. The engineering team that maintains the metering and billing infrastructure is not building features. The finance team that reconciles consumption-based invoices is not doing strategic analysis. The support team that handles billing inquiries is not solving product problems.

The Billing Complexity Tax is real operational cost that rarely appears in the consumption-pricing pitch. When a pricing consultant recommends switching from per-seat to consumption, they model the margin improvement. They rarely model the cost of building and operating the metering infrastructure, the revenue recognition complexity, the additional support load, or the engineering bandwidth diverted from product development.

## The Spectrum Between Pure Per-Seat and Pure Consumption

The reality of 2026 is that neither pure per-seat nor pure consumption works well for most AI products. Pure per-seat ignores the cost structure. Pure consumption ignores the buyer's need for predictability. The market has converged on a middle ground: hybrid models that combine a predictable base with a usage-based component.

But before you can design a hybrid model, you need to solve the fundamental abstraction problem. Raw tokens — the unit that model providers charge you — are meaningless to customers. No VP of Customer Support knows what a token is, wants to learn what a token is, or should need to learn what a token is. Telling a business buyer that a query costs 3,200 input tokens and 800 output tokens at $0.003 per thousand tokens is the fastest way to lose a deal. The unit of measurement that your provider uses internally cannot be the unit of measurement you present to customers.

This abstraction gap is where credits come in. A well-designed credit system takes the complexity of token-level pricing and converts it into a unit that customers can understand, budget for, and manage. But designing a credit system that actually works — one that is simple enough for a sales conversation, accurate enough for margin protection, and flexible enough for diverse usage patterns — is its own discipline. The next subchapter examines how to build a credit system that customers can actually understand, and how the companies getting it right in 2026 are using credits as the bridge between consumption economics and enterprise buying behavior.
