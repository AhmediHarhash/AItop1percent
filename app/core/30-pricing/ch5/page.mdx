# Chapter 5 — Enterprise Contracts, SLAs, and the Negotiation

Enterprise AI contracts are not SaaS contracts with a different product name. They are fundamentally different agreements because the underlying economics are fundamentally different. Quality is probabilistic — you cannot guarantee a language model will never hallucinate, only that it will hallucinate within acceptable bounds. Costs are variable — a customer who doubles their usage doubles your cost to serve. Model providers can change their pricing with thirty days notice, restructuring your margins overnight. And when AI replaces human labor, the contract triggers political resistance that no traditional software deal ever faced. This chapter teaches the contract mechanics, SLA design, discount strategy, procurement navigation, and risk allocation structures specific to AI products — where the contract is not just a legal document but the place where pricing strategy meets budget reality, organizational politics, and regulatory compliance.
