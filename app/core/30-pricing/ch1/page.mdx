# Chapter 1 — Why AI Pricing Is a Different Discipline

AI breaks the foundational assumption that made SaaS pricing simple: the idea that serving one more customer costs you almost nothing. In AI, every query burns compute, every customer has a different cost-to-serve, and the entire pricing landscape is shifting beneath your feet as model providers cut prices, competitors experiment with outcome-based models, and enterprise buyers demand proof of value before renewal. This chapter establishes why AI pricing is a distinct discipline, introduces the four pricing models competing for dominance in 2026, confronts the LLMflation Paradox, and builds the AI Pricing Stack — the seven-layer framework that structures every pricing decision in this section.
