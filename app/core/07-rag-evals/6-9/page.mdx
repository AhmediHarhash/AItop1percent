# 6.9 — Human Evaluation Protocols for RAG Quality

In June 2024, a medical information retrieval system launched with automated evaluation showing 92% faithfulness and 88% correctness scores. Six weeks post-launch, physicians reported that answers often felt "off," even when technically correct. The company commissioned a human evaluation study with domain expert annotators. The study revealed that 31% of answers, while faithful to retrieved documents and semantically correct, were clinically misleading due to missing context, inappropriate generalization, or failure to highlight critical caveats. Automated metrics missed these issues because they measured narrow properties like faithfulness and semantic match, not clinical appropriateness. The findings led to a product recall, a six-month retooling of the system with human oversight, and the implementation of mandatory human evaluation protocols before any future releases. The company learned that human evaluation is not optional for high-stakes applications. Automated metrics provide scale, but humans provide judgment that machines cannot replicate.

You built automated evaluation pipelines with retrieval metrics, LLM judges, and faithfulness scorers. These tools are essential for continuous monitoring and rapid iteration. But they are not sufficient. Automated metrics measure narrow properties and miss nuances that matter to users. Human evaluation provides the ground truth, captures holistic quality, and surfaces issues that automated methods overlook. Understanding how to design human evaluation protocols, measure inter-annotator agreement, choose rating scales, and balance cost with coverage is essential for building RAG systems that meet real-world quality standards.

## Humans as the Gold Standard

Human evaluation is the gold standard because humans are the ultimate judges of quality. Users are humans, and their satisfaction depends on qualities that automated metrics struggle to capture: clarity, appropriateness, trustworthiness, and usefulness. Humans assess these qualities holistically, integrating context, prior knowledge, and expectations in ways that models cannot. When automated metrics and human judgment disagree, human judgment is the ground truth.

Humans excel at detecting subtle issues. They recognize when an answer is technically correct but misleading, when a citation is accurate but not the most authoritative source, when an answer is faithful but unhelpful. Humans understand domain-specific nuances that general-purpose models miss. A doctor can evaluate whether a medical summary appropriately qualifies recommendations. A lawyer can assess whether a legal answer acknowledges relevant exceptions. A financial analyst can judge whether a market summary emphasizes the right factors. Domain expertise enables evaluation that automated methods cannot replicate.

Humans also provide richer feedback than automated metrics. Automated methods produce scores: 0.87 faithfulness, 0.92 correctness. Humans provide explanations: "This answer is correct but omits an important safety warning," or "This citation is accurate but outdated; newer guidance exists." Explanations are actionable. They tell you not just that something is wrong but why it is wrong and how to fix it. This diagnostic value makes human evaluation essential for debugging and continuous improvement.

However, human evaluation is expensive and slow. Annotators require training, ongoing management, and fair compensation. Annotation takes time, especially for complex tasks requiring domain expertise. A single evaluation might take minutes or even hours for lengthy documents or nuanced judgments. Scaling human evaluation to cover all production traffic is impractical. The challenge is to use human evaluation strategically, maximizing its value while keeping costs manageable.

## Annotation Guidelines for RAG Quality

Effective human evaluation requires clear, comprehensive annotation guidelines. Guidelines define what annotators should evaluate, how to make judgments, and how to handle edge cases. Without guidelines, annotators interpret tasks inconsistently, producing noisy data that is difficult to aggregate and act on.

Start by defining the evaluation dimensions. What aspects of RAG quality are you measuring? Common dimensions include faithfulness, correctness, relevance, clarity, completeness, and safety. For each dimension, provide a clear definition. For example: "Faithfulness measures whether the answer is supported by the retrieved context. An answer is faithful if every claim can be traced to the context. An answer is unfaithful if it adds information not in the context or contradicts the context."

Specify the rating scale for each dimension. Options include binary scales, Likert scales, and comparative scales. Binary scales, such as faithful or unfaithful, are simple but lose nuance. Likert scales, such as one to five or zero to one, capture degrees of quality. Comparative scales ask annotators to compare two outputs and choose the better one. Choose the scale that balances simplicity, nuance, and task requirements. For most RAG evaluation tasks, a five-point Likert scale or a zero-to-one continuous scale works well.

Provide examples for each level of the scale. Show what a score of one looks like, what a score of three looks like, and what a five looks like. Use real or realistic examples from your domain. For faithfulness, show a completely faithful answer, a partially faithful answer, and an unfaithful answer. Include explanations: "This answer scores five because every claim is directly supported by the context. This answer scores three because most claims are supported, but it adds one unsupported detail. This answer scores one because it contradicts the context."

Address edge cases explicitly. What if the context is ambiguous? What if the answer is correct but uses different terminology than the context? What if the answer is incomplete but not incorrect? Guidelines should cover these scenarios. For example: "If the context is ambiguous and the answer makes a reasonable interpretation, do not penalize it. If the answer uses synonyms or paraphrases the context, consider it faithful as long as the meaning is preserved. If the answer is incomplete but everything it says is correct, score it as partially correct rather than incorrect."

Include instructions on what to ignore. Should annotators consider answer length, tone, or formatting, or focus only on content quality? Clarify this in the guidelines. For example: "Focus on whether the answer is faithful and correct. Ignore formatting, punctuation, and stylistic choices unless they affect meaning." Reducing the scope of evaluation to essential dimensions simplifies the task and improves consistency.

Finally, provide a process for handling uncertainty. Annotators will encounter cases they are unsure how to score. Guidelines should specify what to do: flag the case for review, leave a comment explaining the uncertainty, or use a neutral score. Some systems include a "cannot evaluate" option for cases that fall outside the scope of the task. Giving annotators an outlet for uncertainty prevents forced judgments that introduce noise.

## Inter-Annotator Agreement

Inter-annotator agreement measures how consistently different annotators score the same outputs. High agreement indicates clear guidelines, adequate training, and a well-defined task. Low agreement indicates ambiguity, insufficient training, or inherent task difficulty. Measuring and improving agreement is essential for producing reliable evaluation data.

Agreement is measured using metrics like percent agreement, Cohen's kappa, or Krippendorff's alpha. Percent agreement is the simplest: the fraction of cases where annotators assign the same score. For example, if two annotators agree on 80 out of 100 cases, percent agreement is 80%. Percent agreement is intuitive but does not account for agreement by chance. Two annotators randomly selecting scores might agree 20% of the time just by luck.

Cohen's kappa adjusts for chance agreement. It compares observed agreement to the agreement expected if annotators scored randomly, producing a value between negative one and one. A kappa of one indicates perfect agreement. A kappa of zero indicates no agreement beyond chance. A kappa above 0.6 is considered substantial agreement. Above 0.8 is near-perfect agreement. Below 0.4 indicates poor agreement and suggests problems with the task or guidelines.

Krippendorff's alpha is a more general metric that handles multiple annotators, different scale types, and missing data. It is the most robust agreement metric but also the most complex to compute. For most RAG evaluation tasks, Cohen's kappa for pairs of annotators or Fleiss' kappa for multiple annotators suffices. Use percent agreement for quick checks and kappa for rigorous measurement.

When agreement is low, diagnose the cause. Review cases where annotators disagree. Are they interpreting the task differently? Are guidelines unclear? Are some cases genuinely ambiguous? Discuss disagreements with annotators and refine guidelines based on their feedback. Retrain annotators on updated guidelines and remeasure agreement. Iterate until agreement reaches an acceptable level, typically above 0.6 or 0.7 kappa.

Accept that some tasks have inherently low agreement. Evaluating qualities like "helpfulness" or "clarity" involves subjective judgment, and even well-trained annotators will disagree. For subjective tasks, collect annotations from multiple annotators and aggregate scores by averaging or voting. Aggregation smooths out individual variation and produces more stable scores. Alternatively, use majority voting, where the final label is the one most annotators chose. Aggregation and voting leverage the wisdom of crowds to mitigate individual biases.

## Rating Scales: Binary, Likert, Comparative

Choosing the right rating scale affects the quality and usability of human evaluation data. Binary scales are simple, Likert scales capture nuance, and comparative scales reduce ambiguity. Each scale has strengths and weaknesses, and the right choice depends on your evaluation goals and resources.

Binary scales ask annotators to make yes-or-no judgments. Is the answer faithful? Yes or no. Is it correct? Yes or no. Binary scales are fast and easy to apply, making them suitable for high-volume annotation. They produce clear, actionable labels for training models or filtering outputs. However, they lose nuance. An answer that is mostly faithful but has one minor unsupported claim is forced into the "no" bucket, discarding information about degree of faithfulness. Binary scales work well when the distinction is clear and when partial credit is not needed.

Likert scales ask annotators to rate quality on a multi-point scale, such as one to five. For example: one means completely unfaithful, two means mostly unfaithful, three means neutral or mixed, four means mostly faithful, five means completely faithful. Likert scales capture degrees of quality and allow partial credit. They are more informative than binary scales and better suited for complex evaluations. However, they are slower to apply and introduce ambiguity. Annotators might interpret the midpoint differently, and the distance between scale points is subjective. Clear definitions and examples for each point reduce ambiguity.

Continuous scales, such as zero to one, ask annotators to assign a score on a continuum. Continuous scales provide maximum granularity and flexibility. They are well-suited for tasks where quality varies smoothly, such as semantic similarity or relevance. However, continuous scales are cognitively demanding. Annotators must decide not just whether an answer is faithful but how faithful it is on a 100-point scale. This precision is often unnecessary and can introduce noise. Use continuous scales when fine-grained scoring is needed and when annotators can make consistent judgments at that level of granularity.

Comparative scales, also called pairwise comparisons, ask annotators to compare two outputs and choose which is better. For example: "Which answer is more faithful to the context, Answer A or Answer B?" Comparative scales reduce ambiguity because annotators do not need to assign absolute scores, only to make relative judgments. Humans are often better at comparing than rating in absolute terms. Comparative scales are useful for ranking outputs or for training preference models. However, they require more annotations to cover the same number of outputs because each output must be compared to multiple others. Use comparative scales when ranking is the goal or when absolute scoring is too subjective.

## Sampling Strategies

Human evaluation cannot cover all production traffic, so you must sample strategically. The sampling strategy determines which outputs are evaluated and affects the representativeness and usefulness of evaluation data.

Random sampling selects outputs uniformly at random. It is the simplest strategy and ensures unbiased coverage. Random sampling is appropriate when you want to estimate overall system quality or when you do not have strong priors about which outputs are problematic. However, random sampling might miss rare but important failure modes. If only 2% of outputs are hallucinated, you need to evaluate hundreds of samples to encounter enough hallucinations to analyze.

Stratified sampling divides outputs into strata, such as query types, user segments, or time periods, and samples from each stratum. This strategy ensures coverage of different conditions and helps identify where the system performs well or poorly. For example, you might stratify by query complexity, evaluating simple, medium, and complex queries separately. Stratified sampling provides more actionable insights than random sampling and is the preferred approach for most evaluation tasks.

Targeted sampling selects outputs flagged by heuristics or automated metrics as potentially problematic. For example, sample outputs with low automated faithfulness scores, long response times, or user reports of issues. Targeted sampling focuses human effort on cases most likely to reveal problems, maximizing the diagnostic value of limited annotation budget. However, it does not provide unbiased estimates of overall quality. Use targeted sampling for debugging and root cause analysis, not for measuring aggregate metrics.

Temporal sampling evaluates outputs from different time periods to detect regressions or improvements. Sample outputs before and after a model update, prompt change, or data refresh. Compare metrics across time periods to assess the impact of changes. Temporal sampling is essential for validating that improvements actually help and that deployments do not introduce regressions. It is a critical component of continuous evaluation.

User-driven sampling evaluates outputs that users flagged as problematic. Users provide valuable signal about real-world quality issues. Analyzing flagged outputs reveals failure modes that automated metrics miss and that might not appear in random samples. However, user flags are biased toward negative cases and do not reflect overall quality. Combine user-driven sampling with random or stratified sampling to get a complete picture.

## Cost and Time of Human Evaluation

Human evaluation is the most expensive component of the RAG evaluation stack. Understanding costs and managing time effectively is essential for scaling evaluation without breaking budgets.

Cost depends on annotator expertise, task complexity, and volume. General crowdworkers on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk cost a few dollars per hour. Trained annotators with domain expertise cost tens to hundreds of dollars per hour. Tasks requiring deep expertise, such as evaluating medical summaries or legal documents, require domain experts who command professional rates. Task complexity affects time per annotation. Simple binary judgments might take seconds. Complex multi-dimensional evaluations might take minutes. Volume multiplies time. Evaluating one thousand outputs at one minute per output requires over sixteen hours of annotator time.

A typical cost model for RAG evaluation might look like this: hiring domain experts at fifty dollars per hour, with each evaluation taking three minutes, results in a cost of 2.50 dollars per evaluation. Evaluating one thousand outputs costs 2,500 dollars. Evaluating ten thousand outputs costs 25,000 dollars. These costs add up quickly, making exhaustive human evaluation impractical for high-volume systems.

To manage costs, focus human evaluation on high-value use cases. Use automated metrics for routine monitoring and broad coverage. Use human evaluation for ground truth creation, calibration of automated metrics, and investigation of specific issues. Sample rather than evaluating everything. Stratified or targeted sampling provides actionable insights with fewer annotations than random sampling. Invest in clear guidelines and annotator training to improve efficiency and reduce the need for rework.

Time is also a constraint. Recruiting, training, and managing annotators takes weeks. Running large-scale annotations takes days or weeks depending on volume and annotator availability. If you need evaluation results quickly to make a deployment decision, time is more limiting than cost. Build an annotator pool in advance, maintain ongoing relationships, and run continuous evaluation rather than one-off studies. Continuous evaluation spreads cost and time over the product lifecycle and ensures you always have up-to-date quality data.

## When Human Evaluation Is Required Versus Optional

Human evaluation is required in several scenarios. It is optional in others. Understanding when to invest in human evaluation helps you allocate resources effectively.

Human evaluation is required for building ground truth datasets. Automated metrics need gold labels for calibration and validation. Without human-labeled data, you cannot measure whether automated metrics are accurate. Human evaluation is also required for high-stakes deployments. If your system provides medical advice, legal guidance, or financial recommendations, you must validate quality with domain experts before launch. Automated metrics are insufficient for ensuring safety and trust in these contexts.

Human evaluation is required for detecting novel failure modes. Automated metrics measure predefined properties. They miss issues you did not anticipate. Human evaluators catch unexpected problems because they assess outputs holistically. When deploying a new feature, entering a new domain, or serving a new user population, run human evaluation to uncover blind spots.

Human evaluation is optional for routine monitoring when automated metrics are well-calibrated. If your LLM judges correlate highly with human judgment and you have dashboards tracking automated metrics continuously, you can reduce the frequency of human evaluation. Run human evaluation periodically, such as monthly or quarterly, to validate that automated metrics remain accurate. Use automated metrics for day-to-day monitoring and alerting.

Human evaluation is optional for low-stakes applications where errors have minimal impact. If your RAG system provides general knowledge answers or casual recommendations, the cost of occasional errors is low. Automated metrics suffice for ensuring the system meets quality thresholds. Human evaluation adds value but is not essential for safety or trust. Invest human effort where the stakes are highest and the impact is greatest.

## Practical Implementation

Implementing human evaluation requires infrastructure for task assignment, annotation, review, and data management. You need platforms or tools for presenting tasks to annotators, collecting responses, and storing results. You need workflows for onboarding and training annotators, ensuring quality, and resolving disagreements.

Use annotation platforms like Label Studio, Prodigy, or custom tools built on frameworks like React or Streamlit. These platforms present query-context-answer triples to annotators, collect ratings and comments, and export data for analysis. Choose platforms that support your rating scales, allow customization, and integrate with your evaluation pipeline. Good tooling reduces friction and improves annotator efficiency.

Onboard annotators with training sessions that cover guidelines, provide examples, and allow practice. Measure agreement on a gold set of pre-labeled examples. Annotators who achieve high agreement are ready for production tasks. Those who struggle receive additional training or are not retained. Ongoing training and feedback maintain annotator quality over time.

Implement quality control mechanisms. Inject gold examples with known labels into annotation tasks and measure annotator accuracy. Annotators who consistently label gold examples incorrectly are flagged for retraining or removal. Use redundant annotation, where multiple annotators evaluate the same outputs, to detect low-quality annotators and to produce more reliable scores through aggregation.

Collect rich feedback beyond scores. Ask annotators to explain their ratings, highlight problematic passages, or suggest improvements. Explanations provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative scores. They help you understand failure modes and guide optimization. Store feedback in a structured format that enables analysis and retrieval.

## Moving Forward

Human evaluation is the gold standard for RAG quality assessment. Humans provide holistic judgment, detect subtle issues, and offer actionable feedback that automated metrics miss. Effective human evaluation requires clear annotation guidelines, measurement of inter-annotator agreement, thoughtful choice of rating scales, and strategic sampling. It is expensive and slow, so use it where it provides the most value: ground truth creation, high-stakes validation, and uncovering novel failure modes.

Human evaluation and automated evaluation are complementary. Use automated metrics for scale, speed, and continuous monitoring. Use human evaluation for accuracy, depth, and trust. Together, they form a complete evaluation stack that enables you to build, deploy, and improve RAG systems that meet real-world quality standards. With the full stack in place, you can measure retrieval quality, context relevance, faithfulness, correctness, hallucination rates, citation accuracy, and holistic user satisfaction. You can diagnose failures, validate improvements, and deploy with confidence.
