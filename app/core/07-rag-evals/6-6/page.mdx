# 6.6 — Hallucination Detection in RAG Outputs

In October 2024, a legal document summarization tool was removed from production after lawyers discovered fabricated case citations in multiple summaries. The system had been live for four months and processed over 12,000 documents. When auditors reviewed outputs, they found that 8% of summaries contained hallucinated information: case names that did not exist, dates that were incorrect, and precedents that were fabricated. The hallucinations were subtle and plausible, making them difficult to spot without verification. One fabricated citation nearly made it into a court filing before a paralegal flagged it. The company faced legal exposure, client trust evaporated, and the product was shelved indefinitely. The engineering team had measured faithfulness and correctness on synthetic test data, but they had never systematically tested for hallucinations on production outputs. They learned that hallucination detection is not optional. It is a fundamental requirement for any RAG system deployed in high-stakes domains.

You built a RAG system to reduce hallucinations by grounding generation in retrieved context. But retrieval does not eliminate hallucinations. It changes their nature and reduces their frequency, but models still fabricate information, sometimes in subtle and dangerous ways. Hallucination detection measures how often your system generates content that is not supported by evidence or contradicts known facts. Understanding the types of hallucinations, how to detect them, and their business impact is essential for deploying safe, trustworthy RAG systems.

## Types of RAG Hallucination

Hallucinations in RAG outputs fall into two broad categories: intrinsic hallucinations, which contradict the retrieved context, and extrinsic hallucinations, which add information beyond the context. Both types are failures, but they have different causes and require different detection methods.

Intrinsic hallucinations contradict the provided context. The context says one thing, and the generated answer says something different. For example, the context states "the product ships within five to seven business days," and the model generates "the product ships within three to five business days." The generated statement contradicts the context. Intrinsic hallucinations are often caused by model confusion, misreading, or blending information from multiple documents. They are particularly dangerous because they directly misrepresent the evidence provided.

Extrinsic hallucinations add information that is not present in the context. The generated answer includes claims, details, or facts that the context does not mention. For example, the context describes a product's features but does not mention pricing, and the model generates "the product costs 49 dollars." The pricing claim is not supported by the context. Extrinsic hallucinations are caused by the model drawing on pretrained knowledge, making plausible inferences, or filling gaps when context is incomplete. They are dangerous because they blend grounded and fabricated information, making it hard for users to distinguish fact from fiction.

A subtler form of extrinsic hallucination is hedging or probability language not present in the context. The context states a fact definitively, but the model adds qualifiers like "typically," "usually," or "in most cases." For example, the context says "returns are accepted within 30 days," and the model generates "returns are typically accepted within 30 days." The addition of "typically" changes the meaning and is not supported by the text. While this seems minor, it introduces uncertainty where none exists and can mislead users.

Another form is fabricated details within otherwise accurate summaries. The model correctly summarizes 90% of the content but adds one fabricated detail. For example, a medical summary correctly lists symptoms and diagnosis but adds a treatment recommendation not mentioned in the source document. Users trust the summary because most of it is accurate, making the hallucinated detail more likely to be accepted uncritically. This mixed-quality output is one of the most dangerous forms of hallucination.

## Detection Methods

Detecting hallucinations requires checking generated content against both the retrieved context and external knowledge. Different detection methods target different hallucination types. Effective hallucination detection uses multiple methods in combination, providing layered defenses against fabricated content.

Context-based detection checks whether claims in the generated answer are supported by the retrieved context. This method detects both intrinsic hallucinations, which contradict context, and extrinsic hallucinations, which add unsupported information. Context-based detection is similar to faithfulness evaluation. You decompose the answer into claims, then verify each claim against the context using natural language inference models, LLM judges, or semantic similarity. Claims that contradict or are absent from the context are flagged as hallucinations. Context-based detection is the primary defense for RAG systems because it directly checks whether the model is using the evidence provided.

Knowledge-based detection checks whether claims in the generated answer align with external knowledge sources. This method detects factual errors that slip through context-based checks, such as when the context itself is wrong or when the model adds information from pretrained knowledge. Knowledge-based detection requires access to trusted knowledge bases, databases, or APIs. For example, if the generated answer claims a specific date, you can verify the date against a calendar API or historical database. If the answer names a person, you can check whether that person exists in a knowledge graph. Knowledge-based detection is more expensive and limited in scope but provides an additional layer of verification for critical claims.

Uncertainty-based detection uses model confidence signals to flag potential hallucinations. Models often assign lower probabilities to hallucinated content because it is less consistent with the context. You can extract token-level probabilities or use model attention patterns to identify uncertain claims. High uncertainty suggests the model is guessing or fabricating. Uncertainty-based detection is fast and does not require external verification, but it is noisy. Models are sometimes confident in hallucinations and uncertain in correct content. Uncertainty signals are useful as a filter but not as a definitive hallucination detector.

Consistency-based detection generates multiple answers to the same query and checks for consistency. If the model produces different answers across runs, it suggests the answers are not well-grounded. Hallucinated content tends to vary more across generations because it is not anchored in the context. Consistent content is more likely to be faithful. You can generate several answers, compare them, and flag inconsistent claims as potential hallucinations. Consistency-based detection is expensive because it requires multiple inference calls, but it is effective for high-stakes applications where verification is critical.

## Automated Hallucination Scoring

Automated hallucination scoring provides a scalable way to monitor hallucination rates in production. You compute hallucination scores for generated answers using one or more detection methods, then aggregate scores to track overall system quality. Automated scoring enables continuous monitoring, regression detection, and rapid iteration.

One approach is to use an LLM as a hallucination judge. You prompt the LLM with the retrieved context and the generated answer, then ask it to identify hallucinations. The prompt might say: "Read the context and the answer. Identify any claims in the answer that are not supported by the context or that contradict the context. List each hallucinated claim and explain why it is unsupported." The LLM outputs a list of hallucinations and explanations. You can count the number of hallucinations or compute a binary score indicating whether any hallucinations are present. LLM judges are flexible and handle complex reasoning, but they are expensive and sometimes miss subtle hallucinations.

Another approach is to use natural language inference models to classify claims as entailed, contradicted, or neutral. Claims that are contradicted are intrinsic hallucinations. Claims that are neutral might be extrinsic hallucinations, though some neutral claims are acceptable inferences. You threshold NLI probabilities to flag claims as hallucinations. NLI models are faster and cheaper than LLM judges but less flexible and less accurate on complex cases. Combining NLI models with LLM judges provides a good balance of speed, cost, and accuracy.

You can also train a dedicated hallucination detection model. Collect a dataset of answers labeled with hallucinations, train a classifier to predict whether an answer contains hallucinations, and deploy it as a real-time hallucination detector. A custom model can be optimized for your domain and data, achieving better accuracy than general-purpose methods. However, building and maintaining a custom model requires significant investment in data collection, training infrastructure, and ongoing updates. This approach is worthwhile for large-scale systems where hallucination detection is business-critical.

Hallucination scores can be binary, indicating whether any hallucination is present, or continuous, indicating the severity or frequency of hallucinations. Binary scores are easy to interpret and threshold but lose nuance. Continuous scores, such as the fraction of claims that are hallucinated or a severity-weighted score, provide richer signal. For example, you might score an answer as 0.9 if 10% of claims are mildly extrinsic hallucinations and 0.5 if 50% of claims are intrinsic hallucinations. Choose the scoring method based on your application requirements and how you plan to use the scores.

## The Challenge of Detecting Subtle Hallucinations

Subtle hallucinations are the hardest to detect. They blend seamlessly with factual content, sound plausible, and require deep knowledge to verify. A fabricated case citation in a legal summary looks like any other citation. A hallucinated treatment recommendation in a medical summary sounds like something a doctor might say. A made-up product feature in a technical description fits with the other features. Detecting these hallucinations requires domain expertise, external verification, or very strong models.

One challenge is plausibility. Hallucinated content often sounds correct because models generate text that is coherent and consistent with their training data. A hallucinated date might fit the time period discussed. A fabricated name might follow naming conventions. A made-up statistic might be in a reasonable range. Plausibility makes hallucinations hard to spot by reading alone. Users trust plausible content, and automated detectors struggle to distinguish plausible hallucinations from factual statements without external verification.

Another challenge is partial truth. A hallucination might mix true and false elements. For example, a real case citation with the wrong date, or a real product feature with an incorrect specification. Partial truth is harder to detect than complete fabrication because part of the claim is verifiable. Automated detectors might flag the claim as supported because they match the true part and miss the false part. Detecting partial truth requires fine-grained claim decomposition and verification of each component.

Context ambiguity also makes detection difficult. When the context is vague or incomplete, it is hard to determine whether a claim is a reasonable inference or a hallucination. For example, the context says "the product is popular," and the model generates "the product has sold over one million units." Is this a hallucination or a reasonable interpretation of "popular"? The answer depends on your standards for inference. Strict standards flag it as a hallucination because the context does not specify sales numbers. Lenient standards treat it as acceptable inference. Defining these standards clearly is essential for consistent detection.

Finally, detection methods themselves are imperfect. LLM judges sometimes miss hallucinations, especially when they are subtle or when the judge model is weaker than the generation model. NLI models struggle with complex reasoning and long contexts. Human annotators miss hallucinations when they lack domain knowledge or when hallucinations are plausible. No single method is foolproof. Layering multiple detection methods provides better coverage, but some hallucinations will still slip through. The goal is to reduce hallucination rates to acceptable levels, not to eliminate them entirely, which is often impractical.

## Real-World Hallucination Rates and Business Impact

Hallucination rates vary widely across systems, domains, and deployment contexts. Understanding typical rates and their business impact helps you set realistic targets and justify investment in hallucination detection.

Research studies on open-domain question answering find hallucination rates ranging from 5% to 30%, depending on the model, retrieval quality, and evaluation method. High-quality retrieval and strong generation models achieve rates on the lower end. Weaker retrieval or models achieve rates on the higher end. In specialized domains like medicine or law, where precision is critical and errors are costly, even 5% is often unacceptable. In general knowledge domains where users can tolerate occasional errors, 10% to 15% might be acceptable.

The business impact of hallucinations depends on the application and the cost of errors. In customer support, a hallucinated answer might frustrate a user but is unlikely to cause serious harm. Users can ask follow-up questions or escalate to a human agent. The cost is a degraded user experience and potential churn. In medical or legal applications, a hallucinated answer can lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment, legal liability, or regulatory penalties. The cost is measured in lives, lawsuits, and lost licenses. In financial applications, hallucinations can lead to incorrect trades, compliance violations, or fraud. The cost is monetary loss and regulatory risk.

Hallucinations also erode trust. Users who encounter fabricated information lose confidence in the system, even if most outputs are correct. Trust is hard to build and easy to destroy. A single high-profile hallucination can undo months of positive user experiences. In enterprise applications, trust is especially critical because decisions are made based on system outputs. If users cannot trust the system, they will not use it, regardless of how good it is most of the time. Measuring and reducing hallucination rates is essential for building and maintaining user trust.

From a product perspective, hallucination rates inform go or no-go decisions. Before deploying a RAG system, you need to measure hallucination rates on representative test data and compare them to acceptable thresholds. If rates are too high, you delay deployment and invest in improvements. If rates are acceptable, you deploy with monitoring in place to catch regressions. Post-deployment, you track hallucination rates continuously and alert when they exceed thresholds. This discipline prevents catastrophic failures and ensures your system operates within safety margins.

## Practical Mitigation Strategies

Reducing hallucination rates requires a combination of retrieval improvements, generation improvements, and output filtering. No single technique eliminates hallucinations, but layering multiple strategies reduces rates significantly.

Improving retrieval quality is the first line of defense. Better retrieval provides the model with more relevant, complete context, reducing the need to fill gaps with pretrained knowledge. Invest in query understanding, embedding models, reranking, and hybrid search. Ensure retrieved documents are up-to-date and accurate. Monitor retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and context relevance. When retrieval provides strong evidence, generation is more likely to be faithful and less likely to hallucinate.

Prompt engineering reduces hallucination by instructing the model to stay grounded. Explicitly tell the model to only use information from the provided context and to avoid adding information from pretrained knowledge. Instruct the model to admit when it does not know the answer rather than guessing. Provide examples of good and bad answers, showing what faithfulness looks like. Well-designed prompts can reduce hallucination rates by 20% to 50%, making them one of the highest-leverage interventions.

Model selection also matters. Some models hallucinate more than others. Instruction-tuned models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback often hallucinate less because they are optimized for helpfulness and truthfulness. Larger models generally hallucinate less than smaller models, though they are more expensive. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data with faithfulness as an objective can further reduce hallucinations. Evaluate multiple models on hallucination metrics and choose the one that best balances quality, cost, and latency.

Output filtering catches hallucinations before they reach users. After generation, run hallucination detection on the answer. If hallucinations are detected, you can reject the answer, remove the hallucinated claims, or flag the answer for human review. Output filtering adds latency and cost but provides an additional safety layer. In high-stakes applications, filtering is essential. In lower-stakes applications, filtering a sample of outputs provides monitoring without adding latency to every request.

Finally, human-in-the-loop workflows allow humans to review and edit generated answers before they are shown to users. This approach is slow and expensive but provides the highest quality. Human reviewers catch hallucinations that automated methods miss and correct them. Human-in-the-loop is practical for low-volume, high-stakes applications like legal document drafting or medical report generation. For high-volume applications, human review can be applied to a sample for quality control and training data collection.

## Moving Forward

Hallucination detection is a critical component of RAG evaluation. RAG systems reduce but do not eliminate hallucinations. Intrinsic hallucinations contradict the context. Extrinsic hallucinations add unsupported information. Both types degrade trust and can cause harm. Detection methods include context-based checks, knowledge-based verification, uncertainty signals, and consistency checks. Automated scoring enables continuous monitoring, but subtle hallucinations remain challenging to detect.

Hallucination rates vary across domains and applications, with typical rates ranging from 5% to 30%. The business impact depends on the cost of errors and the criticality of trust. Mitigation strategies include improving retrieval, prompt engineering, model selection, output filtering, and human review. No single strategy eliminates hallucinations, but layering multiple strategies reduces rates to acceptable levels.

The next sections continue building the evaluation stack, covering citation accuracy and evaluation protocols. Hallucinations introduce fabricated content, but citation errors introduce false attribution. Together with faithfulness, correctness, and hallucination detection, citation accuracy completes the picture of generation quality and enables you to build RAG systems that users can trust.
