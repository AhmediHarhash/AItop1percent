# 5.8 — Prompt Review Processes: Code Review for Prompts

A fintech startup lost their SOC 2 compliance certification in September 2025 when auditors discovered that junior engineers had been modifying production prompts for their fraud detection system without review. A well-intentioned prompt change to reduce false positives had also reduced true positive detection by 18%, letting $340K in fraudulent transactions through over six weeks. No one had reviewed the change. No one had tested it against historical fraud patterns. No one had validated it met their regulatory requirements for fraud monitoring. The engineer pushed the update to production using the same self-merge privileges they had for frontend code. The company spent four months and $180K on remediation and re-auditing.

Prompts are instructions that control system behavior, make decisions affecting users and revenue, and handle sensitive data. They deserve the same review rigor as application code, not less. **Prompt review processes** ensure changes are technically sound, align with requirements, don't introduce security risks, and meet domain-specific standards before reaching production.

## Why Prompts Need Code Review

Prompts have broad impact with subtle changes. Adding one sentence to a prompt can completely change system behavior. Removing a constraint can open security vulnerabilities. Rewording an instruction can shift output tone from professional to casual. These changes aren't obvious from reading a diff the way code changes often are.

Prompts encode business logic and product requirements that engineers might not fully understand. A prompt for medical summarization embeds clinical knowledge about what information matters. A prompt for financial advice encodes regulatory requirements about disclosures. Engineers optimizing for technical metrics might inadvertently violate domain requirements they're unaware of.

Prompts are harder to test comprehensively than code. Code has clear input-output contracts you can test exhaustively. Prompts have probabilistic outputs and vast input spaces. Test coverage that seems comprehensive might miss critical edge cases. Review by domain experts catches issues that automated tests miss.

Changes to prompts are changes to product behavior. When you modify a prompt, you're changing what your product does for users. This deserves product review, not just technical review. The same governance you apply to feature changes should apply to prompt changes.

## Designing Prompt Review Workflows

Start by requiring review for all prompt changes, no exceptions. Whether you're adding a new prompt, modifying an existing one, or deleting deprecated prompts, someone other than the author must review and approve. Self-merged prompt changes are how disasters happen.

Define review tiers based on prompt risk and scope. Low-risk changes (fixing typos in comments, updating example inputs) might need one technical reviewer. Medium-risk changes (rewording instructions, adjusting parameters) need technical and domain expert review. High-risk changes (prompts handling PII, financial decisions, or safety-critical functions) need technical, domain, security, and potentially legal review.

Use pull request workflows just like code changes. Prompt modifications go in branches, get reviewed in PRs, pass automated tests before merge, and include clear descriptions of what changed and why. The mechanics should be identical to code review because prompts are code.

Require test results as part of the review. Reviewers should see not just the prompt diff but also before-and-after outputs from your test suite. A change that looks innocuous in the prompt text might show clear degradation in test outputs. Making test results visible in the review workflow surfaces issues early.

## Technical Review Checklist

Technical reviewers evaluate whether the prompt change is well-implemented and follows engineering best practices. Check that instructions are clear and unambiguous, examples are relevant and correct, output format specifications are complete, error handling is adequate, and the prompt follows your organization's style guide.

Verify the change solves the stated problem without introducing new issues. If the author says they're fixing hallucinations in medical advice, the reviewer should verify both that test results show fewer hallucinations and that accuracy on other dimensions hasn't degraded. Improvements in one area that break other areas aren't improvements.

Check for prompt antipatterns: overly complex instructions that could be simplified, conflicting constraints that confuse the model, missing edge case handling, prompts that are unnecessarily long, or prompts that rely on implicit assumptions rather than explicit instructions. These issues are easier for a reviewer to spot than the author who's been iterating on the prompt.

Evaluate prompt maintainability. Can another engineer understand this prompt six months from now? Are variable placeholders clearly named? Is the structure logical? Are comments adequate? Prompts become technical debt just like code. Review should prevent accumulating prompt debt.

## Domain Expert Review Requirements

Domain experts verify that prompts correctly encode subject matter requirements. A legal expert reviews prompts that generate contracts or legal advice. A medical professional reviews prompts for clinical documentation. A compliance specialist reviews prompts handling regulated data. Their role is to confirm the prompt produces outputs that meet domain standards.

Domain reviewers shouldn't need to understand prompt engineering. They should review example outputs and evaluate whether they're correct, appropriate, and complete from a domain perspective. The review workflow should present them with representative outputs from the modified prompt, not the prompt text itself.

Domain review catches requirements violations that engineers miss. An engineer might optimize a medical summarization prompt for conciseness without realizing that certain clinical details must always be included even if they seem redundant. A medical reviewer spots the missing required elements immediately.

Establish clear domain review criteria. For prompts handling financial advice, criteria might include: includes required risk disclosures, doesn't guarantee returns, appropriately qualifies statements, uses approved terminology. For customer support prompts: maintains company tone standards, doesn't make promises outside policy, escalates appropriately. Make the review criteria explicit so domain experts know what to look for.

## Security Review for Prompts

Security review identifies prompt injection vulnerabilities, PII handling issues, and other security risks. Security reviewers check whether the prompt adequately separates system instructions from user inputs, whether it can be tricked into ignoring constraints, whether it properly handles sensitive data, and whether outputs could leak information they shouldn't.

Test prompts explicitly for injection attacks as part of security review. Try to make the prompt ignore its instructions, reveal its system prompt, execute unintended actions, or produce outputs it should refuse. If your security reviewer can manipulate the prompt in testing, attackers can do it in production.

Review how prompts handle PII and sensitive data. Do they include unnecessary sensitive information in outputs? Do they properly redact or anonymize when required? Do they log sensitive data that should be excluded? Security review ensures prompts comply with privacy requirements and minimize data exposure.

Check prompt access controls. Who can modify this prompt? Who can read test outputs containing potentially sensitive data? Are prompt versions stored securely? Security review extends beyond the prompt content to the infrastructure around it.

## Approval Workflows and Authority

Define who has authority to approve different types of prompt changes. Technical leads might approve low-risk changes. Product managers might need to approve changes affecting user-facing behavior. Security team approval might be required for prompts handling authentication or sensitive operations. Legal approval might be needed for prompts in regulated domains.

Implement approval automation where possible. If a PR passes all automated tests, gets technical review approval, and affects only a low-risk internal tool, auto-merge it after 24 hours. If it touches customer-facing prompts, requires domain expert approval before merge. Match approval overhead to actual risk.

Track approval latency and bottlenecks. If domain expert reviews consistently take a week, you either need more reviewers or a better process for getting their attention. If legal review takes three weeks, establish SLAs or find ways to parallelize review. Slow reviews that block deployments create pressure to bypass review, which defeats the purpose.

Consider async approval workflows for different review types. Technical review happens first and must pass before requesting domain review. Security review can happen in parallel with domain review. Legal review happens last and only for prompts that need it. Optimize the review sequence to minimize latency while maintaining thoroughness.

## Review for Prompt Composition and Dependencies

When prompts are composed from shared components or depend on other prompts, review must consider the whole system, not just the changed component. If you modify a shared instruction snippet used by ten prompts, review must verify all ten prompts still work correctly with the change.

Require reviewers to test dependent prompts when reviewing shared components. Your CI system should automatically run tests for all prompts that depend on modified components, and reviewers should verify those tests pass and that outputs remain appropriate.

Check for unintended coupling between prompts. If modifying prompt A breaks prompt B that supposedly doesn't depend on A, you have hidden dependencies that need to be documented or eliminated. Review surfaces these coupling issues before they cause production incidents.

Version shared components explicitly and review breaking changes more strictly. If everyone depends on "summarization_core_v2," updating it affects everyone. Breaking changes to widely-used components need cross-team review and coordinated deployment planning.

## Regression Testing Requirements for Review

Prompt changes must include regression test results showing the change doesn't break existing functionality. Reviewers should see test pass rates before and after the change, example outputs from regression test cases, and performance metrics if relevant.

If regression tests show degraded performance, the change doesn't proceed to merge without explanation and mitigation. Maybe the degradation is acceptable given the improvements in other areas, but that's a decision reviewers and stakeholders make explicitly, not something the author decides unilaterally.

Require new test cases for new functionality. If you're adding a capability to a prompt, the review should include test cases exercising that capability. If you're fixing a bug, include a test that would have caught the bug. Prompts and their tests should evolve together.

Check test coverage during review. If the author modified instructions for handling edge cases but didn't add tests for those cases, the review should require them before approval. Tests are how you verify the prompt does what the author claims.

## Documentation Standards for Prompt Changes

Every prompt change needs a clear description of what changed and why. "Improved prompt" isn't adequate. "Reduced hallucinations in medical advice outputs by adding explicit instruction to cite sources and mark uncertain statements, reducing hallucination rate from 8% to 3% in testing" is adequate.

Link prompt changes to issues, tickets, or requirements documents. Reviewers should be able to understand the context: what problem is being solved, what requirements must be met, what success looks like. This context enables better review and creates audit trails.

Document known limitations and trade-offs. If your change improves accuracy but increases latency, document that. If it fixes one class of errors but might slightly increase another, note it. Transparent trade-off documentation helps reviewers evaluate whether the change is net positive.

Update prompt documentation as part of the change. If you modify a prompt's behavior, update its documentation to reflect the new behavior. Out-of-date documentation is worse than no documentation because it misleads users. Review should verify documentation changes match code changes.

## Review Velocity and Developer Experience

Balance thoroughness with speed. If prompt reviews take two weeks, developers will find ways around the process. If reviews are rubber stamps that approve everything instantly, they provide no value. Find the middle ground: meaningful review that usually completes within 24-48 hours.

Provide clear review guidelines to reviewers. They should know what to look for, what common issues to flag, and what's acceptable versus blocking. Vague "review this" requests lead to inconsistent reviews and frustrated developers. Specific review checklists lead to consistent, valuable reviews.

Train reviewers on prompt-specific review considerations. Code reviewers know what to look for in code changes. Prompt reviewers need training on prompt-specific issues: injection vulnerabilities, instruction ambiguity, example quality, output format robustness. Invest in reviewer training.

Give reviewers adequate time and context. Don't expect meaningful review of complex prompts in five minutes. Don't expect reviewers to understand context from minimal PR descriptions. Authors should make review easy by providing thorough descriptions, test results, and example outputs.

## Handling Review Feedback and Iterations

When reviewers request changes, authors should address feedback directly and explain their approach. If you disagree with feedback, discuss why rather than ignoring it. If you can't implement requested changes, explain the constraints. Review is a conversation, not a command.

Track common review feedback themes. If reviewers repeatedly flag the same issues across multiple PRs, those issues indicate gaps in guidelines, training, or tooling. Maybe your style guide needs clarification. Maybe you need linters to catch common mistakes before review. Patterns in review feedback drive process improvements.

Require re-review after significant changes. If an author substantially rewrites a prompt after initial review, the reviewer should see the new version before it merges. Small changes can be verified by the author, but large rewrites need fresh eyes.

Close the feedback loop with reviewers. When a prompt change deploys, share production results with reviewers. Let them see whether their concerns were valid or whether production went smoothly. This trains reviewers to calibrate their feedback and builds trust in the process.

## Special Cases and Exceptions

Define when expedited review is justified. If a critical production bug requires an immediate prompt fix, you might allow merge with async review: deploy first, complete full review within 24 hours, roll back if review identifies issues. Document these exceptions clearly so they're not abused.

Handle emergency changes with extra scrutiny after the fact. If you bypassed normal review due to an incident, conduct a thorough post-merge review and incident retrospective. Understand why the emergency happened, whether the fix was appropriate, and how to prevent similar emergencies.

Establish review requirements for experiments and prototypes. Experimental prompts in sandbox environments might need lighter review than production prompts. But define clear criteria for when experiments graduate to production and require full review. Don't let experimental code become production code without proper review.

Review prompt deprecations and deletions carefully. Removing a prompt might break dependent systems or eliminate capabilities users rely on. Deletion review should verify no active dependencies exist and that migration paths are clear for any affected users.

## Measuring Review Effectiveness

Track metrics that indicate whether prompt review is working. Measure: percentage of prompt changes that get proper review, time from PR creation to approval, defects found in review versus production, and correlation between review depth and production quality.

Monitor review bypass rates. If developers merge prompts without required approvals, your process has problems. Maybe it's too slow, too bureaucratic, or unclear. High bypass rates indicate the process needs fixing, not that developers are irresponsible.

Survey developers about review quality. Do they find reviews helpful or frustrating? Do reviewers catch real issues or just bikeshed minor points? Developer feedback reveals whether reviews add value or just add delay.

Analyze production incidents related to prompt changes. When a prompt change causes problems, was the issue something review should have caught? If yes, why didn't review catch it? Incidents are opportunities to strengthen review effectiveness.

## Building a Prompt Review Culture

Normalize prompt review as standard practice, not bureaucratic overhead. Just as no one questions code review requirements, prompt review should be automatic. Cultural acceptance comes from consistently applying the process and demonstrating its value.

Celebrate catches in review. When a reviewer identifies a subtle bug or domain violation before production, recognize that publicly. This reinforces that review adds value and encourages thorough reviewing.

Share interesting review discussions. When a PR generates good technical or domain debate that leads to better prompts, share the discussion with the broader team. Others learn from these examples and improve their own prompt development.

Make review a learning opportunity for authors and reviewers. Authors learn from feedback about what makes good prompts. Reviewers learn about new techniques and requirements by seeing others' work. Treat review as knowledge sharing, not gatekeeping.

## Integrating Review with Deployment Gates

Connect review approval to deployment permissions. Prompts without required approvals can't deploy to production environments. Enforce this technically through deployment tooling, not just through policy. Technical enforcement is reliable; policy enforcement is not.

Require review sign-off at each promotion stage. Moving from dev to staging might need technical review. Moving from staging to production might need domain and security review. Progressive review as prompts move through environments catches issues before they reach users.

Audit review compliance regularly. Periodically check that production prompts have appropriate review records. If you find prompts that bypassed review, investigate how and fix the gap in your process or tooling.

Include review status in prompt metadata. Track in your prompt registry which reviewers approved each version, when approval occurred, and what review tier was required. This creates audit trails for compliance and enables retrospective analysis.

## Review Process Evolution

Start with basic review requirements and increase rigor as your team grows and learns. Initial review might just be "one other person looks at it." Mature review includes role-specific reviewers, automated checks, formal checklists, and multi-stage approval. Evolve deliberately.

Regularly review your review process. Is it catching the issues you care about? Is it taking too long? Are developers working around it? Gather data and feedback quarterly, then adjust. Process should serve your goals, and your goals evolve as your product and team mature.

Document review process changes and communicate them clearly. If you add new review requirements, explain why and train reviewers on what to look for. If you streamline review for certain cases, clarify the new criteria. Process changes that surprise people get ignored or resisted.

Your prompt review process is a reflection of how seriously you take prompt quality, security, and compliance. Invest in it appropriately for your domain and risk profile. A chatbot for finding restaurants needs different review rigor than a system making medical diagnoses, but both need more than zero review.

## The Compound Effect of Rigorous Review

Consistent prompt review has compound benefits. Each reviewed prompt is higher quality. Each review catches issues and teaches the author. Over time, authors internalize review standards and write better prompts initially. Review catches fewer issues because prompts are better, not because review is ineffective.

Review creates institutional knowledge about what good prompts look like in your domain. New team members learn by seeing what passes review and what gets flagged. Your organization's prompt quality standards become embedded in the review process and propagate through the team.

The discipline of review forces clarity. Authors who know their prompts will be reviewed write clearer prompts with better documentation. The awareness that someone will evaluate your work improves the quality of the work.

Prompt review isn't bureaucracy. It's quality assurance for the instructions that control your AI systems. Treat it seriously, invest in making it effective, and you'll prevent production disasters while building organizational capability to create excellent prompts reliably. But even excellent reviewed prompts eventually become outdated. Understanding when and how to retire them safely requires careful deprecation and sunset policies.
