# Chapter 2 — Prompt Engineering Patterns and Techniques

Every production system converges on a set of reusable patterns: chain-of-thought for reasoning, role prompts for tone control, format enforcement for structured outputs. This chapter catalogs the patterns that work, the anti-patterns that break silently, and the techniques that separate fragile prompts from robust ones.
