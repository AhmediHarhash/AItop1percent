# Chapter 6 — Memory Evaluation and Observability

You cannot trust memory you cannot measure. Memory systems fail silently — retrieving stale information, hallucinating recall, leaking private data, and inflating costs without anyone noticing. This chapter covers the evaluation and observability infrastructure that keeps memory honest.

*We begin with the most fundamental question: is the memory your system retrieves actually relevant and accurate?*
