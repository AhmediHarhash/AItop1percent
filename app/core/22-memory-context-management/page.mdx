# Memory & Context Management

Every AI system that persists beyond a single request must answer a deceptively simple question: what does the model know right now, and how did it get that knowledge? Memory is the difference between an AI assistant that feels intelligent and one that feels broken. Without disciplined memory architecture, models contradict themselves across turns, agents forget their own plans mid-execution, personalization becomes creepy surveillance, costs spiral as context windows fill with irrelevant history, and compliance violations accumulate silently in logs nobody reads.

This section covers the full stack of memory engineering for production AI systems in 2026: from the fundamental distinction between context and memory, through context window budgeting and agent state management, to privacy governance, attack resistance, and the evaluation infrastructure that keeps memory systems honest. You will learn how to build memory that makes your system smarter without making it dangerous, expensive, or untrustworthy.
