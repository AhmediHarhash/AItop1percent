# Chapter 8 — Memory Attack Resistance and Integrity

Memory is an attack surface. Adversaries can poison what your system remembers, inject instructions through stored content, exfiltrate data through memory leakage, and manipulate behavior by corrupting stored preferences. Memory security is not a subset of general AI security — it requires its own architecture, defenses, and testing.
