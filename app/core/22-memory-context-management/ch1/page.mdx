# Section 22 — Memory & Context Management

## Chapter 1

### Plain English

Memory & Context Management answers one question:

**"What does the AI know right now, why does it know it, and how do we control that knowledge over time?"**

Without disciplined memory:
- models contradict themselves
- conversations drift
- agents hallucinate intent
- privacy breaks
- costs explode

Memory is not "more tokens."
Memory is **curated knowledge with rules**.

---

### Why Memory Becomes Critical in 2026

As systems evolve from:
- single prompts → conversations
- chat → agents
- tools → workflows
- users → organizations

They must remember:
- goals
- constraints
- preferences
- decisions
- past actions

But uncontrolled memory is **a liability**, not a feature.

---

### Core Principle (2026)

**Memory must be intentional, bounded, auditable, and revocable.**

If you can't explain:
- what is remembered
- where it lives
- who can access it
- when it expires

Then you don't have memory — you have risk.

---

### Memory vs Context (Important Distinction)

#### Context
- short-lived
- per-request or per-turn
- fed directly into the model
- discarded after use

#### Memory
- persistent
- cross-request
- stored externally
- selectively injected

Confusing these two causes most failures.

### The Four Memory Horizons

In 2026, mature systems use **four horizons**:

1. Instant context
2. Session memory
3. Long-term memory
4. Organizational memory

Each horizon has different rules.

---

#### 1) Instant Context

Includes:
- current user input
- retrieved documents
- immediate tool outputs

Rules:
- strictly bounded
- relevance-filtered
- expires immediately

Goal: enable correct reasoning now.

---

#### 2) Session Memory

Includes:
- conversation state
- recent decisions
- short-term preferences

Rules:
- scoped to a session
- resettable
- summarized over time

Goal: consistency during interaction.

---

#### 3) Long-Term Memory

Includes:
- user preferences
- historical actions
- learned patterns

Rules:
- explicit consent
- clear schema
- expiration policies
- editable by users

Goal: personalization without creepiness.

---

#### 4) Organizational Memory

Includes:
- policies
- procedures
- institutional knowledge
- shared decisions

Rules:
- governed
- versioned
- auditable
- role-based access

Goal: institutional continuity.

---

### Memory Storage Architecture

Memory should NOT live:
- only in prompts
- only in embeddings
- only in logs

Memory lives in **systems**, not text blobs.

Common components:
- structured databases
- vector stores (for semantic recall)
- summaries
- metadata stores

---

### Memory Schemas (2026 Standard)

Every memory item should include:
- type
- source
- owner
- confidence
- timestamp
- expiry
- access rules

Unstructured memory becomes unusable.

---

### Memory Injection Strategy

Memory is not dumped blindly into context.

Injection rules:
- relevance-based
- priority-based
- budget-aware
- task-specific

The system decides what to recall.
The model does not.

---

### Summarization & Compression

As memory grows:
- raw history becomes expensive
- signal gets diluted

Solutions:
- rolling summaries
- hierarchical summaries
- importance scoring

Summarization must be:
- deterministic
- auditable
- evaluable

---

### Memory for RAG Systems

RAG memory must distinguish:
- source truth
- inferred knowledge
- outdated information

RAG memory failures lead to:
- stale answers
- false authority
- trust erosion

Freshness is a memory property.

---

### Memory for Agent Systems

Agents require memory for:
- plans
- partial progress
- tool outcomes
- failures

Agent memory must support:
- recovery
- retries
- checkpoints
- rollback

Stateless agents are unreliable agents.

---

### Memory for Voice Systems

Voice memory constraints:
- low latency
- short turns
- high emotional sensitivity

Voice systems typically use:
- minimal session memory
- aggressive summarization
- strict expiration

Over-remembering in voice feels invasive.

---

### Privacy & Compliance (Critical)

Memory must respect:
- user consent
- data minimization
- right to delete
- data residency

2026 expectation:
- memory deletion is immediate and verifiable
- memory access is logged

Privacy violations often originate in memory systems.

---

### Memory Expiration & Decay

Nothing should live forever.

Memory decay strategies:
- time-based expiry
- usage-based decay
- confidence decay

Forgetting is a feature.

---

### Memory Editing & Correction

Users and operators must be able to:
- inspect memory
- correct errors
- delete entries

Uneditable memory breaks trust.

---

### Memory & Evaluation

Memory systems must be evaluated for:
- relevance accuracy
- hallucinated recall
- privacy leakage
- staleness

Memory errors are quality errors.

---

### Observability for Memory

You must log:
- what was recalled
- why it was recalled
- what was injected
- what was skipped

If memory behavior is invisible, it cannot be trusted.

---

### Governance & Memory

Enterprises require:
- memory policies
- access controls
- audit trails
- compliance reporting

Memory governance is non-negotiable.

---

### Founder Perspective

For founders:
- memory enables differentiation
- supports personalization
- improves agent reliability
- unlocks enterprise use cases

But unmanaged memory kills trust fast.
