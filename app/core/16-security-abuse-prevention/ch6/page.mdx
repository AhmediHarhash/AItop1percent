# Chapter 6 — Model Theft and Extraction

Your model is not just a service — it is an asset. It encodes your domain expertise, your training data decisions, your policy tuning, your competitive edge. An attacker who wants to replicate your system does not need your weights or your infrastructure. They just need your API. Query the model enough times with the right inputs, collect the outputs, train a distilled version. Extract the system prompt, reverse-engineer the guardrails, infer the training distribution. Your model becomes their model, at a fraction of the cost you spent building it.

Model theft is invisible until it is done. There is no intrusion, no breach, no alarm. Just thousands of API calls that look like normal usage until you realize a competitor launched a suspiciously similar product. Or your unique responses start appearing in someone else's system. Or your carefully tuned behavior shows up in a pirated model sold on underground forums. The attacker does not need to hack you — they just need to talk to your model long enough to learn how it thinks. Your defenses are not just about protecting data. They are about protecting the intelligence you built.

*Every query teaches the attacker something — the question is whether you are watching.*
