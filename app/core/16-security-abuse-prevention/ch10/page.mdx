# Chapter 10 — Denial of Service and Economic Attacks

Not every attack tries to steal data or compromise integrity. Some attackers aim for availability. Some aim for your budget. A denial of service attack against an AI system does not crash the server — it makes every request so expensive, so slow, or so frequent that your system becomes unusable or financially unsustainable. These are economic warfare attacks. The goal is not to break in. The goal is to drain resources until you cannot afford to stay online.

Traditional DDoS defenses assume cheap requests and network-layer floods. AI systems face a different threat model. A single prompt can cost dollars. A carefully crafted input can trigger minutes of compute. An attacker does not need volume. They need precision. One malicious user with knowledge of your system's cost structure can do more damage than a botnet. And when the bill arrives, the attacker is long gone.

*The attacker who destroys availability does not need to breach your perimeter — they just need to know how to make your system spend money faster than you can approve purchase orders.*
