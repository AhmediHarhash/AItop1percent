# Chapter 12 — Detection, Monitoring, and Incident Response

Security is not a state you reach. It is a process you maintain. The attacker is already inside your system, testing defenses you have not thought to build yet. Detection is what separates a contained incident from a catastrophic breach. Monitoring is what tells you when normal becomes abnormal. Incident response is what happens when detection succeeds and you have minutes, not hours, to decide what to do.

Most AI security failures are not discovered through alerts. They are discovered weeks later in customer complaints, audit logs, or regulatory inquiries. By then, the damage is done. The goal of this chapter is to compress that timeline. Find the attack while it is happening. Understand what the attacker is trying to do. Stop it before it escalates. Learn from it before the next one starts. Security monitoring for AI systems is not about collecting logs. It is about building the nervous system that tells you when something is wrong before users do.

*The difference between a close call and a disaster is how quickly you know something is wrong and how decisively you act when you find out.*
