# Chapter 7 — Identity, Access, and Entitlements

Who is talking to your model? Are they who they claim to be? What are they allowed to do? These are not new questions — every production system answers them — but AI makes the stakes different. A stolen session token does not just access data, it accesses reasoning. A spoofed identity does not just bypass a paywall, it gains access to capabilities that should be gated. An entitlement abuse does not just steal compute, it extracts intelligence your business depends on. The model does not check credentials. It assumes the request is authorized. That assumption is the vulnerability.

Authentication and authorization in AI systems are not just about securing endpoints. They are about securing context, memory, and capability. A user who should only access public features should not be able to manipulate the model into using private tools. A trial account should not be able to harvest premium outputs. A session that expires should not leave residual access in the model's memory. Every identity boundary is also an AI boundary, and every access control failure becomes an AI security failure. You cannot secure what you cannot identify, and you cannot enforce what you do not log.

*The model trusts the identity you give it — make sure that identity is real.*
