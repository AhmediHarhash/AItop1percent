# Chapter 12 — Governance, Compliance, and Human Oversight

Human review infrastructure is not just an operational necessity—it is a compliance requirement. When regulators ask how your AI system makes decisions, when auditors want evidence that humans were involved, when users exercise their right to contest automated outcomes, your review infrastructure must provide answers. The EU AI Act's meaningful human oversight requirements, GDPR's right to explanation, HIPAA's audit mandates, and SOX's control evidence demands all converge on the same question: can you prove that qualified humans reviewed what mattered, when it mattered, with the authority to intervene? This chapter covers the governance, compliance, and human oversight requirements that transform your review infrastructure from an internal tool into a regulatory asset.

*The auditor does not care how good your AI is. The auditor cares whether you can prove a human was in control.*
