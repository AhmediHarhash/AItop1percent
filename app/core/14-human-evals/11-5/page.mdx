# 11.5 — Tenant Isolation: Reviewers See Only What They Should

In early 2025, a legal tech company discovered that twelve contract reviewers working on a pharmaceutical client's confidential agreements had been seeing prompts and outputs from a competing pharmaceutical company's contracts for three weeks. The root cause was a missing tenant filter in the task assignment query. The review platform assigned tasks based on reviewer availability and skill level but did not enforce client-level isolation. The company had to notify both clients of the cross-contamination, invalidate three weeks of review data, and terminate the vendor relationship. The breach cost $280,000 in rework, legal fees, and lost client trust. The fix took one engineer four hours to implement — a client ID filter on the task queue.

Tenant isolation is the principle that reviewers working for different customers, different projects, or different data classifications must never see each other's data, even when they use the same review platform and even when they log in during the same hour. Multi-tenant review infrastructure is efficient. You run one system. You onboard one vendor pool. You amortize infrastructure costs across dozens of clients. But efficiency creates risk. If the system does not enforce strict boundaries between tenants, a configuration error, a SQL injection, or a role-based access control mistake can expose the wrong data to the wrong reviewer.

## What Tenant Isolation Protects

Tenant isolation protects three things. First, it protects confidentiality. Customer A's data must not be visible to reviewers assigned to Customer B. If you operate a review platform for enterprise SaaS customers, each customer's prompts, outputs, and user conversations are proprietary. A reviewer working on Company X's support chat transcripts should never see Company Y's support chat transcripts. The companies may be competitors. The data may contain trade secrets. Cross-contamination is a contract breach and a potential legal liability.

Second, it protects compliance. If you review healthcare data for one client and financial data for another, the two data sets have different regulatory requirements. Healthcare reviewers must be HIPAA-trained. Financial reviewers must pass background checks under SOX or PCI-DSS. If a healthcare reviewer accidentally sees financial data, you have exposed regulated data to someone who was not vetted for that access. If a financial reviewer sees healthcare data, you have violated HIPAA's minimum necessary access rule. Tenant isolation is not just a feature. It is a compliance control.

Third, it protects quality. If reviewers see data from multiple clients in random order, they lose context. A reviewer who spent an hour evaluating customer service tone for a retail client and then suddenly sees legal contract summaries for a law firm will apply the wrong mental model. Quality degrades when reviewers context-switch across different task types, different quality standards, and different client expectations. Tenant isolation ensures that a reviewer's session is scoped to one project, one client, one quality rubric at a time.

## The Tenant ID as the Security Boundary

The simplest and most reliable way to enforce tenant isolation is to attach a tenant identifier to every piece of data in the review system and to filter every query by that identifier. When a reviewer logs in, the system assigns them a session scope tied to one or more tenant IDs. Every task they request, every prompt they view, every output they rate is pre-filtered by their session scope. The system does not trust the reviewer's session to request only the correct data. The system enforces the boundary at the database and API layer.

When a reviewer requests the next task in their queue, the query looks like this in concept: retrieve the next unreviewed task where the tenant ID matches the reviewer's assigned scope and where the task status is open and where the reviewer has the required skill tag. The tenant ID filter comes first. It is not optional. It is not configurable. It is baked into every query that touches review data.

This architecture prevents two failure modes. First, it prevents accidental cross-tenant exposure from application bugs. If a developer writes a new query and forgets to include the tenant filter, the query fails at the database level because the database enforces row-level security policies that require a tenant context. The bug surfaces during testing, not in production. Second, it prevents privilege escalation attacks. If an attacker compromises a reviewer account and tries to modify API requests to access a different tenant's data, the database rejects the query because the session token does not grant access to that tenant ID.

## Role-Based Access and Tenant Assignment

Reviewers do not choose which tenant they work for. The system assigns them. When you onboard a new reviewer, you assign them to one or more tenant scopes based on the contracts and clearances they hold. A reviewer who is cleared to work on Customer A's data and Customer B's data receives a session that can access both tenant IDs. A reviewer who is cleared only for Customer A receives a session that can access only Customer A's tenant ID. The assignment happens in the identity and access management layer, not in the review application.

When the reviewer authenticates, the IAM system issues a token that includes the tenant scopes as claims. The token is cryptographically signed. The review application validates the token, extracts the tenant scopes, and uses them to filter all data access. The reviewer cannot modify the token. The token expires after a set period. If the reviewer's tenant assignment changes — because a contract ends, because a clearance is revoked, because they are reassigned to a different project — the next time they authenticate, they receive a new token with updated scopes.

You audit tenant assignments monthly. You generate a report showing which reviewers have access to which tenant IDs, which contracts authorize that access, and which clearances or training certifications are required. You cross-check the report against active vendor agreements and data processing addendums. If you find a reviewer with tenant access that no longer matches an active contract, you revoke the access immediately.

## Preventing Cross-Tenant Leakage Through Shared Metadata

Tenant isolation is not just about review data. It extends to metadata, logs, task queues, and analytics dashboards. If two tenants share the same review platform, they should not see each other's presence in the system. Customer A should not know that Customer B exists. A reviewer assigned to Customer A should not see task counts, completion rates, or quality scores for Customer B.

This requires scoping every view, every report, and every dashboard by tenant ID. When a project manager logs in to check review progress, they see only the projects they manage. They do not see a global task queue. They do not see aggregated metrics across all tenants. The system presents tenant-scoped data as if no other tenants exist.

Shared metadata is an easy place for leakage to occur. If task IDs are sequential integers and a reviewer working on Tenant A sees task 5001, then later sees task 5120, they can infer that 119 tasks were created in between — possibly for other tenants. If session logs record IP addresses and timestamps for all reviewers, and those logs are accessible to a tenant administrator, that administrator can see when reviewers who also work for other tenants are active. This reveals information about other tenants' review volumes and timelines.

The solution is to partition metadata by tenant. Task IDs include a tenant prefix or are UUIDs with no sequential information. Logs are filtered by tenant scope before display. Dashboards query only tenant-scoped data. If you need cross-tenant analytics for internal capacity planning, you build a separate admin-only view that is not accessible to tenant users or reviewers.

## Testing Tenant Isolation During Onboarding

Before you grant a new reviewer access to production data, you test their tenant isolation. You create a test account with access to Tenant A. You create a second test account with access to Tenant B. You log in as the Tenant A reviewer and verify that you see only Tenant A tasks. You attempt to manually modify API requests to request Tenant B tasks. The system should reject those requests with an authorization error.

You log in as the Tenant B reviewer and repeat the test. You verify that the two reviewers, even if they connect from the same IP address, see completely non-overlapping data. You test edge cases. What happens if a reviewer's session token includes both Tenant A and Tenant B? Do they see tasks from both tenants in random order, or does the system require them to select a tenant context before showing tasks? The answer depends on your policy, but the system must enforce it consistently.

You document the test results. You log the API requests and responses. You keep the test data for compliance audits. When a regulator or a customer asks how you enforce tenant isolation, you show them the test logs that prove cross-tenant access is blocked at the API and database layers.

## Handling Reviewers Who Work for Multiple Tenants

Some reviewers are cleared to work on multiple clients. A senior contract reviewer might work on Client A in the morning and Client B in the afternoon. This is operationally efficient, but it creates a risk of accidental context bleed. If the reviewer finishes a Client A task at 11:58 and starts a Client B task at 12:01, they might still be thinking in the Client A mindset when they rate the Client B output.

You mitigate this by requiring explicit tenant context switching. When the reviewer logs in, the system asks which client they want to work on today. The reviewer selects Client A. The session is scoped to Client A for the duration of the shift. If they want to switch to Client B, they log out and log back in, selecting Client B at the context prompt. This creates a deliberate break. The reviewer has to think about which client they are working for. The system does not silently switch contexts mid-session.

Some platforms enforce single-tenant sessions. A reviewer can only work for one tenant per day. If they are assigned to multiple tenants, they choose which one to work on each morning. This reduces flexibility but increases safety. The reviewer never has to mentally switch between client contexts, client rubrics, or client data classification policies during a single shift.

## Vendor-Specific Tenant Segmentation

If you use multiple annotation vendors, you might assign different vendors to different tenants. Vendor X handles Tenant A. Vendor Y handles Tenant B. This creates a natural isolation boundary. Vendor X's reviewers have no credentials to access Tenant B data. Vendor Y's reviewers have no credentials to access Tenant A data. Even if both vendors use the same review platform, the platform enforces vendor-level isolation through separate authentication realms.

This approach simplifies compliance. Each vendor signs a data processing agreement that covers only the tenants they support. If Tenant A requires HIPAA compliance, you choose a vendor that is HIPAA-certified. If Tenant B does not require HIPAA, you choose a lower-cost vendor. The vendor's access is scoped to the tenants they are contracted for. You do not have to worry about a non-HIPAA vendor accidentally seeing HIPAA data because the system never grants them access.

The downside is reduced flexibility. If Vendor X has excess capacity and Vendor Y is backlogged, you cannot easily shift tasks from Tenant B to Vendor X without renegotiating contracts, updating access controls, and re-vetting reviewers. The isolation that protects you also constrains your operational agility.

## Monitoring for Cross-Tenant Access Attempts

Even with strong technical controls, you monitor for access attempts that cross tenant boundaries. You set up alerts for any API request that includes a tenant ID mismatch. If a reviewer's session token says Tenant A, but the API request asks for data from Tenant B, the request is blocked and logged. One such attempt could be a developer testing a new feature. Two such attempts in a week from the same reviewer is suspicious. Five such attempts is grounds for investigation.

You review access logs weekly. You look for patterns where reviewers are requesting tasks from tenants they should not see. You look for configuration errors where tenant ID filters were omitted from queries. You look for cases where a tenant administrator ran a report that included cross-tenant data. Each anomaly gets a root cause analysis. If the cause is a bug, you fix the bug and regression-test. If the cause is a policy violation, you escalate to vendor management.

Tenant isolation is not a one-time configuration. It is an ongoing discipline. Every new feature, every new query, every new report must include tenant scoping as a first-order requirement. You test it during code review. You test it during QA. You monitor it in production. When isolation fails, data leaks — and in a multi-tenant review system, a leak does not just harm one client. It harms every client whose data was commingled. The next subchapter covers tamper-evident logging — the technical and procedural controls that ensure every action a reviewer takes is recorded, immutable, and available for audit, even years after the review session ends.
