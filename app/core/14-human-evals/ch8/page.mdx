# Chapter 8 — Disagreement Resolution and Decision Defensibility

Disagreement between reviewers is not failure—it is information. When two qualified reviewers look at the same item and reach different conclusions, the disagreement reveals something about the task, the guidelines, or the edge case that neither reviewer alone could surface. The question is not how to eliminate disagreement but how to resolve it in ways that improve your guidelines, train your reviewers, and produce decisions that can withstand scrutiny. This chapter covers disagreement as signal, resolution mechanisms, adjudication workflows, rationale documentation, evidence rules, legal holds, and appeals processes.

*Every resolved disagreement is a lesson. Every unresolved disagreement is a liability. Build systems that transform the former into institutional knowledge and prevent the latter from accumulating.*
