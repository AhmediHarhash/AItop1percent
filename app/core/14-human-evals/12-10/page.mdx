# 12.10 — Human Override Authority and Response Time SLAs

In June 2025, a healthcare technology company operating an AI-powered patient triage system faced an incident that exposed a critical gap in their governance design. At 11:47 PM on a Saturday, a senior reviewer flagged a high-severity model output that recommended deferring emergency care for a patient presenting chest pain symptoms. The reviewer attempted to override the decision and escalate to the on-call medical director. The override request sat in a queue for nine minutes because no one had defined who held override authority after business hours, what the response time requirement was, or whether the system should halt further processing while awaiting override approval. By the time the medical director manually intervened, the patient had already been routed to a lower-priority care pathway. The incident triggered a formal investigation, revealed ambiguous override policies to regulators, and cost the company $280,000 in remediation, legal review, and system redesign. The root cause was not technical failure. It was the absence of clearly defined override authority and enforceable response time commitments.

Human override authority is not optional. It is a regulatory requirement in high-stakes domains and a practical necessity in every AI system that makes decisions affecting real people. But override authority without response time SLAs is theater. If a reviewer can override a decision but no one is required to respond within a defined window, the override mechanism provides no protection. If multiple stakeholders can override but no hierarchy exists to resolve conflicts, override authority creates chaos instead of control. If override requests are logged but not tracked against SLA compliance, the system cannot prove that human oversight is meaningful. Your override governance must answer three questions with absolute clarity: who holds override authority, how fast they must respond, and how the system enforces both.

## Defining Override Authority by Decision Type and Severity

Not every decision requires the same override authority. A content moderation decision flagged as potential hate speech requires different oversight than a loan approval decision or a medical diagnosis recommendation. Your override governance must map authority to decision type, severity, and regulatory domain. This is not a single policy. It is a matrix that defines which roles hold override authority for which decisions under which conditions.

For **Tier 1 decisions** — life-safety, medical, financial harm, legal liability — override authority typically rests with domain experts who hold professional credentials or regulatory accountability. A medical decision override requires a licensed physician. A financial decision override in a SOX-controlled environment requires a compliance officer or authorized financial controller. These are not permissions you delegate to junior reviewers or generalist operators. The person overriding the decision must have the legal and professional standing to accept responsibility for that override. Your system enforces this by restricting override access to credentialed roles and logging the identity, timestamp, and justification of every override action.

For **Tier 2 decisions** — content policy, brand risk, moderate financial exposure — override authority may rest with senior reviewers, subject matter experts, or escalation managers. These roles do not require professional licenses, but they require domain expertise and organizational accountability. A content moderation override for borderline hate speech might require two senior reviewers to agree. A pricing override that affects contract terms might require approval from both product and legal. Your override policy defines the approval chain, the conditions under which single-reviewer overrides are permitted, and the conditions that require multi-stakeholder consensus.

For **Tier 3 decisions** — low-risk content classification, informational responses, routine workflow automation — override authority may rest with any trained reviewer. The stakes are low enough that rapid correction matters more than credential verification. A reviewer who sees a misclassified support ticket can override the model's routing decision without escalation. But even here, you log the override, track the frequency, and review patterns to identify model drift or reviewer confusion.

The distinction matters because override authority is a governance artifact. When an auditor asks "who can override the AI," your answer must be precise, role-based, and mapped to risk. A system where every reviewer can override every decision is not evidence of strong oversight. It is evidence of weak controls.

## Defining Response Time SLAs by Impact and Regulatory Domain

Override authority without response time SLAs is not meaningful oversight. If a reviewer flags a decision and the override request sits in a queue for hours, days, or indefinitely, the human oversight claim is false. Your governance must define maximum response times for override requests, enforce those SLAs technically, and report compliance in audit logs.

For **immediate-harm decisions** — medical emergencies, content that incites imminent violence, financial transactions with fraud indicators — the response time SLA is measured in minutes. A medical override request flagged as urgent requires response within five minutes, maximum. If no authorized responder is available within that window, the system escalates to the next level of authority, pages the on-call lead, or halts the decision entirely until human review is complete. This is not aspirational. It is a hard requirement enforced by automated escalation.

For **high-risk decisions** — loan denials, insurance claim rejections, content moderation actions that affect account status — the response time SLA is measured in hours. A flagged loan decision might require override review within two hours during business hours, four hours outside business hours. The system tracks elapsed time from flag to response, alerts the escalation chain if the SLA is at risk, and blocks the decision from being executed until override review is complete.

For **moderate-risk decisions** — content classification disputes, workflow routing corrections, low-dollar pricing adjustments — the response time SLA is measured in business days. A flagged routing decision might require review within one business day. These SLAs are less urgent, but they are still enforced. A backlog of unreviewed override requests is a governance failure, not a minor operational issue.

Your SLA structure must account for time zones, after-hours coverage, and weekend operations. A global system that operates 24/7 cannot have SLAs that assume business hours in a single geography. You define different SLA tiers for in-hours and out-of-hours requests, staff on-call coverage for high-severity domains, and automate escalation when coverage gaps appear. The system does not wait for someone to notice that an override request is aging. It enforces the SLA and escalates when the clock runs out.

## Escalation Chains and Conflict Resolution

Override authority becomes complex when multiple stakeholders have legitimate but conflicting views on whether a decision should be overridden. A content moderation reviewer flags a post as violating hate speech policy. A legal reviewer argues it is protected speech. A trust and safety lead believes it creates imminent harm risk. All three hold override authority in their domains. Your governance must define how conflicts are resolved, who holds final authority, and how fast resolution must occur.

The most effective conflict resolution model is **hierarchical escalation with defined tie-breakers**. If two reviewers with equivalent authority disagree, the decision escalates to the next level of authority within a defined time window. If a content reviewer and a legal reviewer disagree on a borderline hate speech case, the decision escalates to the trust and safety director within 30 minutes. The director reviews the evidence, consults both stakeholders, and makes a binding decision. That decision is logged, justified in writing, and becomes precedent for similar cases.

In **regulatory-controlled domains**, the tie-breaker is not discretionary. It is defined by regulation. If a HIPAA-covered decision involves patient safety, the licensed medical professional holds final override authority. If a SOX-controlled decision involves financial reporting, the compliance officer holds final authority. Your system enforces these rules technically by restricting final-approval permissions to the roles that carry regulatory accountability.

For **cross-functional decisions** where no single stakeholder holds clear authority, you define a **decision review board** model. The board consists of representatives from each stakeholder group — product, legal, trust and safety, engineering, domain experts. The board reviews flagged decisions, deliberates on precedent, and issues binding rulings. These rulings are documented, stored in a decision registry, and referenced in future cases. The board does not review every override request. It reviews only the cases that escalate due to stakeholder conflict or novel scenarios not covered by existing policy.

Escalation chains must have **maximum resolution times**. A conflict that escalates to a director must be resolved within two hours. A conflict that escalates to a decision review board must be resolved within 24 hours. If resolution does not occur within the defined window, the system applies a default action — typically the most conservative option that minimizes harm. A disputed content moderation decision defaults to removal. A disputed medical recommendation defaults to human escalation for manual review. The default is not random. It is the risk-minimizing choice defined in your governance policy.

## Technical Enforcement of Override Authority

Override authority is not enforced by policy documents. It is enforced by identity, access control, and system-level permissions. If your override governance says only licensed physicians can override medical decisions, your system must technically prevent anyone without that credential from executing the override. This requires integration with identity management, role-based access control, and real-time credential verification.

Your **identity management system** maintains a credential registry for every role that holds override authority. A physician's license number, expiration date, and issuing state are stored and verified. A compliance officer's employment status and SOX authorization are checked. Before a user is granted override permissions, the system verifies their credentials in real time. If a physician's license expires, their override permissions are automatically revoked within 24 hours. If a compliance officer leaves the company, their access is terminated immediately.

Your **role-based access control** maps override permissions to roles, not individuals. You do not grant override authority to a specific person. You grant it to the role "Licensed Physician, Emergency Medicine" and assign individuals to that role based on verified credentials. This separation allows you to change personnel without changing governance. When a new physician is hired, they are assigned to the role and inherit the permissions. When a physician leaves, they are removed from the role and lose access.

Your **override execution flow** enforces multi-step approval for high-risk decisions. A reviewer flags a decision for override. The system checks the reviewer's role, verifies their credentials, and routes the request to the authorized approver. The approver receives a notification, reviews the evidence, and either approves or denies the override. The system logs every step — who flagged, who approved, when, and why. If the approver does not respond within the SLA window, the system escalates to the next level of authority or applies the default action.

The enforcement is not advisory. It is blocking. A user without override authority cannot execute an override, even if they attempt to bypass the UI and interact with the API directly. The permissions are enforced at the API layer, the database layer, and the audit log layer. A failed override attempt is logged as a security event and reviewed by compliance.

## SLA Monitoring, Alerting, and Compliance Reporting

Override response time SLAs are only meaningful if you measure compliance, alert on violations, and report performance to governance stakeholders. Your system tracks every override request from creation to resolution, calculates elapsed time against the SLA, and flags violations in real time.

Your **SLA dashboard** shows current and historical performance. It reports the number of override requests per decision type, the median and 95th percentile response times, the number of SLA violations, and the escalation rate. It breaks down performance by time of day, day of week, and reviewer role. If response times spike on weekends, you identify a coverage gap. If certain decision types consistently violate SLAs, you identify a policy mismatch or understaffing issue.

Your **alerting system** notifies escalation stakeholders when SLAs are at risk. If an override request has been pending for 80% of its SLA window, the system sends an alert to the next level of authority. If a high-severity medical override has been pending for three minutes with no response, the system pages the on-call medical director. The alerts are not passive notifications. They trigger escalation workflows that ensure response even when coverage is thin.

Your **compliance reporting** provides evidence of SLA adherence for auditors. You generate monthly reports showing the total number of override requests, the percentage resolved within SLA, the number of escalations, and the breakdown by decision type and severity. You include anonymized examples of override justifications, conflict resolutions, and default actions. This report is not created on demand when an auditor asks. It is generated automatically, reviewed by governance, and stored in your audit archive.

When an auditor asks "how fast do humans respond to override requests," your answer is not "we respond quickly." It is "98.7% of high-severity overrides are resolved within five minutes, 99.3% of moderate-severity overrides are resolved within two hours, and here is the monthly compliance report showing SLA performance over the past twelve months." That specificity is the difference between passing an audit and triggering a deeper investigation.

Override authority and response time SLAs are the technical foundation of meaningful human oversight. Without them, your human review infrastructure is a compliance checkbox, not a governance system. The next subchapter covers how to assemble that governance into audit-ready proof of meaningful human oversight.
