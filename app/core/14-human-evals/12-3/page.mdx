# 12.3 — Reviewer Identity and Access Control

Reviewer identity management is not a login system. It is a control framework that determines who can make decisions, what data they can see, and how their access is governed, monitored, and revoked. Every human review decision is a processing event under GDPR, an access event under HIPAA, and a control activity under SOX. The identity system is how you prove that only authorized individuals performed those events, that they had the training and clearance required, and that their access was appropriate for the sensitivity of the data. If your identity system cannot answer those questions with precision, your review infrastructure is non-compliant before the first case is opened.

The stakes are different than a typical application login. A reviewer who accesses a case inappropriately is not just a security incident. They are a data breach. A reviewer who makes decisions without current training is not just a quality problem. They are a compliance violation. A contractor whose access is not revoked when their contract ends is not just an operational oversight. They are unauthorized processing under GDPR. The identity system is not supporting the review workflow. It is enforcing legal boundaries.

## Role-Based Access Control as a Legal Requirement

Role-based access control is not an engineering best practice. It is a regulatory requirement. GDPR Article 32 requires appropriate access controls for personal data. HIPAA requires minimum necessary access. SOX requires segregation of duties. The EU AI Act requires that reviewers be competent and trained. All of these requirements are implemented through RBAC.

Your review system must define roles with clear boundaries. A Tier 1 Reviewer can review standard cases up to a certain risk level but cannot approve high-sensitivity cases. A Tier 2 Reviewer can handle escalated cases and override model decisions but cannot change policy or access training data. A Quality Analyst can view review decisions and flag errors but cannot make production decisions. A Compliance Auditor can read all logs but cannot modify any case data. Each role is mapped to specific permissions, specific case types, and specific data sensitivity levels.

The mapping must be documented, versioned, and enforced at the infrastructure level. It is not sufficient to tell a Tier 1 Reviewer that they should not access high-sensitivity cases. The system must prevent it. The access control check must happen before the case data is loaded, not after. If the check happens in the UI but the API allows direct access, the control is illusory. A regulator testing your system will try to bypass the UI. If the API allows it, the control fails.

Role definitions must be stable over time. If a reviewer's role changes, the change must be logged and the previous role's permissions must be revoked immediately. A promotion from Tier 1 to Tier 2 is not just a workflow state change. It is an access escalation event that must be logged with justification, approved by a manager, and synchronized across all systems. If the reviewer retains Tier 1 access after the role change, that is a least-privilege violation.

## Attribute-Based Access Control for Case Sensitivity

Role-based control is not sufficient for all scenarios. Some cases require attribute-based decisions. A reviewer may have the right role to view medical data but not the right jurisdiction to view data from a specific region. A reviewer may have the right clearance to review financial cases but not the right language fluency to review cases in Spanish. RBAC says what you can do. ABAC says when you can do it.

Attributes are properties of the reviewer, the case, or the context. Reviewer attributes include job role, training certifications, language skills, geographic assignment, and security clearance. Case attributes include data sensitivity, user jurisdiction, language, case type, and risk tier. Context attributes include time of day, access location, and whether the access is during a declared incident.

Access is granted only when all attributes align. A Tier 2 Reviewer with EU jurisdiction, English and Spanish fluency, and current GDPR training can access a Restricted-tier Spanish-language case from an EU data subject during normal business hours. The same reviewer cannot access a case from a US data subject in California unless they also have US jurisdiction and CCPA training. The system evaluates all attributes on every access attempt.

This is not theoretical. Under GDPR's adequacy requirement, data from EU subjects often cannot be accessed by reviewers in jurisdictions without adequacy decisions unless additional safeguards are in place. Under HIPAA, reviewers must have a treatment, payment, or operations justification for access. Under state medical privacy laws, some jurisdictions require that reviewers be located in the same state as the patient. Your access control system must enforce all of these rules automatically. If it requires reviewers to self-certify their eligibility, it is not a control. It is a suggestion.

## Identity Lifecycle Management

A reviewer's identity has a lifecycle: onboarding, active use, role changes, leave of absence, offboarding. Each stage requires specific access actions, and each action must be logged.

**Onboarding.** A new reviewer is assigned a unique, stable identifier. This ID is not their email, which may change, and not their employee number, which may be reused. It is a UUID or equivalent that remains theirs for life. The reviewer completes required training before access is granted. The training completion is verified, logged, and linked to their identity. The reviewer is assigned an initial role, and the role assignment is logged with justification and approval. The reviewer is issued credentials through a secure provisioning workflow. Credentials are never sent via email. They are delivered through a secure onboarding portal with two-factor authentication.

**Active use.** The reviewer accesses cases according to their role and attributes. Every access is logged with case ID, timestamp, and access justification. If your system requires reviewers to enter a justification for each case access, that justification is stored in the audit log. If your system infers justification from queue assignment, that queue assignment is logged. If the reviewer accesses a case outside their normal queue, the system flags it as an anomalous access and requires additional justification or manager approval.

**Role changes.** When a reviewer is promoted, their new permissions are added and their old permissions are revoked in a single atomic operation. There is no window where they have both. When a reviewer is temporarily assigned to a different queue, the temporary assignment has a defined end date and is automatically revoked when the date passes. Role changes are logged with the reason, the approver, and the effective date.

**Leave of absence.** When a reviewer goes on leave, their access is suspended, not deleted. Suspension preserves the audit trail while preventing new access. When the reviewer returns, access is restored with the same role and attributes they had before. The suspension and restoration events are both logged.

**Offboarding.** When a reviewer leaves the organization, their access is revoked immediately. Not at end of business. Not at the end of the pay period. Immediately. The revocation is logged with the termination date and reason. The identity record is not deleted. It is marked as inactive and retained for audit purposes. If the reviewer was a contractor and their contract ends, the same process applies. Contractor access does not linger. It ends on the contract end date, and the system enforces that end date automatically.

Every one of these transitions is a logged event. If a reviewer is terminated and accesses a case afterward, that access is a security incident and a compliance breach. The identity system must make it impossible.

## Two-Factor Authentication and Session Management

Reviewers handle sensitive data. Single-factor authentication is insufficient. Every reviewer login must require two independent factors: something they know, something they have, or something they are. Password plus TOTP code. Password plus hardware token. Password plus biometric. The specific method matters less than the enforcement. No reviewer should be able to access case data with a password alone.

Session management is equally critical. A session must expire after a defined period of inactivity. Thirty minutes is standard. For high-sensitivity systems, fifteen minutes. The session must be bound to a specific device and IP address. If the device or IP changes mid-session, the session is invalidated and the user must reauthenticate. This prevents session hijacking and credential sharing.

Shared credentials are prohibited. Each reviewer has their own account. Shared accounts make audit trails useless because you cannot attribute actions to individuals. If two reviewers share an account and one of them makes a bad decision, you cannot determine which one did it. That violates the accountability principle that underlies all compliance frameworks.

If your review system is accessed remotely, the authentication must be stronger. VPN access, certificate-based authentication, or device attestation. The principle is simple: the more sensitive the data, the stronger the identity assurance required before access is granted.

## Least Privilege and Need-to-Know

Reviewers should have access to the minimum data necessary to perform their assigned tasks. A reviewer assigned to Tier 1 content moderation does not need access to financial review queues. A quality analyst reviewing inter-rater agreement does not need to see the full case content, only the decision labels. A compliance auditor reviewing logs does not need access to production case queues.

Need-to-know is enforced through scoped permissions. Permissions are not binary. They are graduated. A reviewer may have read-only access to archived cases but read-write access to active cases. A supervisor may have access to their team's decisions but not to other teams' decisions. An auditor may have access to metadata and decision outcomes but not to PII or case content.

The system must enforce these scopes at every query. A reviewer attempting to access a case outside their scope receives an access denied error, and the attempt is logged. If the system allows the query to succeed but hides the results in the UI, that is not access control. The control must happen at the data layer.

Least privilege also applies temporally. A reviewer who handled a case six months ago does not need ongoing access to that case. Historical access should require justification and logging. If a reviewer needs to review an old case for a quality audit, they request temporary access, provide a reason, receive approval, and the access is logged and auto-revoked after a defined period.

## Access Logs as Evidence

Every reviewer access event is logged. The log captures who accessed what, when, from where, and why. These logs are not operational telemetry. They are legal evidence.

Under GDPR, a data subject can request a list of all individuals who accessed their data. Under HIPAA, a patient can request an access log for their medical records. Your system must be able to generate that report in minutes. The report includes the reviewer's name, their role, the date and time of access, the purpose of access, and the actions taken. If the report cannot be generated, you are in violation.

Access logs are also used for anomaly detection. A reviewer who accesses 10 times more cases than their peers may be exceeding their authority. A reviewer who accesses cases outside their geographic jurisdiction may be violating data residency rules. A reviewer who accesses cases and makes no decision may be browsing inappropriately. These patterns are detectable only if access is logged comprehensively and monitored actively.

The monitoring does not need to be real-time, but it needs to be regular. Weekly access reviews are standard. Monthly reviews are the minimum. The review process is documented, and the reviews themselves are logged. If an anomaly is detected and not acted upon, that inaction becomes evidence of negligence.

## Segregation of Duties

Certain combinations of permissions create compliance risk. A reviewer should not have the ability to both make a decision and approve the audit of that decision. A quality analyst should not have the ability to both label cases and evaluate labeling quality. A system administrator should not have the ability to both configure access controls and review production cases.

Segregation of duties prevents conflicts of interest and reduces fraud risk. It is a core SOX requirement and a best practice in all regulated industries. Your role design must enforce it. If a user needs multiple conflicting roles temporarily, the exception is logged, approved, and time-limited.

The enforcement happens at role definition. Conflicting permissions are never granted to the same role. If a user is assigned two roles and the roles conflict, the system rejects the assignment and requires remediation. This prevents accidental violations.

## The External Auditor Role

Your review infrastructure will be audited. Design for it. Create a read-only auditor role that has access to all logs, all decision records, all policy versions, and all training records, but zero access to modify anything. Grant this role to your internal compliance team and, when needed, to external auditors.

The auditor role must be able to run every query that an audit might require without assistance from engineering. That means a query interface, not raw database access. The interface allows filtering by reviewer, by date, by case type, by decision outcome, and by any other dimension the audit might need. The queries return structured results that can be exported to CSV or Excel for analysis.

If your auditor role requires engineering support to run queries, the audit will take longer, cost more, and create friction between your team and the auditors. Build the role properly and audits become routine administrative events instead of existential crises.

The next subchapter covers data retention policies for review artifacts: what to keep, how long to keep it, and how to delete it compliantly when the retention period ends.
