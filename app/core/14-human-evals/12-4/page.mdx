# 12.4 — Data Retention Policies for Review Artifacts

How long must you keep review artifacts? The answer depends on which regulator is asking. SOX says seven years for financial controls. HIPAA says six years for health data audit logs. The EU AI Act says the operational lifetime of the system for high-risk use cases. GDPR says only as long as necessary for the processing purpose. These requirements overlap, conflict, and change by jurisdiction. A review system that treats retention as a single global policy will either over-retain and violate privacy law or under-retain and violate audit law. You need a retention framework that maps regulatory requirements to artifact types, enforces them automatically, and produces an audit trail of the retention decisions themselves.

Most teams discover their retention policy is wrong during their first regulatory audit. The auditor asks for review records from three years ago. The team produces them instantly because they kept everything. Then the auditor asks why personal data from cases closed three years ago is still in the active database when GDPR requires deletion after the purpose ends. The team has no answer. The retention policy that satisfied one requirement violated another. The penalty is not hypothetical. GDPR fines for excessive retention have reached tens of millions of euros for companies that should have known better.

## The Four Retention Categories

Not all review artifacts are the same. They have different legal purposes, different retention obligations, and different deletion rules. Your retention policy must treat them separately.

**Audit metadata.** This includes reviewer ID, timestamp, decision outcome, action type, case ID, and policy version. Audit metadata proves that a review happened, who did it, and what decision was made. It does not include the case content, the user's personal data, or the model's output. Audit metadata is subject to the longest retention periods because it supports compliance, litigation defense, and regulatory oversight. Under SOX, it is retained for seven years. Under HIPAA, six years. Under the EU AI Act for high-risk systems, the operational lifetime of the system or as required by sector regulation. Audit metadata is not personal data in most cases, so GDPR's deletion requirements do not apply unless the metadata itself identifies an individual in a way that creates privacy risk.

**Case content.** This includes the user's input, the model's output, any attachments, and the full context the reviewer saw. Case content is necessary for reconstructing what the reviewer evaluated. It is also personal data under GDPR if it relates to an identified or identifiable person. Case content must be retained long enough to satisfy audit obligations and short enough to satisfy privacy obligations. The resolution is time-limited retention with anonymization. You retain case content for the period required by the most restrictive audit regulation, then anonymize or delete it. If SOX requires seven years and GDPR allows retention for audit purposes under Article 17(3)(e), you retain for seven years. If no audit obligation applies, you delete when the business purpose ends.

**Decision rationale.** The reviewer's written explanation for their decision. This is personal to the reviewer, not to the data subject, but it may reference case content. Decision rationale is retained as long as the audit metadata because it proves meaningful review. It must be stored separately from case content so it can be preserved when case content is anonymized.

**Access logs.** Records of who viewed which cases and when. Access logs are required under GDPR for subject access requests and under HIPAA for patient access reports. They are retained for the same period as audit metadata because they serve the same compliance purpose. Access logs are personal data with respect to the reviewers whose access is logged, but they are exempt from deletion under GDPR Article 17(3)(b) when retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

Each category has its own retention clock, its own deletion triggers, and its own anonymization rules. A retention policy that treats all artifacts identically will get at least one category wrong.

## Mapping Retention to Regulation

Your retention schedule is not a single number. It is a matrix. One axis is artifact type. The other axis is regulatory regime. The cell values are retention periods and legal bases.

For a financial services company operating in the EU and US, the matrix includes GDPR, SOX, SEC recordkeeping rules, and state financial privacy laws. For a healthcare company, it includes GDPR, HIPAA, HITECH, state health privacy laws, and FDA regulations if the review involves medical devices. For a high-risk AI system under the EU AI Act, it includes the Act's transparency and accountability requirements plus any sector-specific rules.

Each regulation specifies what must be kept and for how long. SOX Section 802 requires retention of audit records for seven years. HIPAA requires retention of audit logs for six years from the date of creation or the date when last in effect, whichever is later. GDPR does not specify retention periods but requires that data be kept no longer than necessary. The EU AI Act Article 12 requires high-risk system logs to be kept for an appropriate period as determined by sector regulation.

The matrix resolves conflicts by choosing the longest required period for each artifact type, then applying GDPR's necessity test. If SOX requires seven years and HIPAA requires six, you retain for seven. If GDPR applies and no audit obligation exists, you retain only as long as the processing purpose requires. If the purposes conflict, you document the conflict and choose the retention period with the strongest legal basis.

The matrix is versioned. When regulations change, the matrix is updated, and the update is logged. Cases created under the old matrix are retained according to the rules in effect at the time of creation. Cases created under the new matrix follow the new rules. You do not retroactively shorten retention periods if doing so would violate an audit obligation. You do retroactively shorten periods if a regulation requires it.

## Retention Start Dates and Triggers

Retention periods do not start when the case is created. They start when the retention trigger occurs. The trigger depends on the artifact type and the regulation.

For audit metadata, the trigger is usually the date of the decision. The seven-year SOX clock starts on the date the reviewer approved or rejected the output, not the date the case was opened. For case content, the trigger may be the date the business purpose ends. If the case involves a customer contract, the retention period may start when the contract ends, not when the case is reviewed. For access logs, the trigger is the date of the last access event.

Different artifacts for the same case can have different retention start dates. The case was opened on March 1, reviewed on March 5, the decision was appealed on April 10, and the appeal was resolved on May 3. The audit metadata retention period starts on May 3 because that is the final decision date. The case content retention period starts on May 3 unless the content is needed for ongoing contract performance, in which case it starts when the contract ends. The access log retention period starts on the date of the last access, which could be months or years later if the case is accessed during a subsequent audit.

Your retention system must track these triggers separately. A single global retention timer per case will produce incorrect deletion dates.

## Anonymization as an Alternative to Deletion

GDPR requires deletion of personal data when it is no longer necessary for the processing purpose. But GDPR also recognizes that anonymized data is not personal data and is not subject to deletion requirements. If you can anonymize case content while preserving its audit value, you satisfy both the privacy obligation and the audit obligation.

Anonymization is not redaction. Redaction hides specific fields but leaves the record otherwise intact. Anonymization removes or transforms the data in a way that makes re-identification impossible. Under GDPR, anonymization must withstand re-identification attempts using all means reasonably likely to be used. That is a high bar.

For review artifacts, effective anonymization means removing or pseudonymizing the data subject identifier, removing direct identifiers like names and email addresses, generalizing quasi-identifiers like dates and locations, and removing free-text fields that might contain identifying information. The model output is summarized or hashed rather than stored verbatim. The case content is replaced with a schema-level description: the case involved a 34-year-old user from Germany who submitted a claim for a specific benefit type. The outcome was approved. The reviewer noted compliance with policy Section 4.2.

This anonymized record retains audit value. It shows that a case was reviewed, by whom, when, with what outcome, and under what policy. It does not retain enough information to re-identify the data subject. The retention period for anonymized records can be longer than for personal data because GDPR no longer applies.

Anonymization is not appropriate for all cases. If the case is subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, you may need to preserve the full record until the matter is resolved. The retention policy must account for legal holds, which suspend normal deletion rules until the hold is lifted.

## Automated Deletion Workflows

Retention policies are useless if they depend on manual enforcement. You need automated deletion workflows that execute retention rules without human intervention.

The workflow runs on a schedule. Weekly is common. Daily for high-volume systems. The workflow queries the retention database for all artifacts whose retention period has ended. It checks for legal holds. It checks for active processing that might extend the retention period. If no exceptions apply, it deletes or anonymizes the artifact according to the policy.

Deletion is scoped. It deletes case content but preserves audit metadata. It deletes PII but preserves decision outcomes. It replaces data subject identifiers with pseudonyms but preserves the link to the audit trail. The deletion is atomic. Either all required deletions for a case succeed, or none do. Partial deletion creates referential integrity violations and compliance gaps.

The deletion event is logged. The log entry includes the case ID, the artifact type, the deletion date, the retention policy rule that triggered the deletion, and the system or user that executed it. This creates an auditable record of compliance with retention obligations. If a regulator asks why data from 2018 no longer exists, the deletion log shows that it was deleted on schedule according to the documented retention policy.

Deletion failures are escalated. If a deletion job fails because of a database lock, a foreign key constraint, or a system error, the failure is logged, an alert is sent to the data governance team, and the deletion is retried. Failures are not ignored. A retention policy that fails silently is not a policy.

## Legal Holds and Exceptions

Retention policies have exceptions. The most common is a legal hold. When litigation is filed, when a regulatory investigation begins, or when an internal investigation is opened, all relevant data is placed on hold. The hold prevents deletion even if the retention period has expired. The data is preserved until the hold is lifted.

Legal holds are managed through a hold registry. The registry tracks which cases, which artifact types, and which date ranges are on hold. The registry includes the reason for the hold, the date it was imposed, and the authority that imposed it. The automated deletion workflow checks the hold registry before deleting anything. If a case is on hold, the deletion is skipped and the skip is logged.

Holds are scoped. A hold for a specific lawsuit affects only the cases relevant to that lawsuit. It does not freeze the entire review database. The scope is defined by case attributes: cases involving a specific user, a specific product, a specific time period, or a specific decision type. The hold system must support complex scoping queries.

Holds are time-limited when possible. A hold imposed for a regulatory investigation ends when the investigation closes. The hold registry is reviewed periodically to identify holds that are no longer necessary. Holds that remain active indefinitely are a retention policy failure.

Other exceptions include active processing, ongoing appeals, and data needed for critical business operations. A case that is under appeal cannot be deleted until the appeal is resolved. A case that is referenced in an active customer support ticket cannot be deleted until the ticket is closed. These exceptions are tracked in the retention system, and the retention clock is paused or reset as needed.

## Retention Policy Documentation and Governance

Your retention policy is a compliance artifact. It must be documented, approved, versioned, and accessible to auditors.

The documentation specifies the retention period for each artifact type, the legal basis for each period, the deletion method, the anonymization method, and the exceptions. It includes the retention matrix, the trigger definitions, and the workflow descriptions. It is written in plain language that a non-technical auditor can understand.

The policy is approved by Legal, Compliance, and the business owner of the review system. Approval is documented and dated. The policy is reviewed annually and updated when regulations change. Updates are versioned, and the version history is retained.

The policy is accessible. It is published in an internal policy repository where auditors, regulators, and employees can find it. It is referenced in data processing agreements, privacy policies, and vendor contracts. If your review system is provided as a service to other organizations, the retention policy is part of the service documentation.

Governance includes regular audits of compliance with the policy. The audit checks that deletions are happening on schedule, that legal holds are being respected, that anonymization is effective, and that the deletion logs are complete. The audit is performed by an independent team, not by the team that operates the review system. The audit results are documented and any deficiencies are remediated.

## The Retention Communication Plan

When data is deleted, affected parties may need to be notified. If a user requests their data and it has been deleted in compliance with the retention policy, you must inform them that the data no longer exists and provide the deletion date. If a regulator requests data that has been deleted, you must provide the deletion log entry that proves compliant deletion.

The communication plan specifies who is notified, when, and how. It includes templates for deletion confirmations, retention policy summaries, and audit responses. The plan is tested before the first deletion event.

The plan also covers accidental deletions. If data is deleted in error, the incident is logged, investigated, and reported according to your incident response policy. If the deleted data included personal data, GDPR may require breach notification. The retention system must distinguish between policy-compliant deletion and accidental deletion, and the distinction must be clear in the logs.

Retention is not a one-time decision. It is an ongoing operational discipline. The infrastructure must support it, the policy must govern it, and the team must execute it. Done correctly, retention becomes a source of compliance confidence. Done incorrectly, it becomes the reason your next audit fails.
