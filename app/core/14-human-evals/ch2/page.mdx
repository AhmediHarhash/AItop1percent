# Chapter 2 — Review Queue Architecture

The queue is where review work lives before it becomes reviewed work. Queue architecture determines whether your review operation scales gracefully or collapses under load, whether high-priority items get timely attention or rot alongside everything else, whether reviewers work efficiently or spend their days fighting a system that fights back. Most teams treat queues as simple to-do lists. The teams that scale treat queues as distributed systems requiring the same engineering rigor as production infrastructure.

*A well-designed queue disappears from the reviewer's consciousness. A poorly-designed queue dominates every conversation about why work is not getting done.*
