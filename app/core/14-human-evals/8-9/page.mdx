# 8.9 — Legal Hold Workflows: Preserving Artifacts for Investigation

In November 2025, a healthcare AI company received a subpoena demanding all records related to a patient whose medical summary had been flagged as unsafe by their review team eight months earlier. The company had the decision label. They had the timestamp. They had the reviewer's username. What they did not have was the original item text, the reviewer's rationale, the policy version cited, or the metadata the model had returned. Their retention policy archived review artifacts after six months to save storage costs. The items under subpoena had been deleted. The company settled the case for $1.8 million rather than face sanctions for spoliation of evidence — the legal term for destroying records that should have been preserved. The failure was not malicious. It was procedural. The company had no legal hold workflow.

A legal hold is the process of identifying, freezing, and preserving all records related to pending or anticipated litigation, regulatory investigation, or internal inquiry. When a legal hold is triggered, normal retention and deletion policies are suspended for the records in scope. Nothing related to the matter can be altered, deleted, or purged until the hold is lifted. For human review operations, this means preserving not just the items under review, but the full context of every decision: who reviewed it, when, what they saw, what they decided, and why.

Legal holds are triggered with little warning — a regulator's request, a plaintiff's discovery demand, an internal investigation into reviewer conduct. Your review infrastructure must be ready to freeze records instantly, preserve them immutably, and produce them when required. This is not optional. Failure to preserve records under legal hold can result in sanctions, adverse inference rulings, or destruction of your legal position regardless of the underlying merits.

## When Legal Holds Apply

Legal holds apply whenever there is a reasonable expectation that records may be relevant to a legal or regulatory proceeding. The standard is not certainty — it is anticipation. If you receive a demand letter, a regulatory inquiry, or notice of a lawsuit, a hold is mandatory. If your Legal team is investigating an internal incident that could escalate, a hold may be appropriate even before external parties are involved.

Litigation triggers automatic holds. If your company is sued, and the lawsuit involves AI outputs, content moderation decisions, or model behavior reviewed by your team, all related review records must be preserved. This includes the items under review, the decision labels, the reviewer rationales, the policy versions in effect at the time, and any escalations, disagreements, or appeals. A social media platform facing a wrongful termination lawsuit over content moderation decisions placed a legal hold on all moderation records for the plaintiff's account and any accounts they interacted with, spanning eighteen months.

Regulatory investigations trigger holds. If a regulator requests records under the EU AI Act, FDA review, FTC inquiry, or banking examination, the records in scope must be frozen immediately. Regulators expect preservation the moment the inquiry begins, not when they issue a formal subpoena. A financial AI company received an inquiry from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about bias in credit decisioning. Legal placed a hold on all review records for credit model outputs spanning three years, covering hundreds of thousands of decisions.

Internal investigations may trigger holds if they could escalate to external proceedings. If your Trust and Safety team is investigating potential reviewer misconduct, GDPR violations, or systematic labeling errors, Legal may advise a precautionary hold. The reasoning: if the internal investigation uncovers wrongdoing, external parties will want the records. If you deleted them before the external claim materialized, you face spoliation risk. A customer support AI platform investigating allegations that reviewers were overriding safety flags to meet SLA targets placed a hold on all override decisions for six months while the investigation proceeded.

Threatened litigation triggers holds before formal claims are filed. If a user sends a demand letter threatening to sue over a moderation decision, or a business partner threatens litigation over contract AI performance, Legal may issue a hold even if no lawsuit has been filed. The safe practice is to preserve when litigation is reasonably foreseeable, not when it is certain. A legal document review platform received a letter from a law firm alleging that an AI summary missed a critical clause, leading to a failed merger. Legal immediately placed a hold on all review records related to the contract in question, even though no lawsuit had been filed yet.

Holds are issued proactively, not retroactively. You cannot wait until you are confident litigation will happen. By the time you are confident, the records may already be gone. A hold is a defensive measure that protects your ability to defend yourself or comply with obligations. The cost of over-preserving is storage. The cost of under-preserving is sanctions, adverse rulings, or losing the case.

## What Must Be Preserved Under Legal Hold

A legal hold does not just freeze the item under review. It freezes the entire decision context — everything needed to reconstruct what happened and why.

The item itself must be preserved exactly as the reviewer saw it. If the item is a text output, a customer message, a medical summary, or a financial prediction, the full text must be frozen. If the item includes metadata — model confidence scores, source attributions, timestamps, formatting — the metadata must be preserved. If the item has been edited, corrected, or enriched since the decision, both the original and current versions must be kept, with clear timestamps showing what the reviewer saw versus what exists now. A healthcare platform preserving discharge summaries under legal hold maintains both the raw model output reviewed by the clinician and the final version released to the patient, with version control showing when changes occurred.

The decision label and all associated fields must be preserved. This includes the binary classification, the severity rating, the confidence level, any tags or categories applied, and any structured fields the reviewer filled out. If the decision was later overturned, both the original and revised labels must be kept with timestamps.

The reviewer rationale must be preserved verbatim. If the reviewer wrote a free-text explanation, flagged specific sentences, cited policy sections, or attached reference examples, all of that is evidence. Rationales should never be summarized, paraphrased, or compressed under legal hold — preserve the exact text. A financial review platform under legal hold exports reviewer rationales as immutable text files with cryptographic checksums to prove no tampering.

The reviewer's identity must be preserved. This includes the reviewer's user ID, role, tier level, training status at the time of decision, and whether they were flagged for any calibration or quality issues. If the decision was escalated to a senior reviewer or involved consensus from multiple reviewers, all participants must be logged. Anonymizing reviewer identity under legal hold is generally prohibited unless the hold order explicitly allows it.

The policy version cited must be preserved. If the reviewer referenced a specific section of a content policy, medical guideline, or compliance rule, the full policy document in the version that was active at decision time must be preserved. If policy versioning is not rigorous, you may not be able to produce the correct version — this is why version control is critical. A content moderation platform preserves a snapshot of the entire policy library as it existed at the date of each decision under hold.

Metadata about the review session must be preserved. This includes the timestamp of the decision, the duration the reviewer spent on the item, the interface version they used, which other items they reviewed in the same session, and whether they took breaks or requested help. Session metadata helps establish context and can defend against claims that reviewers were rushed, fatigued, or lacked necessary information. A legal document review operation under hold preserves session logs showing that reviewers had access to reference materials and were not exceeding recommended hourly review limits.

Escalations, disagreements, and appeals must be preserved. If a decision was disputed, overturned, or required manager input, the full chain of escalation must be kept. This includes the original decision, the escalation request, the senior reviewer's response, and any final resolution. If multiple reviewers disagreed, all rationales must be preserved, not just the final consensus.

Audit logs showing who accessed the item and when must be preserved. If an item was reviewed, then re-reviewed, then accessed by a manager, then pulled for calibration, the access log is evidence of the item's lifecycle. Access logs can defend against claims that decisions were hidden or manipulated. They can also reveal problems — if access logs show that a decision was modified after the fact, that is critical evidence either for or against you.

Training records for the reviewers involved must be preserved. If the decision is challenged on the grounds that the reviewer was unqualified or improperly trained, you need proof of their training status, calibration scores, and performance metrics at the time of the decision. A healthcare review platform under hold preserves not just the decision records but the training transcripts and calibration results for every reviewer whose decisions are in scope.

## Hold Notification and Acknowledgment

Legal holds are typically issued by your Legal team via formal notice to all custodians — the people or systems that control the records. For human review operations, custodians include the review platform team, the data engineering team managing storage, and sometimes individual reviewers if they have local copies of records.

Hold notices must be explicit about scope. The notice should define which records are covered by date range, item type, decision category, reviewer identity, or any other filter. Vague hold notices like "preserve all moderation records" are risky — teams interpret scope differently. A well-drafted hold notice specifies: "Preserve all review decisions for account ID 482394, all decisions made by reviewers in the Trust and Safety Tier 3 team between March 1 and June 15, 2025, and all escalations or appeals related to hate speech classifications during that period."

Custodians must acknowledge the hold in writing. Acknowledgment is proof that the custodian received the notice, understands the scope, and has taken steps to comply. Without acknowledgment, Legal cannot prove the hold was communicated. A financial AI platform requires all custodians to reply to hold notices within 24 hours confirming that automated deletions have been suspended and relevant records have been flagged for preservation.

Automated systems must be suspended. If your review platform has automated data retention policies that delete records after 90 days, six months, or a year, those policies must be overridden for records under hold. This requires either excluding held records from deletion jobs or pausing deletion entirely for the affected scope. A customer support AI platform implements legal hold flags in the database — any record flagged for hold is skipped by automated purge scripts, and attempts to delete flagged records trigger alerts to Legal.

Hold notices must be reissued if scope expands. If the initial hold covered one user account and the investigation later expands to ten accounts, a supplemental hold notice must be issued. Custodians cannot be expected to guess that scope has grown. A content moderation platform tracks all active legal holds in a centralized system, and when scope changes, Legal updates the hold definition and re-notifies all custodians.

Violations of legal hold must be reported immediately. If a custodian discovers that records under hold were accidentally deleted, altered, or moved, they must notify Legal immediately. Early disclosure allows damage control. Concealing the loss is catastrophic. A healthcare review platform discovered that a database migration inadvertently deleted metadata for items under legal hold. The platform's engineering team notified Legal within hours, and Legal disclosed the issue to opposing counsel immediately, mitigating the risk of sanctions.

## Hold Duration and Periodic Review

Legal holds remain in effect until Legal formally lifts them. They do not expire automatically. The duration depends on the lifecycle of the underlying matter — litigation can take years, regulatory investigations can stretch even longer.

Holds persist through the entire lifecycle of the matter. If litigation is filed, the hold remains in effect through discovery, trial, appeal, and final judgment. If the matter settles, the hold typically remains in place until the settlement is final and any appeal periods have expired. A social media platform held moderation records under legal hold for four years while a class action lawsuit proceeded through discovery, trial, appeal, and final settlement approval.

Periodic review ensures holds are still necessary. Legal should review active holds quarterly or semi-annually to determine if they can be lifted. If litigation settled six months ago and no further claims are expected, the hold can be lifted and normal retention policies resume. Failing to review holds results in permanent accumulation of preserved data, driving up storage costs and complicating data governance.

Lifting a hold requires formal notice. Just as custodians must be notified when a hold begins, they must be notified when it ends. Until the lift notice is received, custodians must continue preserving records. A financial AI platform maintains a legal hold registry where Legal logs the start date, scope, responsible custodians, and lift date for every hold. When a hold is lifted, an automated email notifies all custodians and logs the acknowledgment.

Preserved records may still be subject to retention requirements after the hold is lifted. Lifting a legal hold does not mean immediate deletion. If the records are subject to HIPAA's six-year retention or SOX's seven-year retention, they must continue to be stored under those rules even after the legal hold ends. The hold simply means they could not be deleted even if the retention period had expired during the hold.

## Integration with Legal and Compliance Systems

Legal holds do not operate in isolation. They must integrate with your broader legal, compliance, and data governance infrastructure.

Legal hold management systems track all active holds centrally. These systems log the matter name, the custodians, the scope, the start date, the responsible attorney, and the status. Integration with your review platform allows the legal hold system to automatically flag records in scope, preventing deletion. A multinational corporation uses a legal hold platform that integrates with their review database via API — when Legal creates a hold, the system automatically tags matching records and suspends deletion policies.

eDiscovery platforms may be used to collect and produce held records. When a regulator or opposing counsel requests records under hold, you need to export them in a legally defensible format. eDiscovery tools allow you to search, filter, deduplicate, and produce records with metadata intact. A legal document review operation exports held records to Relativity, a widely used eDiscovery platform, where Legal can review and produce them in response to discovery requests.

Compliance monitoring flags hold violations. Your compliance system should alert if records under hold are accessed inappropriately, modified, or deleted. Alerts should go to both the custodian and Legal. A healthcare platform uses database triggers to log any write or delete operation on records flagged for legal hold, and the compliance team reviews the logs weekly for anomalies.

Audit trails must be exportable for litigation. When you produce records under hold, you also produce the audit trail showing the chain of custody. This proves the records are authentic and unaltered. A financial review platform exports not just the decision records but the full audit log showing when each record was created, accessed, preserved under hold, and produced.

The next subchapter covers appeals processes — the formal mechanism by which users, stakeholders, or reviewers can challenge a decision, request re-review, and obtain independent judgment on disputed outcomes.
