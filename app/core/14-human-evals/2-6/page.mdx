# 2.6 — Queue Depth and Backlog Management

How deep is too deep? A queue with 50 items feels manageable. A queue with 500 feels overwhelming. A queue with 5,000 feels hopeless. The number that separates manageable from overwhelming depends on capacity, but the psychological shift is universal. When a reviewer looks at the queue and believes it can never be cleared, they stop treating each case as important. The queue depth you allow determines the quality you get. A backlog is technical debt with interest. The longer it persists, the more damage it does.

## Measuring Queue Health

Queue health is not a single number. It is a distribution. A queue with 200 cases where 190 arrived in the last hour and 10 arrived yesterday is healthy. A queue with 200 cases where 10 arrived in the last hour and 190 arrived last week is dying. The depth matters, but the age distribution matters more. A shallow queue with old cases signals chronic underperformance. A deep queue with fresh cases signals a temporary surge.

The first metric is total depth: the count of unassigned cases in the queue. Total depth is the most visible metric and the least informative. Depth alone does not indicate whether the queue is growing, shrinking, or stable. A queue at 400 cases today and 400 cases yesterday is stable. A queue at 400 cases today and 300 cases yesterday is growing by 100 per day. The trend matters more than the snapshot.

The second metric is age distribution: the histogram of case ages in the queue. A healthy queue has most cases under 1 hour old, a small number under 4 hours old, and almost none over 24 hours old. An unhealthy queue has a long tail of cases over 48 hours old. The tail cases are backlog. They are cases that have aged out of their SLA and are waiting for someone to acknowledge them as late. The longer the tail, the sicker the queue.

The third metric is growth rate: the difference between inflow and outflow. A queue receiving 100 cases per hour and completing 100 cases per hour is stable at whatever depth it started. A queue receiving 120 cases per hour and completing 100 cases per hour is growing by 20 per hour. If the growth rate is positive for more than 4 hours, the queue will not self-correct. Intervention is required. The growth rate is the early warning signal. By the time depth becomes alarming, the queue has been unhealthy for hours.

The fourth metric is SLA risk: the count of cases within 1 hour of their SLA deadline. A case with a 4-hour SLA that has been in the queue for 3 hours is at risk. SLA risk is a leading indicator of SLA breach. If SLA risk is high, SLA breach is imminent unless capacity increases or cases are triaged. The metric allows proactive response. By the time SLA breach happens, the damage is done. SLA risk allows prevention.

## Acceptable Depth Targets

Acceptable depth is the depth at which reviewers remain effective, SLAs remain achievable, and the system can absorb a surge without collapse. The target is not zero. A queue at zero depth means reviewers are waiting for work. Underutilization is waste. The target is also not infinite. A queue growing without bound eventually causes SLA collapse. The target is the depth that balances throughput, quality, and resilience.

For stream queues, acceptable depth is one to two hours of work at current capacity. If the team completes 100 cases per hour, acceptable depth is 100 to 200 cases. At 100 cases, reviewers are fully utilized without waiting. At 200 cases, the queue has buffer to absorb a temporary surge or a temporary capacity drop. At 300 cases, the queue is entering stress. At 500 cases, the queue is in failure.

For batch queues, acceptable depth is the count of batches scheduled for the current period. If the team completes 4 batches per week and the week has just started, acceptable depth is 4 batches. If the queue contains 6 batches, the team is over capacity for the week. The two extra batches will either miss their deadline or require overtime. Both outcomes are failure. Acceptable batch depth enforces capacity planning. The system cannot accept more batch work than the team can complete in the batch period.

Acceptable depth also varies by SLA. A queue with a 15-minute SLA cannot tolerate the same depth as a queue with a 4-hour SLA. A 15-minute SLA queue at 50 cases is at risk if the team completes 30 cases per hour. Half the queue is approaching SLA breach. A 4-hour SLA queue at 50 cases is comfortable if the team completes 30 cases per hour. The entire queue can be cleared in under 2 hours. The SLA determines the acceptable depth. The stricter the SLA, the shallower the acceptable depth.

The system must enforce acceptable depth through admission control. When depth exceeds the acceptable threshold, the system stops accepting new low-priority cases. High-priority cases continue to flow. Low-priority cases are rejected or queued to a separate backlog. The rejection is explicit and logged. The upstream system that submitted the case receives a rejection notice: queue over capacity, retry in 1 hour. The rejection prevents the queue from growing unbounded. It also creates backpressure on the systems generating review work. If the queue is perpetually over capacity, the organization must either increase review capacity or reduce case generation.

## Backlog Triage

Backlog is the set of cases that have exceeded their SLA or are certain to exceed it before they can be reviewed. Backlog is failure that has already happened. The question is what to do with it. The worst answer is to mix backlog with current work and pretend both are equal priority. A reviewer working a queue that mixes today's cases with last week's cases cannot tell which cases are urgent. The mixing creates confusion and deprives the organization of the ability to make intentional triage decisions.

Backlog must be separated into a distinct queue. The backlog queue is clearly labeled: these cases are late. The separation creates visibility. Leadership sees the backlog size and age. The review team sees that current work is current and backlog work is backlog. The distinction allows different handling. Current work is assigned to maintain SLAs. Backlog work is assigned during surplus capacity or handled through dedicated backlog reduction sprints.

Triage means deciding what in the backlog still matters. Not every case in the backlog must be reviewed. A content moderation case from 3 days ago may no longer be relevant. The content was either already escalated by another signal or has aged out of user visibility. Reviewing it now provides no value. The case should be closed as expired. A quality audit case from last week still matters. The audit is not time-sensitive. It can be completed late without losing value. The case stays in the backlog for eventual review.

Triage is a policy decision, not a technical one. The policy specifies which case types can expire and under what conditions. A case type with a 1-hour SLA that is now 48 hours old is a candidate for expiration. A case type with no SLA that is 7 days old may still be valid. The policy is explicit and documented. A reviewer does not decide which cases to expire. The system applies the policy automatically. The reviewer is presented only with cases that the policy says still require review.

The backlog queue should also support priority re-ordering. A case that entered the backlog at low priority may have become high priority due to external events. A low-priority user complaint about a model output becomes high-priority when the same user escalates to legal. The case must be promoted from backlog to active queue at high priority. The promotion is manual or triggered by upstream system signals. The backlog is not a dead queue. It is a deprioritized queue with the possibility of revival.

## The Psychology of Infinite Queues

A reviewer looking at an infinite queue believes the work will never be done. The belief changes behavior. They rush cases to make visible progress. They skip steps to move faster. They stop flagging edge cases because adding complexity feels like slowing down. The queue depth creates pressure. The pressure creates shortcuts. The shortcuts create errors. The errors create rework. The rework increases queue depth. The cycle is self-reinforcing.

The psychological threshold for "infinite" is lower than the technical threshold. A queue does not need to be literally unbounded to feel infinite. A queue at 3 days of work feels infinite to a reviewer who sees it at the start of their shift. The reviewer knows they cannot make meaningful progress. The knowledge demotivates. The demotivation reduces productivity. The reduced productivity makes the queue deeper. The cycle repeats.

Breaking the cycle requires capping visible queue depth. The reviewer sees only the cases assigned to them or available for their next assignment. They do not see the full queue depth. A reviewer assigned 40 cases for their shift sees 40 cases. They do not see that 800 more cases are waiting. The cap protects the reviewer from the psychological damage of the infinite queue. It does not fix the capacity problem. It prevents the capacity problem from compounding through demoralization.

Visible caps must be paired with realistic workload. A reviewer assigned 40 cases for a shift where they can complete 35 knows they will fall short. The shortfall is demotivating even if they cannot see the 800 cases behind them. The assignment must match capacity. A reviewer assigned 30 cases for a shift where they can complete 35 feels accomplishment when they finish early and pull additional cases. The slack is motivating. The assignment strategy that pushes every reviewer to 100 percent of capacity eliminates the possibility of accomplishment. The elimination is psychologically corrosive.

## Visible vs Hidden Backlog

Some organizations hide the backlog to prevent reviewer demoralization. The backlog exists, but reviewers are not told about it. They see only the current queue. The strategy works in the very short term. It fails in the long term because the backlog leaks. A reviewer hears from a colleague that cases from last week are still unreviewed. A reviewer notices case IDs that suggest the case was submitted days ago. A reviewer sees reports showing SLA miss rates at 40 percent. The hidden backlog becomes known. The discovery is more demoralizing than transparency would have been because it adds distrust.

Visible backlog is correct. The reviewers know the backlog exists, how large it is, and what the organization is doing about it. The transparency builds trust. The reviewer sees that the backlog is being addressed through capacity expansion, triage, or expectation adjustment. They see that leadership is not pretending the problem does not exist. The visibility also enables contribution. A reviewer with surplus capacity can volunteer to work backlog cases. A reviewer with relevant expertise can prioritize backlog cases in their domain. The contribution is only possible if the backlog is visible.

Visibility requires context. A backlog of 2,000 cases sounds catastrophic. A backlog of 2,000 cases with 1,800 triaged as expired and 200 remaining for review sounds manageable. The context is the difference between panic and planning. The report must show not just backlog size but backlog composition: how many cases are in triage, how many are expired, how many are waiting for review, how many are being actively worked.

Visibility also requires a plan. The backlog exists, and here is what we are doing: hiring 3 additional reviewers starting next month, running a 2-week backlog sprint, renegotiating SLAs with stakeholders, implementing admission control to prevent growth. The plan does not have to eliminate the backlog overnight. It has to show that the backlog is being managed, not ignored. A visible backlog with a plan is a problem being solved. A visible backlog without a plan is a crisis.

## Backlog Reduction Strategies

Backlog reduction is not the same as queue processing. Queue processing is steady-state work. Backlog reduction is a temporary sprint to clear accumulated debt. The strategies differ. Steady-state strategies optimize for sustainable quality. Backlog reduction strategies optimize for volume with acceptable quality floors.

The first strategy is surge capacity. The organization temporarily adds reviewers. The additional reviewers may be contractors, borrowed from other teams, or existing team members working overtime. The surge is time-limited: 2 weeks, not 6 months. The goal is to clear the backlog and return to steady-state capacity. Surge capacity is expensive. It is justified when the backlog is causing material harm: SLA penalties, user churn, regulatory risk.

The second strategy is triage-first. Before attempting to clear the backlog, triage every case. Mark cases that can be expired, cases that can be automated, and cases that require human review. The triage reduces the backlog by 30 to 60 percent in most cases. The remaining cases are reviewed by humans. The triage investment pays for itself in avoided review time. A team that tries to review every backlog case without triage wastes capacity on cases that should have been closed.

The third strategy is quality tier adjustment. Backlog cases are reviewed to a lower quality bar than current cases. The review is faster but less thorough. The tradeoff is explicit: clear the backlog at acceptable quality rather than maintain the backlog indefinitely at perfect quality. The quality floor is defined: all cases receive basic checks, but deep analysis and edge case discussion are skipped. The tier adjustment is temporary. Once the backlog is cleared, quality returns to normal.

The fourth strategy is batching. Backlog cases are grouped by type and reviewed in large batches. A batch of 500 similar cases is assigned to 10 reviewers for a dedicated 4-hour session. The batching reduces context switching and increases throughput. The session is focused: no interruptions, no other work. The team completes the batch and immediately sees the backlog shrink. The visible progress is motivating and builds momentum for the next batch.

## Temporary Capacity Injection

Temporary capacity is not permanent hiring. It is short-term surge support to address acute backlog. The most common source is contractors. Contractors are hired for 2 to 8 weeks, trained on the specific backlog work, and assigned only backlog cases. The contractors do not work current cases. The separation ensures that permanent staff maintains quality on current work while the backlog is addressed.

Contractors must be trained. A contractor thrown into review work without training produces low-quality decisions that create more problems than they solve. The training is condensed but complete: policy overview, tooling walkthrough, calibration on 20 sample cases, shadow review of 10 cases with feedback. The training takes 1 to 2 days. The investment is required. An untrained contractor is not capacity. They are risk.

Contractors must also be monitored. Spot-check 10 percent of contractor reviews daily. If accuracy is below threshold, provide feedback immediately. If accuracy does not improve, end the contract. A contractor producing 50 percent accurate reviews at high speed is not reducing backlog. They are creating a secondary backlog of cases that must be re-reviewed.

Another source of temporary capacity is cross-team borrowing. A team with surplus capacity lends reviewers to a team with backlog. The borrowed reviewers work the backlog for 1 to 2 weeks, then return to their home team. The borrowing works best when the review tasks are similar. A content moderation team lending reviewers to a quality audit team requires minimal retraining. A legal review team lending reviewers to a medical record review team requires extensive retraining and may not be feasible.

Overtime is the least desirable source of temporary capacity. Overtime burns out the team. A reviewer working 50 hours per week for 4 weeks produces lower quality than the same reviewer working 40 hours per week. The extra 10 hours per week are not 25 percent more capacity. They are 10 percent more capacity at 70 percent quality. Overtime is acceptable for 1 week to address a crisis. Overtime as a backlog strategy is professional negligence.

## The Admission Control Question

Admission control is the decision to stop accepting new work when the queue is over capacity. The decision is controversial. Stakeholders expect the review system to accept all work. Rejecting work feels like failure. This is backwards. Accepting unbounded work when capacity is finite is failure. Rejecting work to protect quality and SLAs is operational discipline.

Admission control requires clear rejection policies. The policy specifies the conditions under which new cases are rejected. When queue depth exceeds 400 cases, reject all new low-priority cases. When queue age exceeds 12 hours average, reject all new cases except high-severity. The policy is automatic. A human does not decide whether to reject each case. The system applies the policy. The human decides whether to override the policy for exceptional cases.

Rejected cases must have a clear path. The rejection message tells the submitter what to do: retry in 1 hour, escalate to high-priority if urgent, submit to alternate review channel. The rejection is not a dead end. It is a redirect. The submitter knows the case was not lost. It was deferred or rerouted. The clarity reduces frustration and enables the submitter to take appropriate action.

Admission control also creates upstream accountability. If the review queue is perpetually over capacity and rejecting cases daily, the systems generating review work are producing more than the organization can handle. The organization must either increase review capacity, decrease case generation, or accept that some cases will not be reviewed. The admission control data surfaces the mismatch. The data enables the capacity conversation that leadership must have. The alternative is silent failure: accepting all cases, missing all SLAs, and blaming the review team for underperformance.

Your queue depth determines whether reviewers see a manageable challenge or an infinite burden, whether backlog is addressed or ignored, and whether capacity limits are enforced or silently exceeded. Next, we examine SLA enforcement, and how to make service level agreements meaningful rather than aspirational.
