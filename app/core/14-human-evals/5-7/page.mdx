# 5.7 — Outsourcing vs In-House: The Expertise Trade-off

In August 2025, a B2B SaaS company outsourced 90 percent of their human review operations to a large annotation vendor. The vendor promised faster scaling, lower costs, and quality parity with the in-house team. The company kept two senior reviewers in-house as quality leads and moved everyone else off payroll. Three months later, customer escalations had doubled. The vendor's reviewers were technically accurate — they followed rubrics, hit precision targets, and completed volume on schedule. But they did not understand the product. They flagged outputs that were technically correct but stylistically unusual. They approved outputs that were technically correct but contextually inappropriate for specific customer industries. The in-house team had carried institutional knowledge the rubric could not capture, and the vendor had no way to learn it.

The decision to outsource human review is not a cost question. It is an expertise question. Some review work is mechanical — apply a rubric, check for violations, flag edge cases for escalation. That work can move to a vendor if the rubric is complete and the domain is stable. Other review work requires judgment that comes from living inside the product: understanding user intent, recognizing when technically correct outputs miss the mark, knowing which edge cases are rare bugs versus emerging patterns. That work cannot be outsourced unless you are willing to invest months in knowledge transfer and ongoing calibration, at which point the cost savings evaporate.

The mistake most teams make is treating outsourcing as a volume decision. When review work scales beyond the in-house team's capacity, they assume the obvious move is to hire a vendor. Sometimes that is correct. Often it is not. The right framework is not volume — it is whether the work requires context the vendor can learn or context that requires being embedded in the organization.

## What Can Be Outsourced

Outsourcing works when the task is decomposable into a rubric that transfers cleanly. Content moderation for clear policy violations — hate speech, graphic violence, spam — outsources well. The policy is explicit. The examples are unambiguous. The edge cases are rare enough that you can route them to in-house specialists. A vendor can train reviewers to 90 percent accuracy in two weeks and maintain quality with monthly calibration sessions.

Data labeling for structured tasks outsources well. Bounding boxes around objects in images. Sentiment labels on product reviews. Named entity recognition in customer support transcripts. These tasks require attention and consistency, but they do not require understanding why the data matters or how it will be used. The rubric is the entire job. A vendor can scale from 10 reviewers to 200 in a month without quality degradation, as long as you have a calibration process and a sampling strategy to catch drift.

First-pass triage outsources well if you keep escalation in-house. A vendor can review customer support tickets, categorize them by type, and route obvious cases to the right team. They cannot handle the ambiguous tickets where the customer's request does not fit any category cleanly, or where the right answer depends on account history the vendor does not have access to. But if you design the workflow so that ambiguous cases escalate to in-house specialists, the vendor handles 70 percent of volume and the in-house team focuses on the 30 percent that requires judgment.

Adversarial testing for known attack patterns outsources reasonably well. If you have a library of 500 jailbreak attempts, prompt injections, and adversarial inputs, a vendor can test your model against all of them and report which ones succeed. They are not discovering new attacks — they are executing a test suite. That is mechanical work. The in-house team's job is to analyze the results, understand why certain attacks worked, and design mitigations. The vendor runs the tests. The in-house team interprets them.

## What Must Stay In-House

Product quality judgment must stay in-house. A vendor can tell you whether an AI-generated email is grammatically correct, polite, and on-topic. They cannot tell you whether it sounds like your brand, whether it will resonate with a specific customer segment, or whether it is technically correct but strategically wrong for this context. That judgment requires understanding the product, the users, and the business strategy. It cannot be taught in a rubric because the rubric would need to encode years of implicit product knowledge.

Edge case adjudication must stay in-house. When a reviewer encounters a case that does not fit the rubric — an output that is neither clearly correct nor clearly wrong, or a user input that the system was never designed to handle — someone needs to make a judgment call. That call requires understanding the system's goals, the acceptable risk level, and the downstream consequences of each decision. A vendor can escalate the case, but they cannot resolve it. If you outsource edge case resolution, you are outsourcing product decisions.

Rubric evolution must stay in-house. Rubrics are not static. They evolve as the product changes, as user behavior shifts, and as edge cases reveal gaps in the criteria. Updating a rubric requires understanding why the current version is failing and what the new version should prioritize. A vendor can report that a rubric is ambiguous or incomplete — they will see high inter-rater disagreement or frequent escalations. But they cannot redesign the rubric, because they do not have the product context to know what trade-offs are acceptable. The in-house team owns rubric design. The vendor executes it.

Calibration and quality audits must stay in-house. Someone needs to review the vendor's work, identify systematic errors, and decide whether those errors are acceptable or require retraining. That someone must understand the system's goals and the cost of each error type. You can use a second vendor to audit the first vendor's work, but only if the second vendor has the same level of product context — which they usually do not. The safer model is to keep a small in-house team responsible for ongoing quality oversight, even if 90 percent of volume runs through a vendor.

## Vendor Selection Criteria

Choosing a vendor is not about finding the lowest per-unit cost. It is about finding a partner who can maintain quality at scale while adapting to your product's evolution. The criteria that matter are not in the sales deck — they are in the operational details.

Start with domain expertise. Does the vendor have experience in your domain, or are they treating your work as generic data labeling? A vendor who has done content moderation for social platforms will understand the nuances of harmful content in a way a vendor who has only labeled images will not. A vendor who has done medical document review will understand clinical terminology and the stakes of errors in a way a generalist vendor will not. Domain expertise reduces the time to competence and improves the ceiling of quality the vendor can achieve.

Evaluate their quality infrastructure. How do they measure inter-rater agreement? How often do they run calibration sessions? What is their process for identifying and retraining low-performing reviewers? Do they track quality by reviewer, by task, and by client, or do they report a single blended accuracy number? The best vendors treat quality as a product, not a checkbox. They have dashboards, they run audits, and they proactively report when quality is slipping before you notice it in production.

Understand their flexibility. Can they adapt rubrics mid-project, or do rubric changes require renegotiating the contract? Can they scale up or down on short notice, or are you locked into fixed capacity? Can they handle multiple task types with different rubrics and quality bars, or do they need every task to fit the same workflow? The vendor who can adapt quickly is worth a premium over the vendor who is optimized for a single stable task at massive scale.

Ask about their reviewer workforce. Are reviewers employees or contractors? How long do reviewers stay in the role on average? What is the training process for new reviewers? High turnover degrades quality because you are constantly retraining. A vendor with 40 percent annual turnover will struggle to maintain institutional knowledge. A vendor with 10 percent turnover can build a team that understands your product over time. Stability matters more than headcount.

## Knowledge Transfer and Onboarding

The hardest part of outsourcing is not selecting a vendor. It is transferring the knowledge your in-house team holds implicitly. A senior reviewer who has been with your company for two years can make correct judgments on ambiguous cases because they have internalized hundreds of edge cases and learned how the product team thinks about trade-offs. A vendor's reviewer on day one has none of that context. If you hand them a rubric and expect them to perform at the same level, you will be disappointed.

Knowledge transfer requires deliberate structure. Start by documenting everything your in-house team knows implicitly. What are the edge cases that come up weekly? What are the contextual factors that change a decision from approve to flag? What are the examples of outputs that are technically correct but contextually wrong? Write all of it down, not as abstract principles, but as concrete annotated examples. A good transfer document has 100 examples, each with a decision and a two-sentence explanation of why.

Run a shadowing phase where vendor reviewers work alongside in-house reviewers for two weeks. They review the same cases. They compare decisions. When they disagree, the in-house reviewer explains why. This is expensive — your in-house team is spending half their time teaching instead of reviewing — but it is the only way to transfer judgment that is not in the rubric. After shadowing, run a calibration phase where vendor reviewers work independently but a sample of their decisions is audited daily by the in-house team. Catch mistakes early, explain corrections, and retrain immediately.

Budget three months to reach quality parity. The first month is training and calibration. The second month is close oversight with frequent corrections. The third month is normal operations with weekly audits. If you are not willing to invest three months, do not outsource. A vendor who claims they can deliver quality parity in two weeks is either lying or working on a task so simple that you are overpaying for labor.

## Quality Monitoring for Outsourced Work

Once the vendor is operational, your quality monitoring strategy must change. You are no longer managing individual reviewers — you are managing a vendor relationship. Your monitoring is not about catching individual errors. It is about detecting systematic quality drift, identifying gaps in the vendor's training, and deciding when to escalate concerns.

Sample heavily during the first three months. Review 20 percent of the vendor's output daily. Look for patterns: Are certain reviewers consistently less accurate than others? Are certain task types seeing higher error rates? Is inter-rater agreement dropping over time? Daily sampling lets you catch problems early, before they compound into large-scale quality degradation.

After three months, reduce sampling to 5 to 10 percent, but stratify intelligently. Sample more from low-confidence cases, from newly onboarded reviewers, and from any category where you recently updated the rubric. Rotate which cases you sample — do not always sample from the same slice of work, or you will miss errors in the slices you are ignoring.

Run monthly calibration sessions with the vendor. Send them 50 test cases with known correct answers. Have their reviewers label them independently. Compare results. Identify reviewers whose accuracy is below threshold and require retraining. Use calibration to catch drift — if the vendor's accuracy was 94 percent last month and 89 percent this month, something changed. Investigate whether it is a training issue, a rubric issue, or a volume issue.

Track escalation rates as a quality signal. If the vendor is escalating 15 percent of cases, they are appropriately cautious. If they are escalating 3 percent, they are likely making judgment calls they should not be making. If they are escalating 40 percent, your rubric is incomplete or the task is harder than expected. Escalation rate is a proxy for how much ambiguity the vendor is encountering, and it tells you whether the task is actually outsourceable.

## Hybrid Models That Preserve Expertise

The most effective approach is often hybrid: keep a small in-house team for the work that requires deep context, and outsource the mechanical work to a vendor. The in-house team handles edge cases, rubric updates, calibration, and quality audits. The vendor handles volume.

A healthcare AI company runs this model successfully. They have five in-house reviewers who are former clinical professionals — nurses, medical coders, pharmacists. These reviewers handle all cases where the AI's output might have patient safety implications: drug interaction warnings, diagnosis suggestions, treatment plan modifications. They also own rubric design, calibration, and quality oversight. The vendor handles the remaining 80 percent of volume: routine documentation checks, coding accuracy for non-critical cases, and first-pass review of low-risk outputs. The in-house team reviews 10 percent of the vendor's work weekly and runs monthly calibration sessions.

This model scales. The vendor can grow from 20 reviewers to 200 without adding in-house headcount. But it preserves quality because the high-stakes decisions and the institutional knowledge stay in-house. The in-house team is small, but they are the quality anchor. The vendor delivers volume, not judgment.

Another effective hybrid model is tiered review. The vendor does first-pass review on all cases. Cases that pass first-pass auto-approve or go directly to users. Cases that fail first-pass escalate to the in-house team for adjudication. This works if the first-pass rubric is conservative — it is okay for the vendor to over-flag, because the in-house team will clear the false positives. It does not work if the vendor is expected to make nuanced accept-or-reject decisions, because you will get silent errors.

The wrong hybrid model is outsourcing everything and keeping one in-house person as a liaison. That person cannot do quality oversight, rubric updates, and vendor management simultaneously. They become a bottleneck, and quality suffers because no one is watching closely enough. If you are going to outsource 90 percent of the work, you need at least 3 to 5 in-house people to maintain quality oversight. Anything less is gambling with silent degradation.

## When to Bring Work Back In-House

Sometimes outsourcing fails, and the right move is to bring the work back in-house. The signal is not that quality is low — quality can be improved with training. The signal is that the vendor cannot adapt to the pace of change your product requires. If your rubric is evolving weekly, if your edge cases are shifting as user behavior changes, if your product team is iterating rapidly and the review criteria need to keep up, a vendor will always lag. They need time to retrain, time to update processes, time to get approvals. That lag creates a persistent quality gap.

A fintech company outsourced fraud review to a vendor in early 2025. Six months later, they brought it back in-house. The vendor's quality was fine, but fraud patterns were changing every two weeks. New attack vectors emerged, and the in-house team could spot them and update detection rules within days. The vendor needed two weeks to incorporate new rules into their workflow. By the time the vendor was trained on a new fraud pattern, attackers had moved to the next one. The lag made the vendor ineffective. The company rebuilt an in-house team of 12 reviewers, accepted the higher cost, and regained the agility to respond to threats in real time.

Bringing work back in-house is expensive, but it is cheaper than shipping poor quality for months while waiting for a vendor to catch up. The decision is straightforward: if the cost of quality lag exceeds the cost of hiring, bring it in-house.
