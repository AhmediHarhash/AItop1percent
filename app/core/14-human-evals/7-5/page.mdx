# 7.5 — Do-Not-Show Redaction and Secure Viewing Modes

Most organizations assume that reviewers must see everything to evaluate it properly. This is false and dangerous. A reviewer does not need to see child sexual abuse material to confirm that the AI system correctly blocked it. A reviewer does not need to watch a graphic execution video to verify that the content moderation pipeline flagged it accurately. A reviewer does not need to read the full text of a harassment message to assess whether the tone classifier scored it correctly. The mistake is conflating evaluation with exposure. You can build systems that let reviewers confirm system behavior without forcing them to consume the most harmful content in your queue.

The teams that get this wrong expose reviewers to material that should never reach human eyes, justifying it as necessary for quality assurance. The teams that get it right treat certain content categories as do-not-show by default, using redaction layers, metadata-only views, and secure viewing protocols that require explicit justification and audit trails. The difference is not philosophical. It shows up in reviewer retention, psychological safety incidents, and the operational cost of managing a review workforce that has been traumatized by preventable exposure.

This is not about hiding information from reviewers. It is about designing interfaces that separate the decision to be made from the content itself whenever possible, and when full content access is required, making that access deliberate, justified, and logged.

## The Do-Not-Show List

Every organization handling user-generated content, AI outputs, or moderated interactions needs a formal list of content categories that are never shown to standard reviewers without explicit protocol. This list is not a suggestion. It is a policy enforced at the interface level. Common categories include child sexual abuse material, graphic depictions of extreme violence including torture and executions, content depicting active self-harm or suicide, content created to incite imminent violence, and certain forms of non-consensual intimate imagery.

The defining characteristic of do-not-show content is that viewing it provides no additional evaluation value beyond what metadata and system flags already convey. If your AI system flagged an image as containing CSAM with a confidence score of 0.98, a human reviewer does not improve that decision by viewing the image. If your violence classifier marked a video as depicting an execution, the reviewer gains nothing by watching it. The evaluation task is confirming that the system behaved correctly given the flag, not re-evaluating the content from scratch.

Organizations often resist creating this list because they worry about edge cases or false positives. The worry is backwards. The cost of exposing one hundred reviewers to legitimate harmful content far exceeds the cost of building an escalation path for the rare ambiguous case. You protect reviewers by default and create narrow exceptions with oversight, not the other way around.

The list must be maintained jointly by Trust and Safety, Legal, and the team managing reviewer operations. It evolves as new harm types emerge and as legal obligations shift. In 2026, most platforms include synthetic CSAM, AI-generated deepfake abuse content, and certain terrorism recruitment materials on their do-not-show lists even though these did not exist as formal categories five years earlier.

## Metadata-Only Evaluation Interfaces

When content is marked do-not-show, the reviewer sees metadata instead of the content itself. This includes the content type, the system flags that triggered moderation, confidence scores, timestamp, user account information if relevant, and the decision the system made. The reviewer's task is validating that the system followed policy correctly given the flags, not re-making the decision from the content.

A metadata-only interface for a flagged image might show that the item is an image, it was uploaded at a specific timestamp, the CSAM classifier returned a score of 0.97, the system automatically removed it and reported it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the user account was suspended. The reviewer confirms that this sequence matches policy. If the confidence score had been 0.62 instead of 0.97, the reviewer confirms that the system escalated it to a specialized team rather than auto-actioning. The evaluation is about system behavior, not content judgment.

This works because most content moderation and AI safety decisions are rule-based once the classification is made. If the classifier says CSAM with high confidence, the action is deterministic. If the violence classifier says graphic torture with high confidence, the action is deterministic. The uncertainty is in the classification itself, and that uncertainty is reflected in the confidence score. Reviewers evaluate whether the system applied the right rule for the score it produced.

Metadata-only evaluation is not appropriate for all content categories. Ambiguous cases, borderline policy violations, and content where context significantly affects the decision often require full content review. The point is not to eliminate human judgment but to reserve it for cases where it is actually needed and to protect reviewers from exposure that serves no evaluation purpose.

## Redaction and Blur Modes

For content that sits between clearly do-not-show and safe-to-view, many systems use redaction and blur modes that obscure the most harmful elements while preserving enough context for evaluation. A heavily blurred image can still convey composition, setting, and whether people are present without showing faces or graphic details. A text transcript with automatic redaction can replace slurs, threats, and identifying information with placeholders while preserving tone, structure, and intent.

Blur modes are most effective for visual content where the harmful element is localized. An image containing nudity in a non-sexual context might be blurred by default, with the reviewer able to confirm policy compliance from the blurred version in most cases. A video containing a brief moment of violence might play with heavy blur over the violent frames, allowing the reviewer to assess the overall context without watching the graphic moment.

Redaction works best for text when the harmful element is specific words or phrases rather than the overall message. A harassment message can have slurs replaced with the word "slur-redacted" while keeping the sentence structure intact. The reviewer can assess whether the message constitutes harassment based on pattern, repetition, and targeting behavior without reading the actual slurs. This reduces psychological load without eliminating evaluative capability.

Both techniques have limits. Over-blurred images lose context. Over-redacted text loses meaning. The calibration is finding the minimum exposure level that still allows accurate evaluation. This is not a one-time decision. It evolves as you learn which content categories reviewers can assess from partial information and which require fuller visibility.

## Click-to-Reveal with Justification

Some content requires full visibility for accurate evaluation but should not be shown by default. For these cases, the interface presents redacted or metadata-only views initially, and the reviewer must take a deliberate action to reveal the full content. This action is logged, and in some implementations, it requires the reviewer to enter a justification code or select a reason from a list.

Click-to-reveal creates friction by design. The friction is not bureaucratic. It is protective. It gives the reviewer a moment to prepare, to confirm that viewing the full content is necessary for the task, and to make a conscious choice rather than reflexively clicking through. It also creates an audit trail that lets the organization monitor whether reviewers are revealing content appropriately or habitually clicking through without need.

Justification codes might include options like "confidence score ambiguous, need visual confirmation," "policy violation unclear from metadata," "user appeal requires full review," or "escalation decision requires context." The codes do not require essay-length explanations. They require the reviewer to articulate internally why viewing the content is necessary. That moment of articulation is often enough to prevent unnecessary exposure.

Click-to-reveal is not appropriate for low-severity content or high-volume workflows where every item requires human judgment. It is designed for cases where most items can be evaluated from metadata or redacted views, and only a subset require full exposure. If eighty percent of reviewers are clicking reveal on ninety percent of items, the system has failed. The goal is that reveal actions are rare, deliberate, and justified.

## Secure Viewing for Specialized Reviewers

Some content is so severe that even with click-to-reveal protocols, it should only be accessed by a specialized subset of reviewers who have been trained, consented explicitly, and are monitored closely for psychological impact. This includes content on the do-not-show list when legal obligations or exceptional circumstances require human review, such as confirming a high-stakes false positive or preparing evidence for law enforcement.

Secure viewing takes place in controlled environments. The reviewer may work in a designated physical space with restricted access, use a workstation that does not allow screenshots or recording, and have their session monitored by a supervisor. The content is not stored locally on the reviewer's machine. It streams from a secure server and is not cached. Access is logged with timestamps, session duration, and the specific items viewed.

Organizations often limit secure viewing to reviewers who work a reduced schedule, such as no more than four hours per day with mandatory breaks, and who have access to immediate psychological support. These reviewers are rotated out of the role after a defined period, often three to six months, regardless of performance. The role is understood to have a shelf life. No one should be reviewing the most extreme content for years on end, no matter how experienced or resilient they believe themselves to be.

Secure viewing is expensive and operationally complex, which is why it should be reserved for truly exceptional cases. If your organization is routing hundreds or thousands of items per week into secure viewing, you have either miscalibrated your do-not-show list or failed to automate decisions that should not require human review at all.

## Audit Trails and Access Accountability

Every time a reviewer accesses content beyond the default redaction or metadata view, the system logs it. The log includes the reviewer's ID, the item ID, the timestamp, the reason code if justification was required, and the duration of access. These logs serve three purposes: operational oversight, psychological safety monitoring, and legal compliance.

Operational oversight means supervisors can review access patterns to ensure click-to-reveal is being used appropriately. If a reviewer is consistently revealing content in categories where most peers do not, that triggers a conversation. Either the reviewer is over-exposing themselves unnecessarily, or they are encountering ambiguous cases that suggest the redaction protocol needs refinement. Both outcomes are valuable to know.

Psychological safety monitoring means the organization can track cumulative exposure over time. A reviewer who has accessed severe content five times in one week and fifty times in one month is at higher risk than a reviewer who accessed it twice in three months. Cumulative exposure matters more than single incidents. The audit trail allows the organization to intervene before a reviewer reaches burnout or develops trauma symptoms.

Legal compliance in certain jurisdictions requires that access to illegal content, even for review purposes, is logged and justified. Law enforcement or regulatory audits may require the organization to demonstrate that access was limited, purposeful, and appropriately controlled. Audit trails are not surveillance of reviewers. They are documentation that the organization took its duty of care seriously.

The logs must be stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel. Reviewers should be informed that access is logged and why. Transparency about the audit trail reduces the perception that the organization is surveilling reviewers for punitive reasons and increases trust that the organization is monitoring for their protection.

## Progressive Disclosure for Context-Heavy Content

Some content cannot be evaluated from metadata alone but does not require immediate full exposure. Progressive disclosure interfaces reveal information in stages, allowing the reviewer to stop at the minimum level needed for their decision. The first stage might show metadata and redacted text. The second stage might show full text with images blurred. The third stage might reveal images at low resolution. The fourth stage shows everything.

The reviewer advances through stages only as needed. If they can make a confident policy determination at stage two, they never reach stage three or four. This reduces unnecessary exposure while preserving the ability to access full context when required. Progressive disclosure is particularly useful for content that contains both benign and harmful elements, such as a long conversation thread where only one message violates policy.

The interface design must make it clear what each stage reveals and allow the reviewer to move forward or backward through stages. The reviewer should never feel trapped in a high-exposure view when they have already made their decision. The system should also remember where reviewers typically stop for different content types and optimize the default staging accordingly.

Progressive disclosure does not work for all workflows. High-speed, high-volume queues where reviewers process hundreds of items per hour cannot accommodate multi-stage decisions without sacrificing throughput. It is most appropriate for complex cases, appeals, and escalations where speed is less critical than accuracy and reviewer safety.

## The Escalation Path for Ambiguous Secure Content

When a reviewer encounters content that requires secure viewing but they are not authorized or trained for that level, the item must escalate immediately to a specialized team. The reviewer does not make the call on whether to reveal. The system makes the call based on content flags, and if revelation requires secure viewing, the reviewer sees only a message stating that the item has been escalated and is not available for standard review.

This removes decision fatigue and protects reviewers from accidentally exposing themselves to content they are not prepared for. It also ensures that severe content is only handled by reviewers who have the training, consent, and support infrastructure to manage it safely. The escalation is automatic, not discretionary.

The specialized team that receives the escalation follows all secure viewing protocols. They document their decision, confirm that the escalation was appropriate, and feed that confirmation back into the routing system so future similar items are handled correctly. If escalations are frequent, that signals a problem with the classification system or the do-not-show threshold. The goal is that secure viewing escalations are rare.

## Balancing Protection with Evaluative Capability

The objection to redaction and secure viewing protocols is always the same: if reviewers cannot see the content, how can they evaluate it accurately? The question assumes that evaluation requires full exposure. In reality, evaluation requires only enough information to confirm the system made the correct decision according to policy. For most flagged content, that information exists in metadata, confidence scores, and classification labels.

The test is not whether reviewers can see everything. The test is whether the review system catches errors and policy violations at a rate that meets your quality bar. If metadata-only evaluation produces the same error detection rate as full content review, you choose metadata-only because it protects reviewers at no cost to quality. If redacted views reduce error detection by two percent but prevent fifty reviewers from experiencing trauma, that is often the right trade-off.

Organizations measure this by running parallel reviews: a sample of content reviewed both with and without redaction, comparing agreement rates, accuracy, and decision confidence. The data guides calibration. You tighten redaction where it does not affect outcomes and loosen it where accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds.

The principle is that reviewer protection is not separate from operational effectiveness. It is a component of operational effectiveness. A workforce that burns out or suffers trauma performs worse over time, makes more errors, and costs more to replace. Protecting reviewers protects the quality of the system they are evaluating.

Next, we examine escalation protocols when content crosses from review into legal, Trust and Safety, or incident response territory.
