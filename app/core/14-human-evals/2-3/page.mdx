# 2.3 — Priority Systems: When Everything Is Urgent, Nothing Is

Most teams believe priority is simple: critical, high, medium, low. Then week three arrives. Product calls an item critical because a VIP user is waiting. Engineering calls an item critical because it blocks a deployment. Legal calls an item critical because it might violate a regulation. Trust and Safety calls an item critical because it might represent harm. Everyone has a reason their item should jump the queue. Within six weeks, 60 percent of items are marked critical and the priority system has collapsed into meaningless noise. Reviewers stop trusting priority flags. They pick items based on gut feel, recency, or which stakeholder yells loudest. The queue becomes a negotiation, not a system.

Priority inflation is the most common and most destructive failure mode in review systems. It happens because stakeholders optimize locally — every team wants their work done first — and because the system provides no forcing function to prevent abuse. If marking an item critical moves it to the front of the queue with no cost and no oversight, every rational actor will mark everything critical. The solution is not asking people to be more reasonable. The solution is designing a priority system that resists inflation, enforces trade-offs, and makes abuse visible.

## Priority Tier Design: How Many Levels and What Each Means

The number of priority tiers determines how precisely you can differentiate urgency, but more tiers do not mean better differentiation. A five-tier system — critical, high, medium, low, deferred — sounds more precise than a three-tier system, but if stakeholders do not understand the boundaries between tiers, they will all default to marking everything high or critical. The optimal number of tiers is the number your team can define with crisp, enforceable criteria and your stakeholders can apply consistently without gaming.

Most teams succeed with three or four tiers. Three tiers work when the distinctions are obvious: critical means legal or safety risk, high means user-facing impact, medium means everything else. Four tiers add deferred as a holding area for items that are technically valid but not worth reviewing until capacity allows. Five or more tiers usually fail because the boundaries blur and stakeholders cannot remember which tier applies to their situation.

Each tier needs a definition that stakeholders cannot reinterpret. Critical cannot mean important to me. Critical must mean something objective — active user harm, regulatory violation, legal liability, system outage. High cannot mean I want this reviewed soon. High must mean something measurable — affects production users, blocks a scheduled launch, contractual SLA. Medium is the default — no immediate user impact, no legal risk, no deadline. If your tier definitions are subjective or aspirational, stakeholders will interpret them in their favor every time.

Tier definitions must include examples and counterexamples. A legal policy violation is critical. A user complaint about tone is not critical even if the user is a VIP. A bug that breaks checkout for all users is critical. A bug that breaks a secondary feature for one user is high. A feature request that improves user experience is medium even if the requester is an executive. Concrete examples reduce ambiguity. Counterexamples catch the edge cases where stakeholders try to stretch definitions.

Tier definitions should be enforced at item creation, not applied retroactively. If Product tries to create an item and marks it critical, the creation form should require a reason field that maps to one of the allowed critical criteria. If the reason is not user harm, regulatory violation, or system outage, the system should either reject the critical marking or escalate to a supervisor who approves or downgrades it. Enforcing priority at creation prevents inflation before items enter the queue. Allowing arbitrary priority at creation and fixing it later means reviewers see inflated priorities until someone audits the queue.

Some teams implement quota-based priority enforcement: each stakeholder team gets a budget of critical-priority items per week. If Product has already used five critical slots this week, they cannot mark another item critical until next week unless they un-mark an existing one. This forces stakeholders to prioritize within their own backlog instead of marking everything critical and letting reviewers sort it out. Quota enforcement works if leadership supports it. It fails if executives can override quotas, because then quota becomes a gate that only applies to low-status teams.

## Dynamic Priority: Aging Items and SLA Proximity

Static priority — assigned once at creation and never changed — works poorly for long queues. An item marked medium may sit unreviewed for days if critical and high items keep arriving. At some point, the medium item has aged long enough that it should escalate in priority. Dynamic priority increases an item's priority as it ages, ensuring that no item starves indefinitely even if it started with low priority.

The simplest dynamic priority model is age-based escalation: after an item sits in pending state for a threshold duration, its priority increases by one tier. A medium item that sits unreviewed for 24 hours becomes high. A high item that sits unreviewed for six hours becomes critical. This prevents queue starvation and ensures every item eventually gets reviewed. Age thresholds should vary by initial priority — critical items should escalate faster than medium items because they already represent higher urgency.

A more sophisticated model is SLA proximity-based priority: each item has a review SLA based on its initial priority, and as the SLA deadline approaches, the item's effective priority increases. An item with a 12-hour SLA that has been pending for ten hours is more urgent than an item with a 12-hour SLA that has been pending for two hours, even if both started at the same priority. SLA-based priority ensures that items approaching their deadlines surface first, reducing SLA breach risk.

SLA-based priority requires careful tuning. If SLA windows are too short, every item escalates to critical before reviewers can respond, recreating priority inflation. If SLA windows are too long, items will breach SLAs before dynamic priority moves them to the front of the queue. SLA windows should be calibrated to your team's capacity: if your team can review 100 items per day, and 120 items arrive per day, no SLA window will prevent breaches. The solution is throttling upstream item creation or expanding reviewer capacity, not shortening SLAs.

Dynamic priority interacts poorly with static priority if both use the same tier labels. If an item starts as medium and dynamically escalates to critical, it may appear in the critical queue alongside items that started as critical. Reviewers cannot distinguish between a legitimately critical item and a medium item that aged into critical status. Some teams solve this with split priority labels: static priority uses tier names, dynamic priority uses age or SLA-breach flags that display separately. A reviewer sees an item marked medium with a red SLA-breach warning and knows to treat it as urgent even though its base priority is medium.

Dynamic priority creates incentive problems if stakeholders learn to game it. If Product knows that medium items escalate to high after 24 hours, they may intentionally mark items medium and wait for automatic escalation instead of justifying a high priority upfront. This delays review and undermines the priority system. Combat gaming by making escalation visible in audit logs — if a stakeholder repeatedly creates medium items that escalate to high, that pattern is visible and leadership can address it.

## Priority Inheritance: Escalations and Related Items

When an item escalates, what priority should the escalated item carry? If a medium item escalates from a junior reviewer to a senior specialist, should the escalated item stay medium or inherit higher priority because it is now blocking the original item? If an item relates to another item — a follow-up review, a duplicate report, a multi-part decision — should related items inherit the highest priority among them?

Priority inheritance rules must be explicit. The most common rule is escalated items inherit the original priority plus an escalation bonus. A medium item that escalates becomes high in the specialist queue because the escalation itself signals complexity or uncertainty. This ensures escalated items do not sit at the bottom of the specialist queue while the original reviewer waits. The escalation bonus should be capped — a low item that escalates does not become critical, it becomes medium.

Related items should inherit the highest priority among the group if they must be reviewed together. If a critical item has three related items marked medium, and the reviewer cannot complete the critical item without reviewing the related items, the related items should display with critical priority in the reviewer's view. This prevents the reviewer from being blocked by related items buried at the bottom of their queue. Priority inheritance for related items should propagate: if reviewing item A requires reviewing item B, and reviewing item B requires reviewing item C, then item C inherits priority from item A.

Priority inheritance should not propagate upstream indefinitely. If an escalated item escalates again to a third-tier specialist, the priority should not keep increasing. Set a ceiling: items cannot exceed critical priority regardless of how many escalations occur. Without a ceiling, you will create super-critical priorities that break your tier system.

Priority inheritance creates complexity in audit trails. If an item started as medium, escalated to high, then related items inherited high, and one related item re-escalated to critical, tracing why an item has critical priority requires walking the full inheritance chain. Your queue system must log priority changes with reasons — escalation, age-based escalation, SLA proximity, inheritance from item X. Without detailed logging, reviewers and stakeholders will distrust the priority they see because it does not match the priority at creation.

## The Executive Override Problem

Every priority system eventually faces executive override: a senior leader demands that their item be reviewed immediately, regardless of current priority rules. Executive override is not inherently wrong — sometimes executives have context that justifies urgency — but unconstrained override destroys priority systems. If any executive can arbitrarily mark any item critical, your priority tiers are theater.

The least destructive way to handle executive override is making it visible and rate-limited. Executives can override priority, but every override is logged with their name, timestamp, and reason. Overrides appear in a weekly report that leadership reviews. Overrides count against a quota — each executive gets two priority overrides per month. This makes override a deliberate, costly action rather than a casual one. Executives will reserve overrides for situations that genuinely justify urgency, because using an override for a marginal case burns their quota for a future critical need.

Some teams require executive overrides to bump an existing item down in priority to make room. If an executive marks a new item critical, they must identify an existing critical item to downgrade to high. This enforces a zero-sum trade-off: gaining priority for one item means losing priority for another. The executive must justify why their item is more important than the existing critical item. This prevents priority inflation because the total number of critical items stays constant.

Other teams implement override expiration: an executive can override priority for a single item, but the override lasts only 24 hours. If the item is not reviewed within 24 hours, it reverts to its original priority. This prevents long-term distortion of the queue from one-time urgency. If the executive's urgency was legitimate, the item gets reviewed in 24 hours. If the urgency was exaggerated, the item reverts to its proper place after the override window expires.

The hardest case is when executives override priority frequently and leadership does not push back. If the CEO marks five items critical per day and no one questions it, your priority system is effectively controlled by one person and your formal tiers are irrelevant. The only solution is leadership alignment on priority discipline — either leadership agrees that executive override is limited and monitored, or they admit that the priority system does not apply to executives and you design a separate fast-lane queue for executive requests. The latter is politically easier but operationally harder because it splits your reviewer capacity and creates a two-tier system.

## Strict vs Weighted Priority: How Items Compete for Attention

Strict priority means critical items are always reviewed before high items, high items are always reviewed before medium items, and medium items are reviewed only when no higher-priority items are pending. Weighted priority means priority influences review order but does not absolutely determine it — a medium item with a very short handle time might be reviewed before a high item with a long handle time if it clears the queue faster.

Strict priority is simpler to implement and easier to explain. Reviewers always pick the highest-priority item available. The queue sorts by priority first, then by age within priority. Strict priority guarantees that critical items never wait behind medium items. The downside is strict priority can starve low-priority items indefinitely if high-priority items keep arriving. A medium item created on Monday may still be pending on Friday if critical and high items arrive continuously.

Weighted priority assigns a score to each item based on priority, age, reviewer affinity, and SLA proximity. Items sort by score, not by tier. A medium item with very old age and high affinity may score higher than a high item that just arrived with no affinity. Weighted priority reduces starvation risk and allows short-duration items to clear quickly even if they are not top priority. The downside is weighted priority is harder to explain and harder to tune. If stakeholders do not understand how scoring works, they will distrust the system when they see a medium item reviewed before a high item.

Most teams start with strict priority because it is predictable and easy to defend. If critical means critical, then critical items should always go first. Teams evolve toward weighted priority when starvation becomes a problem or when clearing easy items is more efficient than always grinding on hard items. Weighted priority requires more sophisticated queue management and more stakeholder education, but it handles real-world complexity better than strict priority.

## Starvation Prevention for Low-Priority Items

Starvation happens when low-priority items sit unreviewed indefinitely because higher-priority items keep arriving. An item marked low at creation may still be pending three weeks later if the queue is always backlogged with medium and high items. Starvation is bad for morale, bad for completeness, and creates hidden debt — eventually someone will ask why an item from three weeks ago was never reviewed, and the answer "because it was low priority" will not satisfy them.

The simplest starvation prevention is age-based escalation: low items that age beyond a threshold automatically escalate to medium. This ensures every item gets reviewed eventually. The threshold for low-priority escalation should be long enough that it does not inflate the queue with artificially promoted items, but short enough that items do not linger for months. Seven days is common. If a low item has been pending for seven days, it escalates to medium, ensuring it will get reviewed within the next few days.

Some teams implement guaranteed review windows: low-priority items are guaranteed review within 30 days, medium within seven days, high within 24 hours, critical within two hours. If an item is about to exceed its guaranteed window, it automatically escalates in priority to meet the guarantee. Guaranteed windows prevent starvation and set stakeholder expectations — even low-priority items have a defined maximum wait time.

Another approach is periodic low-priority sprints: one day per week, reviewers only work on low-priority items. This clears the backlog of aged items and ensures that low priority does not mean never reviewed. The downside is this delays high-priority items created during the sprint. Some teams compromise by assigning a percentage of reviewer capacity to low-priority items — 20 percent of each reviewer's daily capacity goes to low items, 80 percent goes to higher priorities. This ensures continuous progress on low items without blocking high items.

Starvation prevention should not dilute the meaning of priority. If low items escalate to medium after three days, and medium items escalate to high after two days, then every item becomes high within a week and your priority system has collapsed. Escalation thresholds must be long enough that they act as a safety net, not as the primary review path.

## When Priority Systems Collapse: Symptoms and Recovery

A collapsed priority system has clear symptoms. More than 40 percent of items are marked critical or high. Escalation happens frequently not because items are complex but because stakeholders know escalation jumps the queue. Reviewers ignore priority tags and pick items based on personal preference or stakeholder pressure. The queue backlog grows faster than review throughput. SLA breaches become routine. Stakeholders stop trusting review timelines and escalate directly to leadership.

Recovery requires resetting priorities, retraining stakeholders, and enforcing rules that prevent re-collapse. Resetting priorities means auditing the current queue and re-marking every item according to the correct priority definitions. Items marked critical that do not meet critical criteria get downgraded to high or medium. This is politically painful but necessary. If you do not reset, the queue stays distorted forever and stakeholders see no reason to follow the new rules.

Retraining stakeholders means explaining the new priority definitions, showing examples, and demonstrating that the system enforces rules. Stakeholder training should include data: show them the percentage of items marked critical before the reset, show them the queue backlog, show them the SLA breach rate. Then show them the new rules, the enforcement mechanisms — quotas, override limits, approval gates — and the expected outcomes. Stakeholders will only follow the new system if they believe it will work and if they see enforcement happening.

Enforcing rules means rejecting improperly marked items, blocking creation until the requester fixes priority, escalating repeat offenders to leadership, and publishing metrics on who follows the rules and who does not. Enforcement must be consistent. If Product gets away with marking everything critical but Engineering gets their items rejected, Engineering will stop using the system. If executives can override priority without consequence but individual contributors cannot, the system is not fair and people will route around it.

Priority system recovery also requires addressing the root cause: if the queue is always backlogged, priority inflation is a symptom, not the problem. The problem is insufficient reviewer capacity for the item volume. Fixing the priority system without fixing capacity will recreate inflation within weeks. Either increase reviewer capacity, decrease item volume by throttling upstream systems, or tighten review scope so fewer items require human review.

## Why Priority Is the Hardest Part of Queue Architecture

Routing can be technically complex, but routing rules are deterministic and testable. State management can be tricky, but state machines are well-understood engineering patterns. Priority is hard because it is social and political, not just technical. Priority encodes trade-offs between teams, between urgency and importance, between user needs and business needs. Priority systems fail when the technical design does not account for human incentives, organizational power dynamics, and the fact that everyone believes their work is the most important.

The best priority systems are boring. They have clear tiers, objective definitions, enforcement at creation, dynamic escalation to prevent starvation, and visible audit trails that make gaming obvious. They resist inflation not through appeals to reasonableness but through structural rules that make inflation costly. They give executives a legitimate override path that does not undermine the system. They align stakeholder incentives with system health by making priority abuse visible and making proper prioritization rewarded.

Priority is the forcing function that makes your queue usable at scale. Without priority, your queue is first-come-first-served and the only way to get urgent items reviewed quickly is to create them first or yell louder. With priority, your queue becomes a system where urgency is explicit, trade-offs are transparent, and review capacity flows to the items that matter most.

The next architectural decision is how reviewers interact with items once they claim them: the design of the review interface itself, and why that interface determines both review quality and reviewer retention.
