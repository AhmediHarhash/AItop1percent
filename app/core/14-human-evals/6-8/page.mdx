# 6.8 — Corrective Action Protocols

In November 2024, a content moderation platform discovered through routine quality sampling that one of their senior reviewers had been misclassifying severe policy violations for six weeks. The reviewer's accuracy had dropped from 94 percent to 71 percent. The team lead noticed the decline but delayed action, hoping it was temporary. By the time leadership intervened, over 2,800 cases had been incorrectly reviewed, requiring a full re-review cycle that cost the company $48,000 in rework and delayed content decisions for enterprise clients. The damage wasn't just operational. The delay in addressing the performance issue created a perception among other reviewers that quality standards were optional, and overall team accuracy dropped by 5 percent across the board during the same period.

The failure wasn't that the problem occurred. Reviewer performance degrades for dozens of legitimate reasons—personal stress, guideline confusion, burnout, health issues. The failure was the absence of a clear, consistent protocol for identifying performance issues and taking corrective action. Without a documented process, the team lead didn't know when coaching was appropriate versus formal warnings, what documentation was required, or when to escalate to management. The result was inaction, damage amplification, and eventual panic-driven termination that exposed the company to legal risk.

Corrective action protocols define how you respond when a reviewer's performance falls below acceptable thresholds. These protocols must balance three competing priorities: protecting quality standards, treating reviewers fairly and compassionately, and minimizing legal and operational risk. The protocol must be clear enough that any team lead can follow it consistently, detailed enough that it provides due process to reviewers, and humane enough that it recognizes reviewers as people, not machines.

## The Progressive Discipline Framework

Progressive discipline is the industry-standard approach to performance management. It escalates consequences in stages, giving reviewers multiple opportunities to improve before facing termination. The framework has four stages: informal coaching, formal coaching with documentation, written warning with performance improvement plan, and removal from the role.

Informal coaching is the first response to any performance dip. The team lead meets with the reviewer one-on-one, reviews the specific cases where quality fell short, explains what should have happened, and checks for understanding. This conversation is not documented in the reviewer's permanent record. It's a teaching moment. The team lead asks open-ended questions to understand why the errors occurred. Was the guideline unclear? Was the reviewer rushing due to volume pressure? Is there a personal issue affecting focus? The goal is diagnosis and support, not punishment.

Informal coaching resolves the majority of performance issues. Most reviewers who receive specific, timely feedback correct their errors and return to baseline performance within days. Informal coaching happens frequently—several times per quarter for most reviewers—and carries no stigma. It's part of the normal feedback loop.

Formal coaching with documentation is the second stage. If a reviewer's performance does not improve after informal coaching, or if the same error pattern repeats within 30 days, the team lead schedules a formal coaching session. This session is documented. The team lead prepares a written summary of the performance issue, including specific case examples, accuracy metrics, and the gap between current performance and the required standard. The reviewer receives a copy of this summary, signs an acknowledgment that they understand the issue, and commits to a specific corrective action plan with a defined timeline, typically two to four weeks.

The documentation serves two purposes. First, it creates a clear record that the reviewer was informed of the performance gap and given an opportunity to improve. Second, it establishes a baseline for evaluating whether improvement occurred. If the reviewer's accuracy returns to acceptable levels during the follow-up period, the formal coaching closes successfully and becomes part of their performance history but not a permanent mark against them.

Written warning with performance improvement plan is the third stage. If performance does not improve after formal coaching, or if a serious quality failure occurs—such as approving content that violates legal requirements or company policy—leadership issues a written warning. This is a formal HR action. The warning document specifies the performance deficiency, the required standard, the consequences of continued underperformance, and a structured performance improvement plan with weekly check-ins, explicit success criteria, and a final review date, typically 30 to 60 days out.

The performance improvement plan is not a formality. It must be a genuine opportunity for the reviewer to succeed. That means providing additional support: extra training, reduced case volume to allow focus on quality over speed, access to a mentor or experienced peer, and frequent feedback. If the organization issues a performance improvement plan but does not provide the resources for the reviewer to succeed, the plan becomes a paper trail for termination rather than a real corrective process. That approach is both unethical and legally risky.

Removal from the role is the final stage. If the reviewer does not meet the success criteria of the performance improvement plan, or if a catastrophic quality failure occurs—such as deliberate policy violations, data breaches, or gross negligence—leadership removes the reviewer from the role. Depending on the organization's structure, this may mean termination, reassignment to a different role, or suspension pending investigation. Removal is not taken lightly. It should only occur after the reviewer has been given clear expectations, adequate support, and multiple opportunities to improve—or in cases where the severity of the failure makes continued employment untenable.

## Documentation Requirements at Each Stage

Every stage of progressive discipline requires specific documentation. Without documentation, the corrective action protocol becomes unenforceable. Managers forget what was said in coaching conversations. Reviewers dispute warnings. Legal counsel cannot defend termination decisions. Documentation is not bureaucracy. It is the foundation of fairness and consistency.

Informal coaching does not require permanent documentation, but team leads should keep brief notes for their own reference. These notes are not part of the official HR record. They might be as simple as a dated entry in a spreadsheet: "Spoke with Alex about guideline interpretation on hate speech cases. Reviewed three examples. Alex acknowledged confusion and asked for clarification on edge cases." These notes help the team lead track whether the same issue recurs and whether it's time to escalate to formal coaching.

Formal coaching requires a written summary shared with the reviewer and stored in the team's quality management system. The summary includes the reviewer's name and ID, the date of the coaching session, a description of the performance issue with specific case IDs and accuracy metrics, the corrective actions agreed upon, the timeline for improvement, and the date of the next review. Both the team lead and the reviewer sign the document. If the reviewer refuses to sign, the team lead notes the refusal in the document and proceeds. Refusal to sign does not invalidate the coaching.

Written warnings and performance improvement plans require HR involvement. The team lead drafts the warning document and the performance improvement plan, but HR reviews both for legal compliance before they are delivered to the reviewer. The warning document must be precise. It specifies the exact performance standard that was violated, the evidence supporting the claim, the previous corrective actions taken, and the consequences of continued underperformance, including potential termination. Vague language like "quality needs to improve" is insufficient. The standard must be measurable: "Your accuracy over the past 30 days is 76 percent. The required standard is 90 percent. You must achieve and maintain 90 percent accuracy for four consecutive weeks to close this performance improvement plan successfully."

Termination requires a complete paper trail. HR will review all prior coaching documentation, warnings, and performance improvement plans to verify that the reviewer was given due process. If any step in the progressive discipline process was skipped or poorly documented, the termination may be challenged successfully in court or arbitration. This is not a theoretical risk. Employment lawsuits are common, and poorly documented terminations are expensive to defend even when the underlying performance issue was legitimate.

## Legal Considerations and Due Process

Employment law varies by jurisdiction, but certain principles apply broadly. Reviewers in most jurisdictions have the right to know what performance is expected of them, to receive timely feedback when performance falls short, to be given a reasonable opportunity to improve, and to be treated consistently with other employees in similar roles.

Consistency is the most legally sensitive element. If one reviewer receives three stages of coaching before termination but another reviewer is terminated after a single formal warning for a similar performance issue, the organization has created a discrimination risk. The terminated reviewer can argue that the inconsistency was based on a protected characteristic—age, gender, race, disability. Even if the claim is baseless, the inconsistency weakens the organization's legal position. Corrective action protocols exist partly to enforce consistency. Every team lead must follow the same process, apply the same standards, and document the same way.

Protected class considerations require additional care. If a reviewer's performance decline is related to a medical condition, disability, or family emergency, employment law may require the organization to provide reasonable accommodations before pursuing termination. A reviewer who discloses a mental health condition that is affecting focus may be entitled to temporary reduced volume, adjusted schedules, or medical leave. A reviewer caring for a sick family member may be entitled to flexible hours under family medical leave laws. These accommodations do not exempt the reviewer from meeting quality standards, but they may extend the timeline for improvement or adjust the support provided during the performance improvement plan.

HR involvement is not optional. Team leads should not issue written warnings or performance improvement plans without HR review. HR's role is to ensure the documentation is legally sound, the process follows company policy, and the proposed corrective actions comply with employment law. HR also provides guidance on when accommodations are required, when termination is premature, and when the organization should consult legal counsel. Skipping HR to "move faster" is a decision that creates legal liability and undermines the corrective action process.

## Balancing Compassion with Quality

Corrective action protocols can feel harsh. Reviewers are people with lives, stresses, and challenges outside of work. Performance issues are often symptoms of broader struggles—financial stress, health problems, family crises. A purely mechanistic approach to discipline—hit the threshold, issue the warning, start the clock—treats reviewers as interchangeable units rather than human beings.

The corrective action process must have room for compassion. That does not mean lowering standards. It means recognizing that a reviewer who has been excellent for two years and suddenly struggles for three weeks deserves a different response than a reviewer who has been marginal since hiring. It means asking "what happened?" before asking "what's the consequence?" It means offering support—access to employee assistance programs, temporary volume reductions, schedule adjustments—alongside accountability.

Compassion is not weakness. It is an investment in retention. Training a new reviewer costs thousands of dollars and takes weeks. If a struggling reviewer can return to high performance with support, the organization saves money and retains institutional knowledge. If the reviewer ultimately cannot meet the standard despite support, the organization has clear evidence that it acted fairly, and other reviewers see that leadership treats people with dignity even in difficult situations. That perception matters for morale and trust.

But compassion cannot override quality. If a reviewer's performance issues are creating risk—legal risk, brand risk, operational risk—the organization must act decisively. A reviewer in a Tier 1 domain who is misclassifying regulated content cannot continue in the role while leadership waits for personal circumstances to improve. The corrective action protocol must be followed, accommodations must be provided where legally required, but if performance does not meet the standard within the defined timeline, removal is the only responsible outcome.

## Training Team Leads to Execute the Protocol

The corrective action protocol is only effective if team leads can execute it consistently. Many team leads are promoted from within the reviewer pool. They were excellent reviewers, but they have no formal training in performance management, difficult conversations, or documentation. Expecting them to navigate progressive discipline without training is setting them up to fail.

Team leads need structured training in three areas: how to recognize when performance has crossed the threshold from normal variation into a corrective action trigger, how to conduct coaching conversations that are firm but supportive, and how to document performance issues in a way that is factual, specific, and legally sound.

Threshold recognition requires understanding both the metrics and the context. If a reviewer's accuracy drops from 95 percent to 92 percent in a single week, that may be normal variation. If it drops from 95 percent to 85 percent over three weeks, that is a pattern requiring informal coaching. If it drops to 75 percent, that is an immediate escalation to formal coaching. Team leads need decision trees that map metric thresholds to corrective action stages so they do not under-react or over-react based on gut feel.

Coaching conversations are uncomfortable. Team leads must deliver critical feedback to peers they may have worked alongside for months or years. Training should include role-playing scenarios where team leads practice delivering coaching messages, handling defensiveness or denial, and staying focused on specific, observable behaviors rather than personality or intent. A well-delivered coaching conversation focuses on the work, not the person. Instead of "you're careless," the team lead says "these three cases were marked approved but they violated guideline section four. Walk me through your reasoning so I can understand what happened."

Documentation training teaches team leads to write factually and avoid inflammatory language. Documentation should never include subjective judgments like "lazy" or "doesn't care." It should state observable facts: "Accuracy for the past 30 days is 78 percent. Required standard is 90 percent. Errors concentrated in hate speech classifications, where the reviewer approved content that guideline section three explicitly prohibits." HR should review sample documentation during training and provide feedback on language, completeness, and legal soundness.

## Tracking Corrective Actions Across the Team

Quality operations leaders need visibility into how many reviewers are in each stage of the corrective action process at any time. If ten percent of the team is on formal coaching plans simultaneously, that signals a systemic problem—unclear guidelines, inadequate training, unrealistic volume targets, or poor hiring. If corrective actions are concentrated in a single team or shift, that signals a team lead issue—inconsistent feedback, poor training, or favoritism.

A corrective action dashboard should show the number of reviewers in each stage of progressive discipline, the average time reviewers spend in each stage before returning to acceptable performance or exiting the role, the success rate of performance improvement plans, and the distribution of corrective actions by team, shift, and task type. This dashboard is not public. It is a leadership tool for identifying patterns and intervening early.

If the success rate of performance improvement plans is below 50 percent, the plans are not working. Either the organization is not providing adequate support, the timeline is too short, or the plans are being used as a formality before termination rather than a genuine corrective tool. Leadership should audit a sample of recent performance improvement plans to diagnose the issue.

If corrective actions are concentrated in one team, leadership should investigate the team lead's approach. Is the team lead providing consistent feedback? Is the team lead issuing corrective actions for issues that other team leads handle through informal coaching? Is the team lead creating a high-stress environment that drives performance down? The corrective action protocol applies to team leads as well. If a team lead is not executing the process correctly, that team lead needs coaching or reassignment.

## When Immediate Removal Is Warranted

Progressive discipline assumes that performance issues are correctable with feedback and support. That assumption does not hold in every case. Some failures are so severe that they warrant immediate removal without prior warnings. These cases are rare, but they must be defined clearly so that team leads and leadership know when to skip the progressive discipline process and act immediately.

Deliberate policy violations are grounds for immediate removal. If a reviewer knowingly approves content they know violates policy—because they disagree with the policy, because they were bribed, because they are trying to sabotage the system—that is not a performance issue. That is misconduct. The reviewer is not confused or undertrained. They are acting in bad faith. Immediate termination is appropriate, and law enforcement may need to be involved if the violation involves illegal content.

Data breaches and confidentiality violations are grounds for immediate removal. If a reviewer shares screenshots of cases on social media, discusses specific cases outside of work in ways that violate confidentiality agreements, or attempts to access cases they are not assigned to, they have violated trust. The corrective action protocol does not apply. The reviewer is removed immediately, and legal reviews the incident for potential liability.

Gross negligence that creates imminent harm is grounds for immediate removal. If a reviewer in a medical AI review system approves a diagnostic recommendation that contradicts clear medical evidence and that approval could lead to patient harm, the reviewer is removed immediately pending investigation. The stakes are too high to allow continued review activity while leadership determines whether the failure was a one-time mistake or a pattern of incompetence.

Harassment, discrimination, or violence are grounds for immediate removal. If a reviewer engages in behavior that creates a hostile work environment, discriminates against colleagues, or threatens violence, the corrective action protocol does not apply. The reviewer is removed immediately, HR investigates, and law enforcement may be involved.

Immediate removal still requires documentation. The organization must document the incident that triggered removal, the evidence supporting the decision, and the rationale for skipping progressive discipline. Without documentation, immediate removal is vulnerable to legal challenge. But the documentation occurs after the removal, not as part of a multi-week process. The priority is protecting the organization, the team, and in some cases the public from continued harm.

## Building Trust Through Fair Enforcement

Reviewers watch how leadership handles performance issues. If corrective actions are applied inconsistently—if some reviewers get away with poor performance while others are held to strict standards—trust erodes. Reviewers disengage. They stop believing that quality matters. They begin to see corrective actions as arbitrary or personal rather than professional.

Fair enforcement requires that the corrective action protocol is applied to everyone: new hires and veterans, full-time employees and contractors, reviewers the team lead likes and reviewers the team lead finds difficult. The standard is the same. The process is the same. The documentation is the same. If a reviewer meets the threshold for formal coaching, formal coaching occurs. If a reviewer meets the threshold for a written warning, a written warning is issued. There are no exceptions based on seniority, personality, or political capital.

Transparency helps build trust. Reviewers should know what the corrective action process is before any performance issue occurs. The process should be documented in the reviewer handbook, explained during onboarding, and referenced regularly in team meetings. Reviewers should know what accuracy threshold triggers informal coaching, what threshold triggers formal coaching, and what happens if performance does not improve. When a corrective action occurs, it should not be a surprise. The reviewer should recognize that they crossed a threshold that was explained to them in advance.

Leadership must also communicate when corrective actions result in removal. The details are confidential, but the fact that the organization holds reviewers accountable is not. If a reviewer is terminated for performance reasons and the rest of the team never hears about it, they may assume the reviewer quit or was moved to a different project. That silence undermines the credibility of the corrective action process. Leadership can communicate in general terms: "We recently exited a reviewer whose performance did not meet standards despite coaching and a performance improvement plan. This demonstrates that the quality thresholds we set are real and enforced." That message reinforces that the organization takes quality seriously without violating the terminated reviewer's confidentiality.

## The Next Layer: Quality Dashboards for Review Operations

Corrective action protocols operate at the individual reviewer level. They handle performance issues one person at a time. But quality operations leaders also need system-level visibility into how the entire review operation is performing across accuracy, agreement, throughput, and service-level adherence. That visibility comes from dashboards designed to surface patterns, identify risks, and guide operational decisions. The dashboard must serve multiple audiences—reviewers who want to see their own performance, team leads who manage day-to-day operations, and executives who need to know whether the review system is meeting business requirements—and each audience needs different information presented in different ways.
