# 3.9 — Accessibility in Review Tooling

Accessible design is not a feature request. It's a legal requirement in most jurisdictions and a moral obligation in all of them. Review tools that aren't accessible exclude qualified reviewers based on disability. They violate WCAG standards, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the European Accessibility Act, and equivalent regulations worldwide. They also produce worse results. A tool that's hard to use for people with disabilities is usually hard to use for everyone. Accessible design is better design. The two are not in conflict.

The most common mistake is treating accessibility as a checklist to complete during QA. Run an automated scanner, fix the obvious issues, call it done. Automated tools catch maybe thirty percent of accessibility problems. The rest require human testing with actual assistive technology—screen readers, voice control, keyboard-only navigation, magnification software. If your review tool hasn't been tested by reviewers who rely on these technologies, it isn't accessible. It just passes a scanner.

## WCAG Compliance as Baseline

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines define three conformance levels: A, AA, and AAA. Level A is the minimum. Level AA is the standard for most legal compliance. Level AAA is the gold standard, difficult to achieve for complex applications but worth striving for. Review tools should target AA compliance at minimum. This isn't optional. It's the legal floor in the EU, UK, Canada, and increasingly the US.

Level AA requirements include sufficient color contrast—4.5 to 1 for normal text, 3 to 1 for large text. Most design systems fail this. Light gray text on white backgrounds looks modern and clean. It's also invisible to people with low vision. Use a contrast checker during design. Fix contrast issues before development. Retrofitting contrast is annoying but straightforward. Retrofitting an entire visual identity because it fails accessibility audits is expensive and embarrassing.

Keyboard navigation must be complete and logical. Every interactive element—buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes, links—must be reachable via keyboard. Tab order must follow visual order. Focus indicators must be visible. This sounds trivial. Most modern web applications fail it. Custom dropdowns and rich text editors break keyboard navigation constantly. If a reviewer can't complete a task using only a keyboard, your tool is non-compliant.

Semantic HTML matters more than most engineers realize. A button that's actually a div with an onclick handler looks the same to sighted users. To a screen reader, it's invisible or announced incorrectly. Use real button elements for buttons, real form inputs for inputs, real links for navigation. Semantic HTML gives assistive technology the structure it needs to interpret the page. Without it, you're asking screen reader users to navigate by guesswork.

## Screen Reader Compatibility

Screen readers convert visual interfaces into speech or Braille. They rely on semantic markup, ARIA labels, and logical document structure. A poorly structured page is confusing to sighted users. To screen reader users, it's unusable. You need to test with actual screen readers—NVDA and JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS and iOS, TalkBack on Android. Browser dev tools don't tell you how your interface sounds. Only actual screen readers do.

ARIA labels are essential for custom controls. A button with an icon but no visible text needs an aria-label describing its function: "Submit review" not "Button." A status indicator that shows a green checkmark needs an aria-live region announcing "Task completed" when it appears. Visual cues are meaningless to screen reader users. You have to provide the equivalent information as text.

Dynamic content is the hardest problem. If the interface updates without a page reload—new tasks load, error messages appear, confirmation dialogs pop up—screen readers won't notice unless you tell them. Use aria-live regions for announcements. Use focus management to move attention to new content. If a modal opens, move focus to the modal. If an error appears, announce it immediately. Silent updates are invisible to screen reader users. They'll submit tasks with errors, miss feedback, and have no idea anything happened.

Overly verbose interfaces are also a problem. A sighted reviewer scans the page in two seconds. A screen reader user hears every element read aloud in sequence. If your interface has thirty elements before the actual task content, the reviewer spends twenty seconds just getting to the work. Reduce clutter. Put the task first. Move navigation, stats, and secondary controls below the primary content. Let screen reader users get to the point.

## Color Blindness and Visual Impairments

Eight percent of men and 0.5 percent of women have some form of color blindness. The most common type, red-green color blindness, makes red and green appear similar. If your interface uses red for errors and green for success with no other distinguishing feature, those reviewers can't tell the difference. Color alone is never sufficient. Always pair color with text, icons, or patterns.

Contrast issues affect everyone with low vision, not just color blindness. Light gray text on white, pastels on pastels, low-opacity overlays—all of these fail for users who can't perceive subtle contrast differences. High-contrast mode is a common accessibility setting. Test your interface in high-contrast mode. If elements disappear or become unreadable, you have a problem.

Visual density is another variable. Some users need large text. Some use magnification software that enlarges sections of the screen. If your interface requires seeing multiple elements simultaneously—task on the left, guidelines on the right, controls at the bottom—magnification breaks it. The user can only see one section at a time. Design for sequential use. Let reviewers zoom text without breaking layout. Use responsive design so that magnified content reflows instead of clipping.

Flashing or flickering content can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. WCAG prohibits flashing more than three times per second. This includes animations, auto-playing videos, and rapid state changes in UI elements. If you use loading spinners, status indicators, or progress bars, ensure they don't flash rapidly. The legal threshold is three flashes per second. The safe design threshold is no flashing at all.

## Motor Impairments and Input Flexibility

Motor impairments range from tremors to paralysis. Reviewers with motor impairments may use voice control, switch devices, eye tracking, or adaptive keyboards. They need large click targets, no reliance on hover states, and no time limits on interactions. A reviewer using a switch device might take thirty seconds to reach a button that a mouse user clicks instantly. If your interface times out or auto-advances, you've excluded them.

Click target size is defined in WCAG: at least 44 by 44 pixels for touch, 24 by 24 pixels for pointer devices. Most web controls are smaller. Checkboxes, radio buttons, and icon-only buttons regularly fail this. Make controls larger or expand the clickable area to include surrounding space. A checkbox with a label should allow clicking the label to toggle the checkbox. This helps everyone but is critical for users with limited motor control.

Drag-and-drop interfaces are inaccessible to many users. Dragging requires precise, sustained motor control. A reviewer who can click but not drag is blocked. Always provide an alternative. Let users select an item, then click a button to move it. Let users reorder lists with up/down arrow buttons. Drag-and-drop can be a nice-to-have for some users. It can never be the only way to complete a task.

Hover-dependent interactions are a disaster for accessibility. Tooltips, dropdown menus, or hidden controls that only appear on hover don't work for touch users, keyboard users, or voice control users. If information is important enough to show on hover, it's important enough to show always or to provide via keyboard-accessible interaction. Hover is a progressive enhancement, not a requirement.

## Cognitive Accessibility

Cognitive disabilities include dyslexia, ADHD, memory impairments, and processing disorders. These users benefit from clear language, consistent layouts, and reduced cognitive load. Many of the principles that make interfaces easier for people with cognitive disabilities also improve usability for everyone.

Plain language is essential. Use short sentences, common words, and active voice. Avoid jargon unless it's necessary and defined. Break long instructions into numbered steps. Use headings to organize content. Cognitive load increases when users have to parse complex sentences, remember multi-step processes, or decode ambiguous instructions. Simplify ruthlessly.

Consistent layouts reduce cognitive burden. If the Submit button is at the bottom right on one task and bottom left on the next, users have to reorient every time. If field labels are above inputs on one form and beside inputs on another, users have to process two different patterns. Consistency isn't boring. It's respectful. It lets users build mental models and focus on the work instead of the interface.

Memory demands should be minimized. Don't require reviewers to remember information from one screen to the next. Show context inline. If a reviewer needs to compare the task to guidelines, show both simultaneously. If they need to reference previous judgments, display them. Forcing users to remember information while navigating between screens is a cognitive accessibility failure and a general usability failure.

Error prevention is more accessible than error recovery. Validate inputs before submission. Provide clear constraints—"Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format"—before the user starts typing. Use dropdown menus instead of free text when options are constrained. If an error occurs, explain what went wrong and how to fix it in plain language. "Invalid input" is not helpful. "Date must be in the format 2026-01-15" is.

## Font Size, Contrast, and Readability

Users must be able to resize text up to 200 percent without breaking the interface. This is a WCAG AA requirement. Most modern browsers support text zoom, but many web applications break when users apply it. Text overflows containers, overlaps other text, or gets clipped. Design with flexible layouts. Test at 200 percent zoom. Fix breakage before launch.

Font choice affects readability more than most designers admit. Decorative fonts, narrow fonts, and ultra-light fonts are hard to read for people with low vision or dyslexia. Use sans-serif fonts for body text. Use medium or regular weight, not thin or light. Use generous line spacing—at least 1.5 times the font size. Use adequate paragraph spacing. Dense text blocks are hostile to everyone, but especially to users with reading disabilities.

Justification and hyphenation reduce readability. Justified text creates uneven word spacing that disrupts reading flow, especially for people with dyslexia. Hyphenation breaks words in unpredictable places, making them harder to parse. Use left-aligned text. Don't justify. Don't hyphenate. These are minor design choices with major accessibility impact.

Background patterns and textures interfere with text readability. A subtle pattern that looks elegant to a sighted user with good vision becomes visual noise for someone with low vision or a processing disorder. Use solid backgrounds for text. If you must use a pattern or image, ensure text has a solid background overlay with sufficient contrast. Readability always wins over aesthetics.

## Why Accessible Design Helps Everyone

Accessible design principles improve usability for all users, not just those with disabilities. High contrast benefits users in bright sunlight. Keyboard navigation benefits power users who hate reaching for a mouse. Large click targets reduce misclicks on trackpads. Clear language reduces errors for non-native speakers and tired reviewers. Accessible design isn't a separate, inferior experience. It's better design.

Curb cuts are the classic example. They were mandated for wheelchair users. Now everyone uses them—parents with strollers, delivery workers with carts, travelers with luggage. The same principle applies to digital interfaces. Features designed for accessibility become features everyone relies on. Keyboard shortcuts, captions, voice control—all of these started as accessibility features and became mainstream.

Testing with real users who rely on assistive technology will teach you more than any guideline document. Hire reviewers with disabilities. Pay them to test your tool and provide feedback. Watch them use screen readers, voice control, magnification software. You'll discover pain points no automated scanner would catch. You'll see where your interface is hostile and where it works. User testing isn't optional for accessibility. It's the only way to know if your tool actually works.

## Legal Requirements and Compliance

The Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508, the European Accessibility Act, and the UK Equality Act all require digital accessibility. Enforcement varies, but the trend is toward stricter compliance. Lawsuits over inaccessible websites and applications are increasing. Settlements and legal fees often exceed the cost of building accessibly from the start. Compliance is cheaper than remediation.

Procurement requirements in government and large enterprises increasingly mandate WCAG AA compliance. If your review tool is sold to government agencies, healthcare organizations, or financial institutions, accessibility compliance is a contractual requirement. Non-compliant tools are excluded from bids. This isn't hypothetical. Accessibility is a market access issue.

Voluntary Product Accessibility Template documents are often required during procurement. A VPAT describes how your product conforms to accessibility standards. If you can't produce one, or if it's full of non-compliant items, you lose the deal. VPATs are tedious to create but necessary for enterprise sales. Start building one before you need it. Retroactive VPATs are painful because they surface all the accessibility debt you've accumulated.

The business case for accessibility is straightforward. Building accessibly from the start costs ten to twenty percent more in development time. Retrofitting an inaccessible tool costs three to five times the original build cost. Losing a procurement deal because your tool isn't compliant costs infinitely more. Accessibility is cheaper early. The longer you wait, the more expensive it becomes. Start now.
