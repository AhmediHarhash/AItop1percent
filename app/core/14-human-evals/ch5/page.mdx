# Chapter 5 — Scaling and Workforce Planning

Every review operation eventually hits the scaling wall: the point where adding more reviewers no longer keeps pace with growing volume, and where the coordination overhead of a larger team starts eating into the capacity gains. This chapter covers both dimensions of the scaling problem—how to scale review operations intelligently and how to plan the workforce that makes scaling possible. From tiered review architectures to automation-assisted triage, from capacity forecasting to hiring pipelines, these are the operational foundations that determine whether your review operation grows gracefully or collapses under its own weight.

*Scaling is not about having more people. It is about building systems where more people actually produce proportionally more reviewed items without proportionally more errors.*
