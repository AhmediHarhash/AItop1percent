# 5.12 — Shrinkage, Ramp Curves, and Time-to-Proficiency

In early 2025, a content moderation team at a social media platform hired 200 new reviewers to handle a 50 percent volume increase. The hiring plan assumed each reviewer would deliver 35 productive hours per week starting week two. Capacity planning showed the team would meet SLAs by mid-February. By March, the team was still missing SLAs. Backlogs were growing. Existing reviewers were working overtime. The hiring plan had succeeded. The capacity plan had failed. The root cause: the plan ignored shrinkage, ramp curves, and the time it takes for a new reviewer to reach full productivity. The 200 new hires delivered less than 60 percent of expected capacity for their first three months. The gap was never closed.

Shrinkage is the percentage of scheduled time that reviewers are unavailable for active review work. Ramp curves describe how productivity increases from day one to full proficiency. Time-to-proficiency is the duration from first day to the point where a reviewer performs at the same speed and quality as a tenured team member. All three are predictable, measurable, and consistently underestimated in capacity planning. Teams that ignore them are perpetually understaffed.

## What Shrinkage Includes

Shrinkage is everything that reduces available productive time. Scheduled breaks, team meetings, one-on-one check-ins, calibration sessions, training, system downtime, planned time off, unplanned absences, onboarding for new hires, offboarding for departing reviewers. A reviewer scheduled for 40 hours per week does not deliver 40 hours of case review. The difference is shrinkage.

Breaks are mandatory in most labor jurisdictions and typically account for five to ten percent of scheduled time. Two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch in an eight-hour shift is 12.5 percent shrinkage. Some roles require additional rest breaks for cognitive load reasons, especially in high-stress domains like child safety content moderation.

Meetings are unavoidable. Weekly team meetings, monthly all-hands, quarterly planning sessions. A weekly one-hour team meeting is 2.5 percent shrinkage. A monthly two-hour all-hands is 1.25 percent shrinkage. One-on-one check-ins with managers add another one to two percent. Calibration sessions, where reviewers review cases together to align on guidelines, can add five to ten percent shrinkage during calibration weeks.

Training is the largest shrinkage component for new hires. Initial onboarding training for a content moderation role might be two weeks of full-time classroom training before the reviewer touches a single production case. That is 100 percent shrinkage for two weeks. After onboarding, ongoing training continues. Policy updates, new edge case scenarios, tool updates. A mature review operation schedules one to two hours of training per week per reviewer, which is 2.5 to five percent ongoing shrinkage.

System downtime happens. Tools crash. Queues go empty because upstream pipelines fail. Authentication systems have outages. Reviewers cannot review if the system is unavailable. Well-operated infrastructure has minimal downtime. Poorly operated infrastructure can have five to ten percent unplanned downtime, all of which becomes shrinkage.

Absences are both planned and unplanned. Planned absences include vacation, holidays, and personal days. In most regions, this is ten to 15 days per year, or four to six percent shrinkage. Unplanned absences include sick leave, family emergencies, and no-shows. Typical unplanned absence rates are two to five percent, higher in high-stress roles or environments with poor working conditions.

## Realistic Shrinkage Rates

For fully ramped, tenured reviewers, realistic shrinkage is 25 to 35 percent. A reviewer scheduled for 40 hours delivers 26 to 30 productive hours. The breakdown: ten percent for breaks, five percent for meetings, five percent for training and calibration, five percent for planned absences, three percent for unplanned absences, two percent for system issues and transitions. This is not slack. This is operational reality.

For new hires, shrinkage is significantly higher during the onboarding period. If onboarding training is two weeks, shrinkage is 100 percent for those two weeks. During the first month after training, shrinkage is 40 to 50 percent because new reviewers require frequent coaching, move more slowly, and make more errors that require rework. By month two, shrinkage drops to 35 to 45 percent. By month three, it approaches the steady-state 25 to 35 percent.

In high-turnover environments, shrinkage increases because the team always has a cohort of new hires. If monthly turnover is ten percent and time-to-proficiency is three months, 30 percent of the team is always in ramp status with elevated shrinkage. The team's blended shrinkage rate is higher than the steady-state rate. A team with ten percent monthly turnover and three-month ramp curves operates at 35 to 40 percent shrinkage instead of 30 percent.

Capacity planning that assumes 15 percent shrinkage is wrong by a factor of two. You will hire half the headcount you actually need. When you miss SLAs and ask why, the answer is always the same: you did not account for reality.

## Ramp Curves for New Hires

A ramp curve plots productivity over time from a reviewer's first day to full proficiency. Productivity can be measured as cases per hour, accuracy against calibration sets, or pass rate on quality audits. The curve is not linear. Productivity grows quickly in the first few weeks, then slows as the reviewer approaches full proficiency.

A typical ramp curve for a moderately complex review task looks like this: Week one, productivity is zero because the reviewer is in classroom training. Week two, productivity is 20 percent of tenured reviewer productivity because the reviewer is shadowing or reviewing with supervision. Week three, productivity is 40 percent. Week four, 60 percent. Week six, 75 percent. Week eight, 85 percent. Week 12, 95 percent. Full proficiency is reached at three months.

The shape of the curve depends on task complexity. Simple, rule-based tasks have faster ramps. A reviewer labeling sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral can reach 90 percent proficiency in four weeks. Complex, judgment-heavy tasks have slower ramps. A reviewer evaluating nuanced policy violations in long-form content might take six months to reach full proficiency.

The curve also depends on the quality of training and the availability of coaching. A well-designed onboarding program with structured training, immediate feedback, and accessible coaches produces faster ramps. A poorly designed program where new reviewers are given a PDF and told to start reviewing produces slower ramps and higher error rates during ramp.

Capacity planning must incorporate the ramp curve. If you hire 100 reviewers and assume they deliver full productivity starting week three, you will overestimate capacity by 50 percent for the first quarter. The correct approach is to model each cohort's ramp curve and calculate effective capacity week by week. A cohort of 100 reviewers hired in January delivers 20 full-time equivalent capacity in their first full week, 40 in their second week, 60 in their third week, and so on. The aggregate capacity of the team is the sum of each cohort's current effective capacity.

## Time-to-Proficiency by Task Complexity

Time-to-proficiency is the duration from first day to the point where a reviewer's speed and quality match a tenured reviewer. For simple tasks, time-to-proficiency is four to six weeks. For complex tasks, it is three to six months. For highly specialized tasks requiring deep domain knowledge, it can be six to twelve months.

Simple tasks have clear, objective criteria, limited context requirements, and minimal ambiguity. Labeling whether an image contains a car. Tagging customer support tickets by category. Validating that form fields are filled correctly. A new reviewer can reach proficiency quickly because the judgment is straightforward and errors are immediately identifiable.

Moderately complex tasks require more context, judgment, or multi-step reasoning. Evaluating whether user-generated content violates community guidelines. Summarizing customer complaints into structured fields. Reviewing financial documents for compliance with specific regulations. Time-to-proficiency is two to four months because the reviewer must internalize guidelines, develop pattern recognition, and learn edge case handling.

Highly complex tasks require domain expertise, nuanced judgment, and the ability to handle open-ended inputs. Medical coding for surgical procedures. Legal document review for contract compliance. Trust and safety review for coordinated inauthentic behavior. Time-to-proficiency is four to twelve months because the reviewer must develop domain knowledge that cannot be taught in a two-week training program.

Time-to-proficiency is measurable. Track handle time and quality by cohort over time. The point where a cohort's handle time and accuracy stabilize and match the tenured population is time-to-proficiency. For a content moderation team, this might be the point where median handle time is within ten percent of tenured reviewers and calibration accuracy is within five percent.

Time-to-proficiency determines hiring lead time. If time-to-proficiency is three months and you need 100 additional full-time equivalent reviewers by April, you must start hiring in January. If you start hiring in March, you will not have full capacity until June. Teams that do not account for ramp time are always behind.

## The Hidden Cost of Turnover

Turnover is the silent killer of review operations. Every departing reviewer is a loss of productivity. Every replacement hire requires onboarding, training, and ramp time during which they deliver reduced productivity. High turnover creates a perpetual state of understaffing even when headcount is nominally sufficient.

Calculate the turnover cost explicitly. If time-to-proficiency is three months and monthly turnover is ten percent, you lose ten percent of your team's capacity every month and spend three months ramping replacements. At steady state, 30 percent of your team is always in ramp status, delivering 60 to 70 percent of full productivity. Your effective capacity is 85 percent of your nominal headcount. If you need 100 full-time equivalent capacity, you need 118 actual reviewers.

The cost compounds in high-stress or low-engagement roles. Content moderation of disturbing material has higher turnover. Low-wage roles with no career progression have higher turnover. Remote roles with poor management have higher turnover. Turnover rates of 15 to 20 percent per month are common in the worst-run operations. At 20 percent monthly turnover, effective capacity is 70 to 75 percent of nominal headcount. You are running a hiring treadmill just to maintain capacity, let alone grow.

The corrective is to invest in retention. Retention has a measurable ROI. Reducing turnover from 15 percent per month to five percent per month increases effective capacity by 15 percent without hiring a single additional person. Retention interventions include better compensation, better working conditions, better management, career progression, psychological support for high-stress roles, and clear performance feedback. Every dollar spent on retention saves three dollars in hiring and training costs.

## Measuring and Reporting Ramp and Shrinkage

Measure shrinkage by comparing logged productive time to scheduled time. Every review tool should log handle time per case. Sum handle time per reviewer per week. Compare to scheduled shift hours. The difference is shrinkage. Report shrinkage by cohort: new hires in their first month, reviewers in months two through three, tenured reviewers. Report shrinkage by category: breaks, meetings, training, absences, system downtime. The breakdown tells you where time is going and where to optimize.

Measure ramp curves by tracking productivity by cohort over time. Cohort by start date. Plot median cases per hour and calibration accuracy by week since hire. The curve tells you how long it takes to reach proficiency and where the steepest learning happens. If productivity plateaus after six weeks but quality continues to improve for three months, your training focuses on speed but underinvests in quality development.

Report ramp and shrinkage in capacity planning dashboards. Current headcount, current cohort distribution, current effective capacity accounting for ramp status, current utilization, projected capacity over the next four weeks accounting for planned hires and their ramp curves. The dashboard should answer: do we have enough people, when do we run out of capacity, when do new hires reach full productivity.

Teams that measure and report ramp and shrinkage transparently make better hiring decisions, set realistic SLAs, and avoid the perpetual understaffing trap. Teams that do not measure these factors operate on hope and consistently fail.

## Planning for Attrition and Steady-State Hiring

Even in a stable team, you must hire continuously to replace natural attrition. If your team is 500 reviewers and monthly turnover is five percent, you lose 25 reviewers per month. You must hire 25 replacements per month just to maintain headcount. If time-to-proficiency is three months, you must maintain a hiring pipeline that delivers 25 fully onboarded new hires every month, which means starting 25 hires in the pipeline three months earlier.

Steady-state hiring is easier than surge hiring because the pipeline is predictable. You know your turnover rate. You know your ramp time. You know how many hires per month you need. Build a hiring machine that delivers that volume consistently. Hiring pipelines, recruiter capacity, interview panels, training schedules. All of it sized to steady-state demand.

Surge hiring is harder because it requires scaling the hiring machine temporarily. If you need to grow from 500 to 700 reviewers over three months, you must hire 200 additional reviewers on top of the 75 replacements for natural attrition. That is 275 hires in three months, or 92 per month, which is four times your steady-state hiring rate. Your recruiting team, your interview capacity, your training capacity, and your onboarding infrastructure must all scale temporarily. Most teams underestimate the lead time and bottleneck on recruiting, interviewing, or training.

The alternative to surge hiring is maintaining a contractor bench or using a staffing vendor. Contractor benches are pre-vetted, pre-trained reviewers who can be activated within one to two weeks. They are more expensive per hour than full-time employees but eliminate ramp time. Staffing vendors manage the hiring, training, and management for you. They deliver capacity on demand but at a significant cost premium. The trade-off is speed versus cost. Surge hiring in-house is cheaper but slower. Contractor benches and vendors are faster but more expensive.

Next: hiring pipelines and workforce planning cycles, where the organizational process of building and maintaining a review workforce becomes explicit.
