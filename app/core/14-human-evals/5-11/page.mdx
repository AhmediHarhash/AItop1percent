# 5.11 — Capacity Forecasting: Volume, Handle Time, and SLA Math

Capacity planning for human review is deterministic math. You have incoming volume, measured in cases per day or per hour. You have handle time, measured in minutes per case. You have target utilization, the percentage of a reviewer's shift spent actively reviewing. Multiply volume by handle time, divide by hours available per reviewer, adjust for utilization, and you get required headcount. The formula is simple. The inputs are not.

Volume is variable and often unpredictable. A product launch doubles review volume overnight. A policy change flags 40 percent more cases. A viral social media event creates a spike that lasts three days. Seasonal patterns affect some domains. Tax season for financial document review. Holiday shopping for fraud detection. Back-to-school for education content moderation. Handle time varies by case complexity, reviewer experience, and tooling quality. A new reviewer takes twice as long as a tenured one. A complex edge case takes ten times longer than a routine case. SLA requirements determine how much buffer capacity you need. A four-hour SLA requires near-real-time capacity matching. A 48-hour SLA allows batching and load smoothing.

The teams that get capacity planning right build forecasting models, measure inputs continuously, and adjust headcount proactively. The teams that get it wrong staff to average volume, get overwhelmed by variance, miss SLAs, and burn out their workforce trying to catch up.

## The Capacity Formula

The core formula is straightforward. Required hours equals volume times handle time. Required headcount equals required hours divided by productive hours per reviewer. Productive hours are not shift hours. They are shift hours times utilization. A reviewer working an eight-hour shift with 75 percent utilization delivers six productive hours.

Example: you have 10,000 cases per day. Median handle time is six minutes per case. That is 1,000 hours of review work per day. If each reviewer works an eight-hour shift at 75 percent utilization, each delivers six productive hours. You need 167 full-time equivalent reviewers to handle the volume with no buffer. Add a 20 percent buffer for variance and you need 200 reviewers.

The formula breaks when handle time is not constant. If 80 percent of cases take four minutes and 20 percent take 20 minutes, the weighted average handle time is seven minutes, but the distribution matters for capacity planning. A batch of 500 hard cases arrives at 3 PM. If your team is already near capacity, the SLA for those cases slips. You need either dynamic routing to specialized reviewers or buffer capacity to absorb the variance.

The formula also assumes reviewers are interchangeable. In practice, they are not. A senior reviewer handles hard cases faster than a junior reviewer. A domain expert handles nuanced judgment calls faster than a generalist. A reviewer familiar with a specific policy handles policy-related cases faster. Routing logic and skill-based assignment affect effective handle time. A team with perfect routing can handle more volume with the same headcount than a team with random assignment.

## Forecasting Volume

Volume forecasting starts with historical data. Plot daily volume for the past six months. Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies. A steady upward trend suggests product growth and requires headcount growth. Weekly seasonality suggests weekday-weekend patterns. Monthly seasonality suggests business cycles. Large spikes are either recurring events or one-time anomalies. Recurring events need planned capacity. One-time anomalies need incident response capacity but should not drive baseline staffing.

For stable products, historical forecasting works well. Apply a time-series model to historical volume. Adjust for known upcoming events: product launches, marketing campaigns, policy changes. Forecast volume daily or weekly for the next quarter. Translate volume into required headcount accounting for ramp time and hiring lead time.

For new products or rapidly scaling products, historical forecasting is unreliable. You have three months of data and volume is doubling every six weeks. Use leading indicators instead. Product usage metrics. Signup rates. Engagement metrics. If product signups predict review volume with a two-week lag, you can forecast review volume from signup trends. Build the correlation model early. By the time you have six months of review volume data, you are already understaffed.

The hardest forecasting problem is unpredictable spikes. A viral event, a security incident, a regulatory change. You cannot forecast these with historical data. You handle them with buffer capacity, surge staffing, or SLA relaxation. Buffer capacity is expensive but effective. Surge staffing requires a bench of trained contractors who can spin up within 48 hours. SLA relaxation is a business decision. If a viral event creates a ten-times spike for three days, you either accept a temporary SLA miss or you massively overprovision for a rare event.

## Measuring and Predicting Handle Time

Handle time is the average time a reviewer spends on a case from opening to submission. It includes reading, judgment, applying labels, writing notes, and any verification steps. It does not include breaks, meetings, training, or queue time. Most review tools log handle time automatically. If your tool does not, build the instrumentation immediately. You cannot forecast capacity without accurate handle time data.

Median handle time is more useful than mean handle time because handle time distributions are skewed. Most cases are fast. A small percentage of cases are very slow. The mean is pulled upward by outliers. The median represents the typical case. Report both. A median handle time of five minutes and a mean handle time of eight minutes tells you that most cases are fast but a long tail of slow cases is driving up average workload.

Handle time varies by reviewer experience. A new reviewer in their first week takes twice as long as a reviewer with six months of experience. Track handle time by cohort. Week-one reviewers, month-one reviewers, month-three reviewers, tenured reviewers. Use cohort-specific handle time in capacity planning. If you are hiring 50 new reviewers, they do not deliver full productivity on day one. They ramp over weeks or months. Your capacity plan must account for the ramp curve.

Handle time also varies by case complexity. If you can predict case complexity before assignment, you can forecast handle time more accurately. Use heuristics or a simple model. Long inputs take longer to review. Escalated cases take longer. Cases with multiple policy violations take longer. Cases flagged by multiple detection models take longer. Build a complexity score. Segment handle time by complexity. Use the segmented distribution in capacity forecasting.

## SLA-Driven Capacity Requirements

Service level agreements define how quickly cases must be reviewed. A common SLA structure is 90 percent of cases reviewed within four hours, 99 percent within 24 hours. The SLA determines how much buffer capacity you need and how tightly you must match capacity to real-time volume.

A tight SLA like four hours requires near-real-time capacity matching. If volume spikes at 10 AM, you need enough reviewers online at 10 AM to handle the spike within four hours. You cannot wait for the next shift. You cannot batch the work overnight. You need dynamic staffing. Some teams use shift scheduling to match capacity to expected intraday volume patterns. Morning shift, afternoon shift, evening shift, night shift. Each sized to the expected volume during that window. Other teams use flexible or on-call reviewers who can be brought online during spikes.

A loose SLA like 48 hours allows batching and load smoothing. Volume that arrives Monday can be reviewed Tuesday. Volume that arrives Friday can be reviewed Monday. You can staff to average daily volume over a multi-day window rather than real-time hourly volume. This is cheaper and operationally simpler but only works if the business can tolerate the delay.

The buffer capacity required also depends on volume variance. If volume is consistent, you can operate at higher utilization. If volume is highly variable, you need buffer capacity to absorb spikes without missing the SLA. A rule of thumb: for every ten percent increase in volume coefficient of variation, add five percent buffer capacity. High-variance environments require 20 to 30 percent buffer. Low-variance environments can operate at 85 to 90 percent utilization.

## Buffer Sizing and Reserve Capacity

Buffer capacity is the difference between your steady-state headcount and the headcount required to handle average volume. The buffer absorbs variance, planned absences, and unexpected spikes. Too little buffer and you miss SLAs during normal variance. Too much buffer and you are overstaffed most of the time, which is expensive and leads to underutilized reviewers.

The right buffer size depends on three factors: volume variance, SLA tightness, and cost tolerance. High variance and tight SLAs require larger buffers. Low variance and loose SLAs allow smaller buffers. Cost-sensitive organizations run smaller buffers and accept occasional SLA misses. Risk-averse organizations run larger buffers to ensure consistent SLA performance.

A typical buffer sizing approach: measure the 95th percentile daily volume over the past quarter. Staff to handle the 95th percentile volume at target utilization. This means you are overstaffed 95 percent of the time but have sufficient capacity to handle most spikes. For the remaining five percent of days, you either accept an SLA miss or activate surge capacity.

Surge capacity is reserve capacity that can be activated on short notice. Common surge mechanisms include overtime, contractor benches, and cross-trained internal teams. Overtime is simple but expensive and unsustainable. Contractor benches require maintaining a pool of trained, vetted reviewers who can spin up within 24 to 48 hours. Cross-trained internal teams can shift from other work to review work during crises but require ongoing training and readiness.

The most operationally mature teams maintain tiered surge capacity. Tier one: internal overtime, activated for small spikes lasting one to three days. Tier two: contractor bench, activated for medium spikes lasting one to two weeks. Tier three: emergency hiring, activated for sustained volume increases that justify permanent headcount growth. Each tier has a defined activation process, cost model, and expected ramp time.

## Incorporating Shrinkage and Realism

Shrinkage is the percentage of scheduled hours that reviewers are not actively reviewing. Shrinkage includes breaks, meetings, training, system downtime, planned absences, and unplanned absences. Actual productive time is scheduled time minus shrinkage. A common mistake in capacity planning is assuming reviewers are productive 100 percent of their shift. No one is.

Realistic shrinkage for human review operations is 25 to 40 percent. A reviewer scheduled for 40 hours per week delivers 24 to 30 productive hours. The remaining time is breaks, team meetings, one-on-ones, calibration sessions, training, system issues, and absence. Shrinkage is higher for new hires because they spend more time in training. Shrinkage is lower for fully ramped, tenured reviewers but never zero.

To measure shrinkage, compare logged handle time to scheduled shift time. If a reviewer is scheduled for 40 hours and logs 28 hours of handle time, shrinkage is 30 percent. Track shrinkage by cohort and by time period. Shrinkage spikes during training weeks, during calibration weeks, and during end-of-quarter all-hands meetings. Budget for it in capacity planning.

Capacity planning that ignores shrinkage consistently underestimates required headcount by 30 to 40 percent. You hire for 100 reviewers, assume full-time productivity, and discover you have the effective capacity of 65 reviewers. SLAs slip. Backlogs grow. You scramble to hire more. The corrective is to plan with realistic shrinkage from day one. If you need 100 full-time equivalent reviewers and shrinkage is 30 percent, you need 143 scheduled reviewers.

## Dynamic Forecasting and Continuous Adjustment

Capacity planning is not a once-per-quarter exercise. It is a continuous process. Volume changes. Handle time changes as tooling improves or tasks evolve. Reviewer experience distribution changes as you hire and as tenured reviewers leave. SLA requirements change as the business evolves. The capacity plan must adapt.

Best practice: update the capacity forecast weekly. Measure actual volume for the past week. Compare to forecast. Measure actual handle time by cohort. Compare to the model. Calculate current effective capacity accounting for headcount, ramp status, and shrinkage. Identify gaps. If volume is trending ten percent above forecast and hiring is behind plan, you will miss SLAs in four weeks. Escalate immediately.

The weekly update also surfaces leading indicators of capacity problems. Handle time is increasing because the task is getting harder. Shrinkage is increasing because turnover is high and you have a large cohort of new hires in training. Volume variance is increasing because the product is in a high-growth phase. Each signal suggests a different intervention. Increasing handle time requires tooling improvements or task simplification. Increasing shrinkage requires retention focus or faster ramp programs. Increasing variance requires larger buffer capacity or surge mechanisms.

The most operationally mature teams automate the capacity forecast. A dashboard displays current volume, current effective capacity, current utilization, and projected capacity gaps over the next four weeks. The forecast updates daily. Alerts fire when projected utilization exceeds thresholds or when projected capacity is insufficient to meet SLAs. The ops leader reviews the dashboard weekly, adjusts hiring plans, adjusts shift schedules, or activates surge capacity as needed.

Next: shrinkage, ramp curves, and time-to-proficiency, where the hidden costs of onboarding and turnover become explicit and measurable.
