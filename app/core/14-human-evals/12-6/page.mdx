# 12.6 — HIPAA Considerations for Healthcare Review

The auditor from the Office for Civil Rights stands in the data center walkthrough, asking to see where reviewers access patient data. The VP of Engineering pulls up the review platform on a laptop. The interface shows the patient's full name, date of birth, medical record number, and a clinical note about chest pain and shortness of breath. The auditor asks where the reviewer is located. The VP says the reviewer is a contractor in the Philippines. The auditor asks if the contractor signed a Business Associate Agreement. The VP says he thinks so, but he will need to check with Legal. The auditor asks if the platform logs every time a reviewer accesses protected health information. The VP says the system logs review submissions but not individual data access events. The auditor asks how the company ensures that reviewers only access the minimum necessary information. The VP says they show the full patient record so the reviewer can make an accurate judgment. The auditor stops writing notes and makes a call to the investigation team.

HIPAA is not a suggestion. It is a federal law with civil and criminal penalties for violations, enforced by an agency with investigative authority and a long history of multi-million-dollar settlements. When your AI system processes protected health information, and humans review that system's outputs or decisions, every component of the review infrastructure must comply with HIPAA Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule. The fact that the review is internal, the fact that reviewers are contractors, the fact that you are a technology company and not a healthcare provider — none of these exempt you. If you are a covered entity or a business associate handling PHI, HIPAA applies to your review operations.

## What Counts as PHI in Review Workflows

Protected Health Information under HIPAA is individually identifiable health information held or transmitted by a covered entity or business associate in any form. Individually identifiable means the information can be used to identify the individual and relates to their past, present, or future health condition, the provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare. HIPAA defines eighteen categories of identifiers, but the practical rule is simpler: if the information includes any identifier and any health-related content, it is PHI.

In human review workflows, PHI is present any time a reviewer sees a patient name, medical record number, date of birth, or any other identifier alongside health information. A reviewer evaluating whether a clinical summarization model correctly extracted key symptoms from a doctor's note is accessing PHI. A reviewer assessing whether a diagnostic recommendation model appropriately escalated a radiology report is accessing PHI. A reviewer checking whether a patient question about medication was answered correctly is accessing PHI. If the task requires seeing both the health information and any way to connect that information to an individual, the reviewer is accessing PHI.

De-identified data under HIPAA Safe Harbor or Expert Determination is not PHI. Safe Harbor requires removing all eighteen identifier categories and having no actual knowledge that the remaining information could be used to identify the individual. Expert Determination requires a qualified statistician to determine that the risk of re-identification is very small. Most review workflows cannot use de-identified data because the task requires context that Safe Harbor would remove. A reviewer cannot assess whether a model's clinical summary is accurate if the summary has no dates, no ages, no locations, and no specific clinical details. De-identification is possible for some review tasks — for example, evaluating the linguistic quality of a symptom description — but not for tasks requiring clinical accuracy.

The minimum necessary standard under the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that you limit PHI use, disclosure, and requests to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. For review workflows, this means showing reviewers only the PHI required to make the specific judgment you are asking them to make. Not the entire medical record. Not the full patient history. Not every data field the model accessed. The specific subset needed for the review decision.

## Business Associate Agreements for Review Vendors

If you are a covered entity and you engage a vendor to perform review services that involve access to PHI, that vendor is your business associate under HIPAA. If you are a business associate and you subcontract review work, your vendor becomes a subcontractor business associate. In both cases, you must have a written Business Associate Agreement in place before the vendor accesses any PHI. Operating without a BAA is a HIPAA violation that survives even if no breach occurs.

A compliant BAA must specify the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI by the business associate, require the associate to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, require reporting of breaches and security incidents, require the associate to ensure any subcontractors agree to the same restrictions, prohibit the associate from using or disclosing PHI except as permitted by the agreement, and require the associate to return or destroy PHI at the termination of the contract.

The BAA cannot be a light contract. It must be detailed, enforceable, and aligned with HIPAA requirements. Many annotation vendors offer generic BAAs designed for low-risk scenarios. If the vendor's BAA does not explicitly cover the types of PHI your reviewers will access, does not require encryption in transit and at rest, does not specify breach notification timelines, or does not grant you audit rights, the BAA is insufficient. You must negotiate terms that actually protect PHI, or you must find a different vendor.

The BAA must be executed before any PHI is disclosed. Not after the pilot. Not after the first batch of review cases. Before. If your procurement process takes six weeks and you need reviewers to start tomorrow, you delay the start until the BAA is signed. If you disclose PHI to a vendor without a BAA, you have violated the Privacy Rule, and the vendor is not legally bound to protect the data. The OCR has settled cases based solely on the absence of BAAs with entities that accessed PHI. The presence or absence of actual harm is not the determining factor — the regulatory violation is the lack of the required contract.

Subcontractor BAAs are equally mandatory. If your annotation vendor subcontracts to another vendor, that subcontractor must have a BAA with your vendor, and you must authorize the subcontracting arrangement. If your vendor does not disclose their subcontractors, you cannot verify compliance. If they refuse to provide subcontractor information, you cannot use them for PHI review.

## Security Rule Requirements for Review Systems

The HIPAA Security Rule requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic PHI. These safeguards apply to every system that stores, processes, or transmits ePHI — including human review platforms. The safeguards are organized into required implementation specifications and addressable implementation specifications. Required means you must implement them. Addressable means you must implement them unless you document why they are not reasonable and appropriate for your organization and implement an equivalent alternative.

Access controls are required. You must implement technical policies and procedures that allow access to ePHI only to authorized persons or software programs. For review platforms, this means role-based access control, unique user identification, automatic logoff after inactivity, and emergency access procedures. Every reviewer must have a unique account. Shared credentials are prohibited. Access must be granted based on job function and revoked immediately when the reviewer's role ends. If a reviewer works on multiple projects, they must only have access to the PHI relevant to their current assignments.

Audit controls are required. You must implement hardware, software, or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in systems containing ePHI. For review platforms, this means logging every access to PHI — who accessed it, when, what data was viewed, what action was taken, and from what IP address. Logs must be retained for at least six years under HIPAA's general documentation retention requirement. Logs must be protected from tampering and reviewed regularly for unauthorized access.

Integrity controls are required. You must implement policies and procedures to protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction. For review platforms, this means ensuring that annotations cannot be changed after submission without logging the change, that deleted review cases are logged and recoverable if required, and that no unauthorized modification of PHI can occur during the review process. If a reviewer can edit patient data while reviewing a case, that capability must be logged, restricted to authorized roles, and subject to audit.

Transmission security is required. You must implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI being transmitted over an electronic communications network. For review platforms, this means encrypting PHI in transit using TLS 1.2 or later. Unencrypted transmission of PHI — whether over the internet, internal networks, or between services — is a Security Rule violation.

Encryption and decryption are addressable specifications, not required. But if you choose not to encrypt ePHI at rest, you must document why encryption is not reasonable and appropriate for your organization and implement an equivalent alternative measure. In practice, nearly every organization encrypts ePHI at rest because the alternative justification is difficult to defend in an audit. For review systems, encryption at rest means that review databases, file storage, backups, and any exported datasets containing PHI are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms.

Workstation security and device and media controls are physical safeguards that apply to reviewer workstations. If reviewers access PHI from their own devices, you must implement policies that govern the use of those devices, require screen locks, prohibit unauthorized software, and ensure devices are encrypted. If reviewers work from home, their home network is part of your HIPAA environment for the duration of their access. If they work from a shared office, you must ensure their workstation screen is not visible to unauthorized persons. These are not theoretical requirements. OCR settlements have been based on breaches resulting from lost or stolen unencrypted devices used by business associate employees.

## Breach Notification and Risk Assessment

A breach under HIPAA is an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI that compromises the security or privacy of the information. Unlike GDPR, which requires notification within seventy-two hours for most breaches, HIPAA requires notification within sixty days — but only if the breach affects 500 or more individuals. For breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals, you maintain a log and report annually. However, if a breach affects even one individual, you must conduct a risk assessment to determine whether the breach must be reported.

The risk assessment must evaluate four factors: the nature and extent of the PHI involved, the unauthorized person who used or received the PHI, whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed, and the extent to which the risk has been mitigated. If the assessment concludes there is a low probability that the PHI has been compromised, the breach does not require individual notification. But the assessment must be documented, and OCR can challenge your conclusion.

For review systems, common breach scenarios include unauthorized access by a reviewer to cases outside their assigned project, accidental disclosure of PHI in a review export sent to the wrong recipient, compromise of a reviewer account allowing an attacker to access PHI, or loss of an unencrypted device containing review data. Each scenario requires a risk assessment. If a reviewer accessed 50 cases they were not authorized to see, you must assess whether the nature of the data, the reviewer's role, and the context create a significant risk of harm. If a developer exported annotated cases to a shared Slack channel, you must assess whether the channel members are covered by BAAs, whether the data was actually viewed, and whether deletion mitigates the risk.

Most organizations over-report to avoid the risk of OCR determining later that a breach should have been reported. The penalty for failing to report a reportable breach is significantly higher than the cost of reporting a breach that did not strictly require notification. If you are uncertain, consult legal counsel and err on the side of notification.

Breach notification to individuals must include a description of what happened, the types of PHI involved, steps individuals should take to protect themselves, what your organization is doing in response, and contact information for questions. The notification must be in plain language, not legal jargon. If the breach affects 500 or more individuals, you must also notify prominent media outlets and the Secretary of HHS. Media notification has reputational consequences that extend far beyond regulatory penalties.

## Minimum Necessary in Review Interface Design

The minimum necessary standard requires limiting PHI use and disclosure to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose. For review workflows, this means designing interfaces that show only the PHI required for the specific review task. The entire patient record is almost never necessary. The model's output plus the relevant context is typically sufficient.

A reviewer evaluating whether a clinical summarization model correctly extracted key symptoms from a patient note needs to see the original note and the model's summary. They do not need the patient's full medical history, their insurance information, their address, or their social security number. Show the note, show the summary, assign a case ID, and remove all other identifiers. The reviewer can make a correct judgment without knowing who the patient is.

A reviewer assessing whether a diagnostic recommendation escalated appropriately needs to see the presenting symptoms, the test results, the model's recommendation, and the actual outcome. They do not need the patient's name, date of birth, or medical record number. Pseudonymize the case and provide only the clinical data relevant to the decision being reviewed.

The challenge is that minimum necessary is not defined by a fixed standard. It depends on the purpose. A reviewer conducting a quality audit might need more context than a reviewer performing a binary correctness check. A clinical expert reviewing for safety might need access to more of the patient's history than a linguistic reviewer assessing readability. The principle is that you must evaluate what is necessary for each role and each task, and you must document that evaluation.

In practice, this means building parameterized review interfaces that expose different fields based on the review task. A quality review task shows clinical details but hides identifiers. An escalation review task might show identifiers because the reviewer needs to pull additional records from the EHR to verify the decision. A training review task shows only de-identified cases. The same platform supports multiple views, and access to each view is controlled by role.

The minimum necessary standard also applies to which reviewers have access to which cases. If your review operation handles both behavioral health and cardiology cases, a reviewer working on cardiology should not have access to behavioral health cases. If your platform serves multiple hospital systems, a reviewer working on cases for Hospital A should not have access to cases from Hospital B. Segmentation by data source, by clinical specialty, and by sensitivity level is part of minimum necessary enforcement.

## Accounting of Disclosures and Patient Rights

HIPAA grants patients the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of their PHI for the six years prior to the request. Disclosures for treatment, payment, healthcare operations, and disclosures to the patient themselves are excluded from the accounting requirement. Disclosures for research, public health, and most other purposes must be included.

If your human review operation involves disclosures of PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, you may be required to provide an accounting if a patient requests it. This means maintaining a log of every disclosure, including the date, the recipient, a description of the PHI disclosed, and the purpose. For review workflows, this could include disclosures to annotation vendors, disclosures to third-party auditors, or disclosures for model training if training is not considered healthcare operations.

Most review activities fall under healthcare operations, which includes quality assessment, training programs, and business management. If the review is conducted to improve the accuracy of a clinical decision support system used in patient care, it is healthcare operations, and disclosures to reviewers do not require accounting. But if the review is conducted to train a model that will be sold to other organizations, it may be considered research or commercial activity, and disclosures may require accounting.

The safe approach is to document the purpose of every review activity and consult privacy counsel to determine whether it qualifies as healthcare operations. If it does not, implement disclosure logging that supports accounting requests.

Patients also have the right to request restrictions on uses and disclosures of their PHI. A patient can ask that their information not be used for a specific purpose, and the covered entity must consider the request but is not required to agree — except in one case. If the patient pays out of pocket in full and requests that information about a service not be disclosed to their health plan, the provider must agree. For review workflows, this means that if a patient paid out of pocket and restricted disclosure to their insurer, you cannot include that patient's data in review cases that are accessible to entities acting on behalf of the insurer. This is rare, but it is a legal obligation.

## Training Requirements for Reviewers Accessing PHI

The HIPAA Security Rule requires that you train all members of your workforce on the policies and procedures regarding PHI. Workforce includes employees, volunteers, trainees, and contractors who work under your direct control. For review vendors, the vendor is responsible for training their own workforce, but you must verify that training occurs.

HIPAA training must cover the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, the organization's policies, the consequences of violations, and the individual's responsibilities. Training must be provided to new workforce members within a reasonable period of hire, to existing workforce members when policies change, and periodically as a refresher. Documentation of training completion must be retained for six years.

For review contractors, this means the vendor must provide HIPAA training to every reviewer before they access PHI. The training must be specific to the review task — not generic. A thirty-minute online module from 2019 covering general HIPAA concepts is not sufficient if the reviewer will be accessing sensitive psychiatric notes in a review platform. The training must address the types of PHI the reviewer will see, the permitted uses, the prohibition on unauthorized disclosure, and the specific security practices required.

You must verify that training occurred. This means requesting training completion certificates from the vendor, reviewing the training curriculum to ensure it covers the required topics, and conducting periodic audits to confirm that new reviewers are not accessing PHI before training is complete. If a breach occurs and the investigation reveals that the reviewer responsible had not completed HIPAA training, both you and the vendor are liable.

Training is not a one-time event. Refresher training is required whenever policies change, whenever new types of PHI are introduced into the review workflow, and whenever a breach or near-miss occurs that reveals a gap in understanding. If a reviewer accidentally sends PHI to an unauthorized recipient, that reviewer and all reviewers with similar roles should receive immediate retraining on secure communication practices.

## Sanctions and Enforcement for Unauthorized Access

The HIPAA Security Rule requires that you apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply with policies and procedures. This applies to reviewers who access PHI without authorization, who disclose PHI improperly, or who violate security practices.

Sanctions must be documented and enforced consistently. If a reviewer accesses a patient record for curiosity rather than job function, the sanction might range from a written warning to termination depending on the severity and the organization's policy. If a reviewer shares PHI with an unauthorized person, termination is often the appropriate response. If a reviewer fails to lock their workstation and another person views PHI on their screen, retraining and a written warning might be appropriate.

The key is that sanctions must be applied. If you discover unauthorized access and do nothing, you have violated the Security Rule's sanctions requirement. If you discover a pattern of policy violations and respond only with verbal warnings that are not documented, you cannot demonstrate compliance in an audit.

For vendor-managed reviewers, the BAA must require the vendor to apply sanctions for workforce violations. You must verify that the vendor has a sanctions policy, that it is enforced, and that you are notified when violations occur. If a vendor repeatedly fails to sanction reviewers who violate policies, you must terminate the vendor relationship or accept liability for ongoing non-compliance.

HIPAA compliance in human review infrastructure is not about checking boxes on a readiness questionnaire. It is about building systems that protect patient privacy through technical controls, enforcing policies through documentation and sanctions, training every person who accesses PHI, limiting access to the minimum necessary, managing vendor relationships through enforceable contracts, and maintaining the evidence required to demonstrate compliance when OCR comes asking. The regulation assumes healthcare data is sensitive, assumes humans are a risk vector, and requires that you treat review workflows with the same rigor as clinical systems.

The transition to financial services compliance shares the emphasis on audit trails and vendor oversight, but the regulatory focus shifts from patient privacy to financial accuracy and investor protection.
