# Chapter 11 — Secure Review Environments

Human reviewers see your most sensitive data. They view customer conversations, patient records, financial transactions, legal documents—everything your AI system processes flows through their screens. If your review infrastructure is compromised, every piece of content your reviewers have ever seen is at risk. This chapter covers the security controls that protect review operations: redaction and just-in-time reveal, watermarking and copy prevention, virtual desktop infrastructure for vendors, tenant isolation, tamper-evident logging, data classification, secure destruction, vendor access controls, and the physical security requirements for on-premise review facilities. The security of your review environment is not separate from the security of your AI system—it is the same attack surface.
