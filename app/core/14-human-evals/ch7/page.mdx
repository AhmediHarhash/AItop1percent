# Chapter 7 — Safety and Trust Reviewer Operations

Safety review is not regular review with darker content. It is a fundamentally different operational challenge that requires specialized infrastructure, psychological support systems, and cross-functional coordination that general review operations never need. The reviewers who handle hate speech, violence, self-harm, and extremism face occupational hazards that can cause lasting psychological harm. This chapter covers the unique operational requirements of safety and trust review: specialized queues, trauma exposure controls, psychological support, secure viewing, escalation protocols, content limits, incident triage, and cross-functional coordination with Trust and Safety, Legal, and Policy teams.
