# 11.10 — Physical Security for On-Premise Review Operations

The door to the secure review room requires a badge, a PIN, and a biometric scan. Inside, twelve reviewers sit at workstations with privacy screens, no USB ports, and cameras positioned to ensure no one photographs the screen. A security officer monitors the room through glass. No phones, no bags, no external storage devices allowed past the entrance. Every session is logged. Every departure is verified. This is not a military installation. It is a contract research organization conducting medical record reviews for a health system's AI safety evaluation. The data on those screens — patient names, diagnoses, treatment histories — is worth protecting, and the only way to protect it when humans must see it is to control the physical space where the seeing happens.

Most review operations happen in the cloud, accessed remotely by distributed annotators or internal teams working from home. But some data is too sensitive, too regulated, or too contractually restricted to allow remote access. Government data classified at Secret or above cannot leave approved facilities. Certain financial data under PCI-DSS cannot be accessed from personal devices. Some healthcare datasets under IRB restrictions require controlled environments with video monitoring and access logging. When remote access is prohibited, physical security becomes the control layer. And unlike network security, where you can audit logs and monitor traffic in real time, physical security failures are often discovered only after the breach.

## The Facility Access Control Model

Physical security begins at the perimeter. Not everyone who works in the building should have access to the review area. Not everyone with access to the review area should have access every day. Access is granted based on role, need, and schedule. The review area is separated from general office space by locked doors, controlled entry points, and if the data is sufficiently sensitive, by airgap from the corporate network.

The entry control system logs every badge swipe, every biometric authentication, every granted or denied access attempt. The log records the individual's identity, the time, the door or access point, the method of authentication, and the result. Failed access attempts are flagged for security review. Access outside of scheduled hours triggers an alert. Access by individuals not on the approved roster is blocked, and an alert is sent to the security operations center.

Access approval is role-based but time-limited. A reviewer approved to work Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM cannot enter the facility at 7 PM on Saturday. If they need after-hours access — to complete a high-priority review, to meet a deadline, to respond to an incident — they must request an exception. The request is logged, approved by a supervisor, and the access grant is valid for the specific time window requested. After the window expires, access reverts to the normal schedule.

Some facilities implement multi-factor physical access control. A badge alone is not sufficient. The individual must also enter a PIN, provide a fingerprint or iris scan, and in some cases, be visually verified by a security officer or video monitoring system. This layered approach prevents unauthorized access via stolen or cloned badges. If someone takes a reviewer's badge, they still cannot enter without the biometric or PIN.

## Workstation Hardening and Device Restrictions

The workstations inside the secure review area are not standard corporate laptops. They are purpose-built for controlled access to sensitive data. USB ports are disabled or physically removed. CD/DVD drives are absent. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are disabled at the firmware level. The only network connection is a wired Ethernet link to the isolated review network. The workstation cannot connect to the internet, cannot access corporate file shares, and cannot run unapproved software.

Data cannot be copied off the workstation. There is no clipboard that works across sessions. There is no print function unless printing is explicitly required and routed to a secure printer inside the controlled area. There is no email client, no cloud storage app, no Slack or Teams. The workstation runs a locked-down OS image that is rebuilt nightly. Anything saved to local disk is wiped overnight. If a reviewer needs to save work in progress, they save it to a network share within the review environment, which is subject to the same access controls and logging as the workstations themselves.

The screen is physically secured. Privacy filters prevent viewing from an angle. In high-security environments, the workstation is positioned so that no one can see the screen except the reviewer and the security officer monitoring the room. Some facilities use screen recording software that captures everything the reviewer sees, creating a video audit trail. If a data leak occurs, the recording can be reviewed to determine what was displayed, when, and whether the reviewer took any unauthorized actions.

Peripheral devices are controlled. If the review task requires annotation with a stylus, the stylus is provided by the facility and cannot be removed. If voice input is required, the microphone is integrated into the workstation and cannot be disconnected. No external keyboards, mice, or monitors are permitted. The reviewer uses the equipment provided, under the conditions enforced.

## Data Handling Protocols Inside the Secure Area

Reviewers inside the secure area follow strict data handling protocols. They do not discuss the content of reviews outside the secure area. They do not take notes on paper unless the paper is controlled — numbered, logged, and stored in a locked cabinet when not in use. They do not photograph screens, even with facility-provided cameras. They do not verbally share details with other reviewers unless collaboration is explicitly part of the workflow.

When a review session ends, the reviewer logs out. The system locks the workstation. The data is cleared from local cache. The reviewer does not leave the workstation unlocked, even for a moment. If they need a break, they log out. If they need to leave the room, they log out. An unattended, logged-in workstation is a security violation that triggers an incident report.

Collaboration, when required, happens under controlled conditions. If two reviewers need to discuss a case, they do so inside the secure area, in a designated collaboration space that is video monitored and logged. They do not discuss cases in hallways, break rooms, or outside the facility. The rule is simple: data discussed inside stays inside.

Printed materials are treated as controlled documents. If a reviewer prints a report, the print job is logged with their identity, the timestamp, and the document name. The printed page is numbered and tracked. When the reviewer finishes with it, the document is either returned to a secure cabinet or shredded using a cross-cut shredder inside the secure area. Printed documents do not leave the room. Shredded material is collected in locked bins and destroyed by a certified destruction service.

## Visitor Management and Observation Rules

Not everyone entering the secure area is a reviewer. Occasionally, auditors, inspectors, executives, or vendor representatives need access. These visitors are subject to stricter controls than regular reviewers. They do not have badges. They are escorted at all times. They do not touch workstations unless specifically authorized. They do not take photos, even of the room layout, without explicit approval.

Visitor access is logged with the visitor's name, organization, purpose of visit, escort identity, entry and exit times, and any areas accessed. Before entry, the visitor signs a nondisclosure agreement and a security acknowledgment. They surrender phones, cameras, and bags at the entrance. They are briefed on the rules: no photography, no note-taking unless approved, no discussion of observed data outside the facility.

Auditors and inspectors may need to observe review sessions to verify compliance with protocols. They stand behind the reviewer, watch the screen, and verify that procedures are followed. They do not interact with the data. They do not touch the workstation. Their role is purely observational. Their presence is logged. If they take notes, those notes are reviewed before they leave the facility to ensure they contain no sensitive data.

Executive visits are minimized. If a VP or C-level leader wants to see the review operation, they are shown the facility layout and the process overview, but they do not observe live data unless absolutely necessary. The risk of accidental or casual disclosure is too high. Leaders are briefed on metrics, workflows, and operational status in a separate briefing room, not inside the secure review area.

## Surveillance, Monitoring, and Incident Detection

The secure review area is under continuous surveillance. Cameras cover every workstation, every entry point, and every collaboration space. The video is recorded, timestamped, and retained for a defined period — typically 90 days to one year, depending on regulatory requirements. The surveillance system is monitored in real time by security personnel or by automated analytics that detect anomalies.

Anomaly detection looks for behaviors that violate protocol. A reviewer leaning close to another reviewer's screen. A reviewer holding up a phone, even if the phone was not supposed to make it past security screening. A reviewer writing on paper that was not logged. A reviewer accessing a workstation outside their assigned station. Each of these triggers an alert. Security reviews the video, determines whether a violation occurred, and escalates if necessary.

Audio monitoring is less common but used in the highest-security environments. Microphones in the review area capture conversations. The audio is analyzed for keywords related to data exfiltration, unauthorized collaboration, or discussion of sensitive data. If a reviewer says "I will send you this later" or "let me take a photo" or mentions a patient name while not actively reviewing a case, the system flags it for review.

Incident detection also relies on access logs and system logs. If a reviewer's badge is used to enter the facility while their workstation shows an active session from an hour earlier, that is an anomaly. Either someone else is using their workstation, or the logout protocol was not followed. Security investigates. If a workstation makes a network request to an unapproved IP address, that is an anomaly. The workstation should only communicate with the review application server. Any other traffic suggests misconfiguration or compromise.

When an incident is detected, the response is immediate. The reviewer is questioned. The video is reviewed. The workstation is locked and forensically imaged. Access is suspended pending investigation. If the incident represents a data breach — unauthorized disclosure, exfiltration, or access by an uncleared individual — the breach response protocol is activated, regulators are notified if required, and the affected data is logged for notification or remediation.

## Environmental and Anti-Tampering Controls

The secure review area is not just locked. It is monitored for tampering. Motion sensors detect after-hours movement. Door sensors detect forced entry. Environmental sensors detect power loss, temperature anomalies, or water intrusion that could damage equipment or create a distraction for unauthorized access.

Networking equipment and servers that support the review environment are locked in separate, access-controlled rooms. The server room requires separate badge access, separate logging, and in some facilities, separate biometric authentication. Physical access to servers is granted only to authorized IT staff and only when there is a documented need. Access is escorted. Work is logged. Changes to server configurations are reviewed before and after.

Anti-tampering measures also apply to the workstations themselves. Tamper-evident seals on the case detect if someone opens the chassis to install hardware keyloggers or access internal storage. If a seal is broken, the workstation is removed from service and inspected. The individual who last used the workstation is questioned. The incident is logged.

Secure destruction of decommissioned equipment is contractually required. When a workstation is replaced, the hard drive is removed and destroyed using a certified destruction process — degaussing for magnetic drives, physical shredding for SSDs. Certificates of destruction are retained for audit. No decommissioned device leaves the facility with data intact.

## Emergency Egress and Continuity Planning

Physical security must not compromise safety. In the event of fire, medical emergency, or other crisis, reviewers must be able to exit the secure area immediately, even if that means bypassing access controls. Emergency exits are clearly marked, unlocked from the inside, and alarmed. Opening an emergency exit triggers an alert, logs the event, and notifies security, but it does not lock the door or trap people inside.

After an emergency evacuation, the secure area is treated as potentially compromised. Security conducts a sweep to verify that no unauthorized individuals entered during the evacuation, that no equipment was tampered with, and that no data was left exposed on unlocked workstations. If the evacuation lasted more than a few minutes, workstations are rebooted, sessions are terminated, and reviewers must re-authenticate when operations resume.

Continuity planning accounts for extended facility unavailability. If the secure review area becomes inaccessible due to flood, fire, or other disaster, the organization has a secondary facility with equivalent controls. Data is replicated to the secondary site, or the review workflow is paused until the primary site is restored. The continuity plan is tested annually. Reviewers are trained on the secondary site. Access controls are pre-configured. The goal is to resume operations within 24 to 48 hours without compromising security.

## Regulatory and Contractual Justifications for Physical Security

Physical security is expensive. It requires dedicated space, specialized equipment, security personnel, and continuous monitoring. Organizations adopt it only when the cost is justified by regulatory requirements, contractual obligations, or risk tolerance.

For government contracts involving classified or controlled unclassified information, physical security is non-negotiable. The facility must meet NIST SP 800-171 or CMMC requirements, which specify access controls, surveillance, visitor management, and incident response. Auditors verify compliance before awarding contracts. Failure to maintain compliance results in contract termination.

For HIPAA-regulated data, physical security is required if the data is accessed in a form that could be viewed by unauthorized individuals. A review facility where patient records are displayed on screens must ensure that only authorized reviewers see those screens. This is enforced through access controls, privacy screens, and surveillance. Audits verify that the facility meets the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

For PCI-DSS, cardholder data environments must meet physical security requirements including restricted access, video surveillance, and visitor logging. If your review operation involves evaluating payment card data, your facility must be compliant. Quarterly scans, annual audits, and continuous monitoring are standard.

Some contracts impose physical security requirements even when regulations do not. A large enterprise customer may require that their data be reviewed only in facilities with specific certifications, specific access controls, and specific monitoring capabilities. These contractual requirements become binding, and the vendor must meet them or lose the contract.

## Scaling Physical Security Across Multiple Sites

As review operations grow, they often expand to multiple sites — regional offices, offshore facilities, partner locations. Each site must meet the same physical security standards. Inconsistent controls across sites create gaps that attackers or auditors will find.

The solution is standardized facility design and centralized monitoring. Each secure review facility is built to the same specification — same access control systems, same workstation configurations, same surveillance systems, same incident response protocols. Security policies are defined centrally and enforced locally. Access approvals, visitor logs, and incident reports flow to a central security operations center that monitors all sites.

Centralized monitoring allows real-time visibility across the organization. If a reviewer at the Singapore facility triggers an access anomaly, the security operations center in the US sees it immediately. If an auditor visits the London facility, the central compliance team is notified and can provide documentation or support. This centralization prevents drift, where individual sites gradually relax controls or implement local variations that create risk.

Some organizations use third-party facility auditors to verify compliance across sites. The auditor visits each location, tests access controls, reviews logs, interviews staff, and produces a compliance report. Sites that fail are required to remediate within a defined timeline. This independent verification ensures that remote sites do not cut corners or self-certify compliance without evidence.

Physical security is not obsolete in the age of cloud computing and remote work. It is the necessary control layer when the sensitivity of the data, the requirements of the regulation, or the obligations of the contract prohibit remote access. It is expensive, operationally complex, and difficult to scale, but when it is required, it is not optional. The next chapter covers post-review workflows — how outputs flow from reviewers to systems, how feedback is incorporated, and how the review loop closes.
