# Human Review Infrastructure

Human review is where AI systems meet human judgment at scale. The infrastructure you build determines whether human reviewers can work efficiently, consistently, and sustainably—or whether they burn out, drift apart in their judgments, and produce labels that undermine every downstream system. This section covers the complete architecture of human review operations: queue design, reviewer tooling, calibration systems, workforce planning, safety review protocols, decision defensibility, ML integration, secure environments, and governance frameworks.

- **Chapter 1 — Foundations of Human Review Infrastructure**: Why review infrastructure is the invisible bottleneck, the true costs of review, maturity levels, and system design principles.

- **Chapter 2 — Review Queue Architecture**: Queue routing, priority systems, load balancing, SLA enforcement, multi-stage pipelines, and backlog management.

- **Chapter 3 — Reviewer Tooling and UX Design**: Interface design, annotation surfaces, keyboard workflows, dashboards, model-assisted review, and confidence visualization.

- **Chapter 4 — Calibration and Guideline Management**: Golden sets, blind duplicates, drift detection, cross-team calibration, and guideline change control with RFC processes.

- **Chapter 5 — Scaling and Workforce Planning**: Tiered review, automation-assisted review, capacity forecasting, shrinkage models, and hiring pipelines.

- **Chapter 6 — Quality Assurance in Review**: Audit sampling, agreement metrics, error pattern analysis, feedback loops, and performance tiers.

- **Chapter 7 — Safety and Trust Reviewer Operations**: Specialized safety queues, trauma exposure controls, psychological support, and cross-functional escalation.

- **Chapter 8 — Disagreement Resolution and Decision Defensibility**: Adjudication workflows, rationale templates, evidence rules, legal holds, and appeals processes.

- **Chapter 9 — Integration with ML Pipelines**: Active learning, correction propagation, labels versus review artifacts, and artifact normalization for automation.

- **Chapter 10 — Metrics and Analytics for Review Operations**: Throughput, quality, latency, cost metrics, and protection against metrics gaming.

- **Chapter 11 — Secure Review Environments**: Redaction modes, watermarking, VDI access, tenant isolation, and tamper-evident logging.

- **Chapter 12 — Governance, Compliance, and Human Oversight**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, EU AI Act human oversight requirements, right to contest, and audit-ready proof.

*The difference between a functional review operation and a world-class one is infrastructure. Build it right, and your reviewers become a force multiplier. Build it wrong, and they become your most expensive bottleneck.*
