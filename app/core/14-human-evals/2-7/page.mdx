# 2.7 — SLA Enforcement in Review Queues

In August 2025, a financial services company discovered that 34 percent of their fraud review cases were missing their 2-hour SLA. The cases were being reviewed, but hours or days late. Customer accounts were frozen for 18 hours instead of 2. Support tickets piled up. The review team insisted they were working as fast as possible. The operations team insisted the SLA was mandatory. The root cause was not effort or capacity. The root cause was that the SLA was measured but not enforced. Cases that missed their deadline stayed in the same queue as cases that had not. No one was alerted when a case approached breach. No one was accountable when a case did breach. The SLA was a report, not a constraint. The review system treated it as optional, and so it was.

SLAs without enforcement are wishes. An SLA that says "reviewed within 4 hours" but takes action only after 12 hours is not a 4-hour SLA. It is a 12-hour SLA with a 4-hour aspiration. The gap between the SLA and the behavior is the gap between what the organization says it values and what it actually prioritizes. Enforcement closes that gap. Enforcement means the system and the organization respond when an SLA is at risk. The response is automatic, visible, and consequential.

## SLA Tier Design

Not every case deserves the same SLA. A high-severity security incident requires review within 15 minutes. A low-priority quality audit can wait 7 days. Treating every case as equally urgent creates two failure modes: wasting capacity on low-priority work and under-serving high-priority work. SLA tier design separates cases into priority bands, assigns each band an SLA, and enforces those SLAs independently.

The most common tier structure is three levels: urgent, standard, and low-priority. Urgent cases have SLAs measured in minutes to hours. Standard cases have SLAs measured in hours to days. Low-priority cases have SLAs measured in days to weeks. The specific numbers depend on the domain. A content moderation system might use 15 minutes for urgent, 4 hours for standard, and 48 hours for low-priority. A legal review system might use 2 hours for urgent, 2 days for standard, and 7 days for low-priority. The tier definitions are domain-specific, but the structure is universal: separate urgent from routine from deferrable.

Each tier must have a clear definition. Urgent means customer-blocking, safety-critical, or regulatory-mandated. Standard means normal business operations with user visibility. Low-priority means internal quality checks or non-urgent audits. The definition cannot be subjective. A case is not urgent because the submitter feels it is urgent. A case is urgent because it meets the criteria for urgent. The criteria are explicit, documented, and enforced at submission time. A submitter who marks a case as urgent when it does not meet the criteria receives an error message: this case does not meet urgent criteria, submitted as standard.

Tier assignment must also be locked after submission. A case submitted as standard cannot be silently upgraded to urgent to bypass the standard queue. Upgrades are allowed, but they require approval and are logged. A product manager who repeatedly upgrades cases to urgent to skip the queue is flagged. The pattern is reviewed. Tier manipulation undermines the entire SLA system. The enforcement must extend to the submitters, not just the reviewers.

## Clock Management

SLA enforcement begins with clock management: when does the SLA start, and when does it stop? The most common start time is submission time. A case submitted at 10:00 AM with a 4-hour SLA must be completed by 2:00 PM. The clock starts the moment the case enters the queue. The rule is simple and unambiguous. It is also incorrect for some case types.

Some cases have dependencies. A case submitted at 10:00 AM requires data from an upstream system. The data does not arrive until 11:00 AM. The case is not reviewable until 11:00 AM. If the SLA starts at 10:00 AM, the case has already consumed 1 hour before it becomes reviewable. The SLA is unachievable. The correct start time is data arrival time, not submission time. The clock starts when the case becomes reviewable, not when it enters the system.

Some cases have business-hours-only SLAs. A case submitted at 6:00 PM with a 4-hour business-hours SLA is due at 10:00 AM the next day, not 10:00 PM the same day. The clock pauses outside business hours. The pause must be explicit in the SLA definition. A business-hours SLA without pause logic becomes a 24-hour SLA in practice. The system must track business hours per timezone and per region. A case submitted in New York follows US Eastern business hours. A case submitted in London follows UK business hours. The clock respects the region.

The SLA clock also pauses during reviewer-initiated waits. A reviewer working a case realizes they need input from a domain expert. They mark the case as waiting-for-input and move to the next case. The SLA clock pauses. The domain expert provides input 2 hours later. The SLA clock resumes. The wait time is not charged against the SLA. The pause prevents SLA misses due to legitimate dependencies. It also prevents abuse. A reviewer who marks every case as waiting-for-input to pause the clock is flagged. The pattern is reviewed. Excessive use of pause is either a training issue or a capacity issue.

## SLA Breach Alerting

Alerting on SLA breach after the fact is reporting, not enforcement. The case is already late. The damage is done. SLA enforcement requires alerting before breach. The system alerts when a case reaches 75 percent of its SLA without completion. A case with a 4-hour SLA alerts at 3 hours. The alert goes to the reviewer, the reviewer's manager, and the operations dashboard. The alert says: this case is approaching SLA breach, intervene now.

The alert must be specific. It must identify the case, the SLA deadline, the time remaining, and the current state. The reviewer assigned to the case sees: Case 8472 is due in 42 minutes, currently in review. The manager sees: 3 cases are approaching SLA breach in the next hour. The operations dashboard shows: 12 cases are in the SLA warning zone. The specificity enables action. A generic alert that says "some cases are late" produces no response. A specific alert that names the cases and the deadline produces urgency.

Alerting must also escalate. If a case reaches 90 percent of its SLA without completion, the alert escalates. The reviewer receives a second alert. The manager receives a second alert. A senior reviewer or team lead is now also alerted. The escalation increases visibility and increases the probability of intervention. A case that reaches 100 percent of its SLA without completion escalates again. The case is now breached. The alert goes to leadership. The breach is logged. The cause is investigated.

Alerting must be rate-limited. If 50 cases are approaching SLA breach simultaneously, the system does not send 50 individual alerts to every stakeholder. The alerts are grouped. The manager receives one alert: 50 cases are approaching breach in the next hour. The alert includes a link to the full list. The rate-limiting prevents alert fatigue. A reviewer who receives 20 alerts per hour stops reading alerts. A reviewer who receives 3 high-priority alerts per hour responds to every one.

## Escalation When SLA at Risk

An SLA alert is not a notification. It is a trigger for intervention. When a case is at risk of missing its SLA, the system must enable rapid response. The response options depend on the reason for the delay. If the case is unassigned, the system assigns it immediately to the highest-capacity reviewer. If the case is assigned but not started, the system re-assigns it to a different reviewer. If the case is in progress but moving slowly, the system offers the reviewer the option to request assistance.

Escalation can also mean priority override. A case approaching SLA breach is moved to the top of the reviewer's queue. The reviewer's current case is paused if it is not also approaching breach. The SLA-at-risk case is completed first. The priority override ensures that SLA risk is resolved before it becomes SLA breach. The override is automatic. The reviewer does not decide whether to prioritize. The system enforces the priority.

Escalation can also mean capacity injection. If multiple cases are approaching SLA breach and no individual reviewer has capacity, the system requests additional reviewers. A reviewer who is off-shift but on-call is paged. A reviewer from a different team with overlapping skills is pulled in. A manager who is trained to review steps in. The capacity injection is temporary and targeted. The goal is to resolve the immediate SLA risk, not to work the entire queue. Once the at-risk cases are completed, the additional capacity returns to their normal role.

Escalation must be logged. Every escalation event is recorded: which case, why it escalated, who intervened, and what the outcome was. The log enables pattern analysis. If the same reviewer's cases escalate repeatedly, the reviewer needs training or capacity adjustment. If the same case type escalates repeatedly, the SLA for that case type is unachievable and must be renegotiated. If escalation is rare, the SLA is achievable and the escalation process is working. The log turns escalation from reactive fire-fighting into a data source for system improvement.

## The Override vs Miss Tradeoff

Sometimes an SLA cannot be met without compromising quality. A complex case with a 4-hour SLA requires 6 hours of careful analysis. The reviewer has three options: miss the SLA, rush the review and risk errors, or request an SLA override. The override extends the SLA for the specific case. The extension is not automatic. It requires approval. The approval is granted when the extension is justified: the case is more complex than expected, the reviewer encountered a blocker, or the quality risk of rushing exceeds the cost of missing the SLA.

The override is logged and tracked. Frequent overrides for the same case type indicate that the SLA is miscalibrated. Frequent overrides from the same reviewer indicate a training or capacity issue. Frequent override approvals from the same manager indicate lenient enforcement. The data surfaces patterns. The patterns drive corrective action. A case type with 40 percent override rate needs a longer SLA or simpler review criteria. A reviewer with 30 percent override rate needs coaching or reassignment.

The override must be time-limited. An override extends the SLA by a fixed amount: 2 hours, 1 day. The extension is not open-ended. The case is not moved to a "no SLA" state. It retains an SLA, just a later one. The extended SLA is tracked separately. A case that meets its extended SLA is marked as override-met, not on-time. A case that misses its extended SLA is marked as override-breach, not standard breach. The distinction matters for reporting and accountability.

Not every case is eligible for override. Urgent cases cannot be overridden. The definition of urgent includes SLA non-negotiability. A customer-blocking case with a 15-minute SLA must be completed in 15 minutes or marked as a miss. The miss has consequences: incident review, root cause analysis, corrective action. The inability to override urgent cases enforces their urgency. If overrides were allowed, urgent would degrade into standard-but-faster.

## SLA Reporting and Accountability

SLA performance is reported at multiple levels. The system-level report shows overall SLA compliance: 94 percent of cases met their SLA this week. The report is broken down by tier: urgent at 98 percent, standard at 92 percent, low-priority at 89 percent. The breakdown surfaces which tiers are healthy and which are struggling. A drop in urgent compliance is a crisis. A drop in low-priority compliance is a capacity allocation question.

The team-level report shows SLA compliance per review team. Team A is at 96 percent. Team B is at 88 percent. The difference prompts investigation. Is Team B handling harder cases? Is Team B understaffed? Is Team B poorly managed? The report does not answer the question, but it asks it. The investigation determines the root cause. The root cause determines the corrective action.

The individual-level report shows SLA compliance per reviewer. Reviewer X is at 98 percent. Reviewer Y is at 82 percent. The difference is not always a performance issue. Reviewer Y may be handling the most complex cases. Reviewer Y may be training new team members and sacrificing their own throughput. The report triggers a conversation, not a punishment. The conversation determines whether the difference is acceptable, fixable, or indicative of a deeper issue.

The report must also show near-misses. A case completed at 3 hours and 58 minutes against a 4-hour SLA is technically on-time. It is also a near-miss. Consistent near-misses indicate that the SLA is tight and capacity is maxed out. A team with 30 percent of cases completed in the final 10 percent of their SLA window is operating without buffer. The first disruption will cause breaches. The near-miss data is a leading indicator of future SLA failure. The organization can act before the failure happens.

## Contractual vs Operational SLAs

Some SLAs are contractual: the organization has legally committed to them. Missing a contractual SLA has financial consequences. Penalties are paid. Contracts are breached. Trust is damaged. Other SLAs are operational: the organization has committed internally but not contractually. Missing an operational SLA has internal consequences but not external penalties. The distinction matters for prioritization.

Contractual SLAs are enforced absolutely. A contractual 2-hour SLA is non-negotiable. The system prioritizes contractual SLA cases above all others. Capacity is allocated to ensure contractual compliance. If operational SLA cases must be delayed to protect contractual SLA cases, they are delayed. The priority is clear. The enforcement is non-negotiable.

Operational SLAs are enforced relative to capacity. The organization makes a best effort to meet operational SLAs, but they yield to contractual SLAs and to capacity limits. An operational 4-hour SLA that is missed due to surge volume is logged, analyzed, and explained. It is not a breach of trust. It is a capacity event. The distinction allows the organization to set aspirational operational SLAs without risking contractual failure.

The system must distinguish between contractual and operational SLAs in routing and prioritization. A contractual case and an operational case with the same SLA do not have equal priority. The contractual case is routed first. The contractual case escalates faster. The contractual case receives surge capacity before the operational case. The distinction is visible in the queue. A reviewer sees which cases are contractual and understands that those cases are protected.

## The SLA Gaming Problem

SLA enforcement creates incentives. Some of those incentives are perverse. A reviewer who is measured on SLA compliance has an incentive to cherry-pick easy cases and avoid hard cases. A reviewer who is measured on throughput has an incentive to rush cases to completion. A manager who is measured on team SLA compliance has an incentive to reject complex cases or route them to other teams. The measurement system creates the gaming behavior. The enforcement system must counteract it.

Cherry-picking is countered by assignment control. The reviewer does not choose which case to work next. The system assigns the case. The assignment is based on SLA urgency, reviewer capacity, and skill match. The reviewer cannot skip a case because it is hard. The case is assigned. The reviewer works it. If the reviewer repeatedly requests reassignment for difficult cases, the pattern is flagged and reviewed.

Rushing is countered by quality monitoring. SLA compliance is measured alongside accuracy. A reviewer at 98 percent SLA compliance and 75 percent accuracy is failing. The accuracy floor is enforced. A reviewer below the accuracy threshold is removed from the queue until they are retrained. SLA performance without quality is not performance. It is waste.

Case rejection is countered by escalation logging. A manager who rejects 20 percent of submitted cases as "out of scope" is flagged. The rejected cases are reviewed. If the rejections are legitimate, the upstream submission criteria need tightening. If the rejections are gaming, the manager is held accountable. Rejection is a legitimate tool for managing inappropriate submissions. It is not a tool for managing difficult work.

Your SLA enforcement determines whether service level agreements are real constraints or aspirational suggestions, whether breaches are prevented or merely reported, and whether accountability is clear or invisible. The review queue infrastructure you build determines whether human judgment is scalable, sustainable, and trusted. Next, we examine prioritization models, and how to ensure that the most important work is completed first.
