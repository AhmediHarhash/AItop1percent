# Chapter 9 — Privacy, PII, and Data Security

AI datasets contain personally identifiable information more often than teams realize. A customer service dataset contains chat histories with names, email addresses, and account details. A healthcare dataset contains patient IDs, diagnoses, and treatment notes. An HR dataset contains performance reviews with names, salaries, and sensitive personnel information. A single leaked dataset can trigger regulatory action, lawsuits, permanent reputational damage, and loss of customer trust that takes years to rebuild.

This chapter provides the operational framework for protecting datasets from collection through retirement. You will learn to detect PII at scale, understand the difference between anonymization and pseudonymization, and implement the consent management workflows that GDPR requires. You will review the data residency rules that apply to your industry, understand healthcare-specific obligations under HIPAA, and implement encryption and secret scanning that catch leaked credentials before they reach production. This chapter also covers what to do when a breach happens: the incident response procedures, stakeholder notification protocols, and the audit trails that regulators will demand to see.
