# Chapter 10 — Dataset Documentation and Governance

A dataset without documentation is a liability. You cannot audit it, cannot share it with other teams, and cannot safely deprecate it without knowing what systems depend on it. Teams treat documentation as a tax, a checkbox to satisfy compliance, when in fact documentation is infrastructure. Governance is not bureaucracy. It is the infrastructure that lets organizations manage dozens or hundreds of datasets without losing track of what they have, who owns it, and whether it is still fit for purpose. Governance also prevents the duplication, redundancy, and conflicting versions of truth that plague larger organizations.

This chapter builds the governance architecture your organization needs at any scale, from a ten-person team to a thousand-person enterprise. You will learn what to document in dataset cards and the specification templates that make documentation systematic rather than ad hoc. You will understand the governance structures that work: review boards, approval workflows, and the decision frameworks that determine when a dataset is ready for use. You will implement deprecation policies that allow old datasets to retire cleanly, discover and reuse existing datasets through internal marketplaces, and establish the continuous governance rhythm that keeps large catalogs healthy. By the end of this chapter, you will have a playbook for governance at scale.
