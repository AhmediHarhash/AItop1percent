# 9.1 — PII in AI Datasets: The Landscape in 2026

In March 2025, a healthcare technology company discovered that their patient support chatbot had memorized and could regurgitate partial medical record numbers and patient names from its training data. The discovery came not from internal audit but from a security researcher who demonstrated the extraction attack on Twitter. Within four days, the company faced inquiries from three state attorneys general, a class action lawsuit representing 140,000 patients, and a formal GDPR investigation from Ireland's Data Protection Commission. The initial fine estimate: 47 million euros. The reputational damage: incalculable. The root cause was not a database breach or a stolen laptop. It was training data that no one had properly scrubbed for personally identifiable information before feeding it into a large language model.

The company's engineering team had treated PII detection as a database problem. They ran standard SQL queries looking for fields labeled "SSN" or "email" in structured tables. They passed HIPAA audits because their database access controls were tight. But the training dataset for the chatbot included two years of unstructured support ticket transcripts, anonymized patient forum posts, and clinical note snippets that domain experts had manually labeled for intent classification. Those transcripts contained fragments: "my daughter Sarah was born on June 3rd and her MRN is..." and "I live at the corner of Maple and Fifth in apartment 2B..." The structured PII was removed. The unstructured PII was embedded in prose that humans wrote naturally, and the detection tooling never flagged it because it was not in a column called "address."

This is the PII problem in AI systems. It is not the PII problem you learned to solve in database administration or web application security. It is harder to find, harder to remove, and vastly more dangerous when it escapes.

## What PII Means in the AI Context

Traditional PII definitions come from regulatory frameworks written before large language models existed. GDPR Article 4 defines personal data as anything that identifies or makes identifiable a natural person. HIPAA defines protected health information as individually identifiable health data. These definitions assume that PII lives in structured fields that you can enumerate, audit, and delete row by row. In AI systems, PII does not live in rows. It lives in text fragments scattered across millions of training examples. It lives in the latent representations learned by models during training. It lives in the activations of neural networks that have compressed your entire dataset into billions of floating point numbers.

When a language model is trained on text containing PII, that information does not stay neatly compartmentalized. The model learns statistical associations between names, addresses, email patterns, phone formats, medical terminology, and the contexts in which they appear. Under certain conditions, the model can reproduce fragments of that training data verbatim. This is not a bug. This is memorization, a well-documented phenomenon in large models trained on repeated or unusual examples. A model trained on customer support emails will memorize the email addresses and case numbers that appear dozens of times. A model trained on medical notes will memorize the rare disease names, drug combinations, and patient identifiers that appear in distinctive patterns.

The attack surface is not limited to prompting the model to repeat training data. Membership inference attacks can determine whether a specific record was in the training set by analyzing the model's confidence on that example. Embedding inversion attacks can reconstruct input text from the vector representations that models produce. Training data extraction attacks, demonstrated rigorously by Carlini and colleagues in 2020 and refined continuously since, can pull verbatim training samples from models by carefully probing with adversarial prompts. The 2026 reality is that any large model trained on data containing PII is a potential PII disclosure risk, and the adversaries probing these models are not theoretical researchers. They are penetration testers, journalists, plaintiffs' attorneys, and hostile actors.

## The 2026 Regulatory Landscape

You are building AI systems in an environment of global regulatory fragmentation with enforcement that is active and punitive. GDPR has been enforced since 2018, but enforcement intensity increased sharply in 2024 and 2025 as regulators developed AI-specific guidance and case law accumulated. The EU AI Act came into force in August 2024 with phased obligations. As of February 2026, high-risk AI systems including those used in employment, credit decisions, and essential services face mandatory data governance requirements, including explicit obligations to minimize personal data processing and implement technical safeguards against PII leakage.

In the United States, there is no federal comprehensive privacy law, but state-level legislation has created a compliance patchwork. California's CPRA, Virginia's CDPA, Colorado's CPA, Connecticut's CTDPA, and Utah's UCPA all impose requirements on automated decision-making systems. Illinois's Biometric Information Privacy Act has generated hundreds of class action lawsuits. New York, Texas, and Florida enacted AI-specific transparency and data governance rules in 2025. If your AI system processes data from US residents, you are navigating at least nine different state regimes with conflicting definitions of personal information, different consent requirements, and different private rights of action.

Globally, China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law impose strict localization and security requirements. Brazil's LGPD mirrors GDPR structure but with Brazilian enforcement priorities. India, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea all have active privacy regulators with AI-specific guidance. The cost of noncompliance is not abstract. GDPR fines can reach four percent of global annual revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is higher. State attorney general actions in the US can result in millions in penalties plus injunctive relief that forces you to rebuild your entire data pipeline. Class action lawsuits create uncapped exposure. A single PII leakage incident can trigger enforcement in a dozen jurisdictions simultaneously.

## Why PII in AI Datasets Is Harder to Find Than in Databases

Database PII lives in schemas you control. You know which tables contain customer names, which columns contain Social Security numbers, which fields are marked sensitive in your data dictionary. You can write a query that lists every row containing PII. You can enforce access controls at the column level. You can delete records and confirm deletion with a row count. None of this is true for unstructured training data.

AI training datasets are aggregations from heterogeneous sources: application logs, customer support tickets, user-generated content, third-party datasets, scraped web data, annotated corpora purchased from vendors, internal knowledge bases, and edge case collections maintained by engineers. Each source has different structure, different conventions, different levels of curation. A customer support ticket might contain an email address in the "from" field, the same email address repeated in the ticket body, a phone number in the signature block, a shipping address in the conversation, and an account number in the subject line. None of these fields are labeled "PII" in your dataset. They are all plain text.

Unstructured text is where humans naturally embed identifying information without thinking about it. Support agents write "I spoke with Jane Doe at 555-1234 and confirmed her address is 742 Evergreen Terrace." Product reviews include "I ordered this on my account jdoe at example dot com and it arrived damaged." Forum posts say "I'm a 34-year-old male software engineer living in Austin, Texas, working at a Series B startup." Every one of these sentences contains PII. None of it is in a field you can easily query. All of it gets tokenized and fed into your training pipeline unless you catch it first.

The volume problem compounds the detection problem. A database might have ten million customer records in a structured table. You can scan ten million rows quickly. A training dataset for a production language model might have fifty billion tokens of text drawn from hundreds of millions of documents. Scanning that volume for PII requires running detection algorithms across the entire corpus, which means compute cost, latency, and the certainty that your detection will miss edge cases.

## The Attack Surface: How PII Leaks from Models

The Samsung ChatGPT incident in April 2023 was a watershed moment for enterprise awareness of PII risk in AI. Samsung engineers pasted proprietary source code and internal meeting notes into ChatGPT to get help with debugging and summarization. That data became part of OpenAI's training data under the terms of service at the time. Samsung banned ChatGPT use company-wide within days. The incident was not a hack. It was employees using a tool as designed, not realizing that their inputs were training data for a model that other users could potentially extract.

Training data extraction attacks work by exploiting memorization. When a model is trained on data that appears multiple times or in distinctive patterns, the model learns to reproduce that data. Attackers craft prompts designed to trigger memorization: asking for completions that start with partial PII, asking the model to repeat random strings that might appear in training data, or asking for examples of text matching certain patterns. Carlini's 2020 paper demonstrated extraction of names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses from GPT-2. Subsequent work showed extraction from larger models including GPT-3 and open-source models trained on web scrapes. The defenses deployed by major model providers in 2024 and 2025 reduced but did not eliminate extraction risk.

Membership inference attacks determine whether a specific example was in the training set by measuring the model's likelihood score on that example compared to a reference distribution. If a model assigns unusually high probability to a particular email address or medical record, that is evidence the model saw that data during training. Privacy researchers have used membership inference to detect presence of specific individuals' data in training sets for image models, language models, and recommendation systems. The attack does not extract the data directly, but it confirms exposure, which is enough to establish liability in many regulatory contexts.

Embedding inversion attacks target the vector representations that models create from text inputs. Modern language models produce dense embeddings: vectors of 768, 1024, or 4096 floating point numbers that encode semantic meaning. Researchers have shown that with access to embeddings and knowledge of the model architecture, attackers can partially reconstruct the original input text, including PII that the text contained. If your system exposes embeddings through an API or stores them in a vector database with weak access controls, you have created an additional leakage path.

## The Cost of Getting This Wrong

The financial cost is the most measurable but not the most damaging consequence. GDPR fines for PII leakage incidents in 2024 and 2025 ranged from hundreds of thousands of euros for small-scale violations to tens of millions for systemic failures. The Italian Data Protection Authority fined OpenAI 15 million euros in March 2024 for inadequate data governance related to ChatGPT training data. The Irish DPC issued a 35 million euro fine against a health tech company in November 2025 for failure to implement adequate PII controls in an AI diagnostic tool. These fines are backward-looking: they punish past violations. The forward-looking cost is the consent decree or regulatory order that forces you to rebuild your entire data pipeline, retrain your models from scratch, and submit to ongoing monitoring for three to five years.

Class action lawsuits in the United States create uncapped financial exposure. Statutory damages under BIPA in Illinois are one thousand dollars per negligent violation and five thousand dollars per reckless or intentional violation. If your model was trained on biometric data from 100,000 individuals without proper consent, the potential exposure is 500 million dollars before you even get to discovery. Plaintiffs' attorneys are actively scanning for AI PII cases because the damages are clear, the violations are often well-documented in public model cards or academic papers, and the defendants have deep pockets.

The reputational cost is slower but more permanent. Healthcare companies that leak patient PII lose contracts with hospital systems and payer networks. Financial services companies that expose customer data lose enterprise clients and face heightened scrutiny from regulators on all future products. Consumer-facing companies see user churn, negative press cycles, and brand damage that persists for years. The trust cost is unquantifiable but real: once users learn that your AI system leaked their data, they will not give you the benefit of the doubt again.

The operational cost is the emergency response. When a PII leak is discovered or alleged, you enter crisis mode. Engineering freezes feature work to audit the dataset. Legal brings in outside counsel. Communications handles press inquiries. Product pulls the affected feature or model. Executives field questions from the board and investors. You will spend weeks or months reconstructing how the PII entered the dataset, where it might have propagated, which models might be affected, and which users might be impacted. You will re-contact users, offer credit monitoring, file regulatory breach notifications, and prepare for litigation. The team that built the product will be pulled into depositions, regulatory interviews, and incident post-mortems. The opportunity cost of this response is measured in quarters of lost velocity.

## The Embedding Leakage Problem

Even if your model does not regurgitate training data verbatim, embeddings create a secondary exposure risk. Many production AI systems expose embeddings as part of their API: semantic search tools return embedding vectors, RAG systems store document embeddings in vector databases, recommendation engines compute user and item embeddings. If those embeddings are derived from inputs containing PII, the PII is encoded in the vector representation.

Embeddings are not encrypted. They are not hashed. They are compressed representations optimized for similarity search, not for privacy. An embedding of the text "Patient John Doe born March 15 1978 diagnosed with hypertension" contains information about that patient encoded in 1024 floating point numbers. With knowledge of the embedding model, an attacker can probe the vector space to partially reconstruct the input. With access to a corpus of embeddings, an attacker can cluster similar vectors and infer demographic or sensitive attributes even without reconstructing exact text.

The vector database problem compounds this. Production systems store millions of embeddings in Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or Chroma for retrieval-augmented generation. Those databases are optimized for speed and scale, not for access control at the vector level. If an attacker gains access to your vector database through misconfigured cloud permissions, SQL injection, or insider threat, they have access to embeddings representing your entire knowledge base, including any PII that was embedded in source documents. The exfiltration is silent: vector databases do not log which embeddings were read the way transactional databases log row access.

## What AI-Specific PII Governance Requires

Traditional data governance is necessary but not sufficient. You still need database encryption, access control, audit logging, and retention policies. But AI-specific PII governance requires controls at every stage of the dataset lifecycle: ingestion, labeling, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

At ingestion, you must scan for PII before data enters your training pipeline. This is not optional. It is not a nice-to-have audit step. It is the gate that prevents contaminated data from propagating into models that will be expensive or impossible to retrain. At labeling, you must ensure that human annotators do not introduce PII in comments, corrections, or freetext fields. At training, you must implement differential privacy techniques, memorization audits, and data partitioning that limits exposure. At evaluation, your test sets must be PII-free or synthetically generated to avoid leakage through error analysis. At deployment, you must monitor for extraction attempts and embedding leakage. At every stage, you must be able to answer the question: if this data leaks, who is harmed, how badly, and what is our liability?

The dataset engineering practices in the following subchapters are not theoretical best practices for an ideal future state. They are the baseline controls that regulators, plaintiffs' attorneys, and security researchers expect you to have implemented in February 2026. The adversaries are already probing. The fines are already being written. The lawsuits are already being filed. The question is whether your dataset governance can withstand scrutiny when the incident happens, not if.

The first layer of defense is detection: building automated systems to find PII before it contaminates your training data.
