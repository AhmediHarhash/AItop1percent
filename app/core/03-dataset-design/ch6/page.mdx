# Chapter 6 — Evaluation Dataset Construction

Your evaluation dataset defines what "good" means in practice. When you measure your model's performance, you are measuring it against your eval set. If that eval set is poorly designed, contaminated, or unrepresentative, your metrics are fiction. Teams ship regressions because their eval sets are too small or strategically biased. Teams maintain false confidence because they never tested edge cases or rare user patterns. Teams waste months chasing improvements on the wrong dimensions because their eval set did not measure what users actually care about.

This chapter covers eval set design principles (coverage, balance, and difficulty tiering), sizing for statistical power, stratified sampling, golden sets, contamination prevention, split strategies that block leakage, and the process for evolving eval sets as your product changes. We also cover adversarial eval sets that stress-test edge cases, multi-dimensional eval sets that test multiple criteria simultaneously, and the cross-functional review process that catches blind spots. Finally, we address the painful task of debugging when your eval set itself is wrong—when metrics improve but users complain.

An eval set is an investment that pays dividends for years. A well-designed eval set tells you the truth. A poorly designed eval set tells you what you want to hear. The difference determines whether your team ships regressions or ships confidence.

*We begin with the fundamental question: what separates an eval set that tells you the truth from one that tells you what you want to hear?*
