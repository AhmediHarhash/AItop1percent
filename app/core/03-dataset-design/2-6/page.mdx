# 2.6 — Web Scraping and Crawling in 2026: Legal, Ethical, and Technical Realities

In early 2025, a European startup building a real estate pricing model scraped property listings from 200 websites across 15 countries to assemble a training dataset of 12 million listings. The model performed well in testing, achieving mean absolute error within 6% on held-out data. The company raised $8 million in seed funding and began pilots with three real estate platforms. Four months later, they received cease and desist letters from 47 of the scraped websites alleging terms of service violations, trespass to chattels, and copyright infringement. Two of the letters came from companies in France and Germany that explicitly cited the EU AI Act's training data transparency requirements, demanding full disclosure of what data was scraped, when, and how it was used. The startup's legal counsel determined that defending the claims would cost more than the company's remaining runway, and that even if they prevailed, compliance with emerging EU regulations would require re-engineering the entire dataset with licensed data. The company attempted to pivot to using real estate APIs and data partnerships, but the model's performance degraded significantly because API data covered only a fraction of the listings and lacked the pricing diversity the scraper had captured. By November 2025, the company shut down. The founders had assumed that web scraping was a standard, low-risk practice because it had worked for previous generations of ML companies. They failed to recognize that the legal, ethical, and regulatory landscape had shifted fundamentally between 2023 and 2025.

This failure illustrates the new reality of web scraping for AI training data in 2026. What was once a widely accepted gray area has become a legal minefield. Terms of service enforcement has intensified, copyright litigation has proliferated, regulatory frameworks now impose transparency and provenance obligations, and public sentiment has turned sharply against unconsented data harvesting. Web scraping is not dead, but it is no longer the easy default. You must navigate a complex decision tree of legal risk, ethical responsibility, technical capability, and business sustainability. For many use cases, licensed data, partnerships, or synthetic data have become safer and more viable alternatives.

## The Legal Landscape: From Gray Area to Red Flags

Web scraping exists in a legal gray area in most jurisdictions, but that gray area has darkened considerably. In the United States, courts have issued conflicting rulings on whether scraping publicly accessible web data violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The 2022 hiQ Labs versus LinkedIn case established that scraping publicly available data does not necessarily constitute unauthorized access, but subsequent cases have muddied the waters. Terms of service that explicitly prohibit scraping have been upheld in some contexts, creating contractual liability even when no statute is directly violated. The risk is not that scraping is clearly illegal, but that it is unclear enough to invite litigation, and litigation is expensive regardless of outcome.

In Europe, the situation is more restrictive. The General Data Protection Regulation applies to any processing of personal data, and scraping websites that display personal information such as names, email addresses, or user-generated content triggers GDPR obligations. You must have a lawful basis for processing, typically consent or legitimate interest, and legitimate interest is a weak foundation when the data subjects have no relationship with you and no knowledge that you are collecting their data. The GDPR's transparency requirements mean you must inform data subjects about the processing, but scraping inherently operates without such notice. Many European data protection authorities have signaled that large-scale scraping for commercial purposes does not meet GDPR standards, and several high-profile enforcement actions in 2024 and 2025 have targeted companies that scraped social media or business directories.

The EU AI Act, which entered full enforcement in 2025, adds another layer. Article 53 requires providers of general-purpose AI models to publish detailed summaries of the training data, including sources, curation methods, and data provenance. If you scrape data from thousands of websites without permission, documenting that scraping in a transparency report exposes you to legal claims from those websites and creates a public record of potential violations. The transparency obligation forces you to choose between compliance, which reveals your practices and invites lawsuits, and non-compliance, which risks regulatory penalties. Many AI companies have responded by shifting to licensed datasets or data partnerships that provide clear legal provenance and contractual rights to use the data for training.

Copyright law has also become a major concern. In 2024 and 2025, multiple lawsuits were filed against AI companies alleging that scraping copyrighted content for training constitutes infringement. The legal theory is that training a model on copyrighted works creates derivative works or unauthorized reproductions, even if the model does not output exact copies. These cases are still working through courts, and the outcomes remain uncertain, but the mere existence of the litigation has changed the risk calculus. Investors and executives are increasingly unwilling to build businesses on datasets that could be subject to billion-dollar copyright claims. The safe harbor is to use data that you have licensed, that is explicitly labeled for AI training, or that is in the public domain.

## Jurisdictional Complexity

The legal risks vary dramatically by jurisdiction, creating complexity for companies operating globally. What is permissible in one country may be prohibited in another. A scraping strategy that works in the United States might violate GDPR in Europe, data localization laws in China, or privacy regulations in California. You cannot apply a one-size-fits-all approach.

This complexity compounds when data crosses borders. If you scrape data in Europe and transfer it to the United States for processing, you trigger GDPR's data transfer requirements. You need mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions to legitimize the transfer. If you scrape data about EU citizens from a US-based website, GDPR still applies because the regulation follows the data subjects, not the website's location.

Many companies respond by implementing region-specific scraping policies. They scrape more conservatively in high-risk jurisdictions like the EU and UK, focusing on licensed data or public domain sources. They scrape more aggressively in jurisdictions with weaker enforcement, accepting higher risk in exchange for data access. This fragmentation increases operational complexity and creates inconsistencies in dataset quality across regions.

Legal review becomes essential for any scraping program targeting multiple jurisdictions. You need counsel familiar with data protection law, copyright law, and contract law in each target jurisdiction. The cost of this legal review often exceeds the cost of simply licensing data, making scraping economically unattractive for risk-averse organizations.

## Terms of Service and Robots.txt: Not Just Suggestions

Most websites publish terms of service that prohibit automated scraping, and most include a robots.txt file that specifies which parts of the site should not be crawled. Historically, many scraper operators ignored these signals, reasoning that they were unenforceable, difficult to detect, or only sporadically enforced. That reasoning no longer holds. Websites have become more aggressive about detecting and blocking scrapers, and they have become more willing to pursue legal action against violators.

Terms of service violations can create contractual liability if the scraper created an account or otherwise agreed to the terms. Even without explicit agreement, some courts have found that continued use of a website after being notified of terms that prohibit scraping constitutes acceptance. The hiQ versus LinkedIn case established that scraping public data does not violate the CFAA, but it did not immunize scraping from terms of service enforcement under contract or state law theories. If a website sends you a cease and desist letter and you continue scraping, you are on much weaker legal ground.

Robots.txt is a technical standard, not a legal requirement, but disregarding it can be used as evidence of bad faith or unauthorized access. Courts have considered robots.txt compliance when evaluating whether a scraper exceeded authorized access. More importantly, ignoring robots.txt is an ethical signal. You are asserting that your interest in the data outweighs the website operator's explicit request not to access it. This stance is harder to defend publicly, especially in a climate where data ethics and consent are under intense scrutiny.

The practical implication is that you cannot casually scrape websites and hope nobody notices or cares. You must evaluate each source for terms of service restrictions, check robots.txt compliance, and assess the risk that the website operator will detect your scraping and respond legally or technically. For high-value targets like major social media platforms, news publishers, or e-commerce sites, the risk is substantial. These operators have legal teams, sophisticated bot detection, and strong incentives to protect their data from competitors and AI companies. For smaller, niche websites, the risk may be lower, but it is never zero.

## Ethical Considerations: Consent, Attribution, and Harm

Beyond legal risk, scraping raises ethical questions that you must address even if the law permits your activity. The first is consent. When you scrape a website, you are collecting data that users or website operators published for a specific purpose, such as sharing information with other users or attracting customers, and you are repurposing it for AI training without asking permission. The users whose content you scrape did not consent to this use, and in many cases have no knowledge it is happening. This lack of consent is ethically problematic, especially when the data is personal, sensitive, or user-generated.

The second ethical concern is attribution and compensation. If you scrape creative works, product reviews, forum discussions, or other user-generated content, you are extracting value created by others and using it to build a commercial product without attributing the creators or compensating them. The original creators receive no benefit and may even be harmed if your AI system competes with their work or replaces the need to visit their website. This dynamic has fueled much of the backlash against large language models and generative AI, which are seen as exploiting creators without fair compensation.

The third concern is harm to the source website. Aggressive scraping can impose significant server load, increase infrastructure costs, and degrade the experience for legitimate users. Even if you rate-limit your requests to avoid overwhelming the server, you are still consuming resources that the website operator must pay for. If your scraping is detected and blocked, you may engage in an arms race of evasion techniques, rotating IPs, and CAPTCHA solving, all of which further strain the relationship and escalate resource consumption.

These ethical concerns cannot be dismissed as soft considerations separate from business risk. In 2026, ethics and reputation are business-critical. Public backlash against unethical data practices can damage your brand, deter partnerships, alienate customers, and attract regulatory scrutiny. Investors increasingly ask about data provenance and ethical sourcing during due diligence. Enterprises evaluating your AI product want assurances that the training data was obtained legally and ethically, because they do not want to inherit your liability or reputational risk. Ethical data sourcing is not just the right thing to do, it is a competitive advantage and a risk mitigation strategy.

## The Creator Economy Backlash

The backlash from creators against unauthorized data harvesting has intensified in 2025 and 2026. Artists, writers, photographers, and other content creators increasingly view AI training as theft of their intellectual property. High-profile creators have organized boycotts, launched class-action lawsuits, and lobbied for stronger copyright protections. Some platforms now offer opt-out mechanisms that allow creators to exclude their content from AI training, fragmenting the data landscape.

This creator backlash affects not only the legal risks of scraping but also its social license. Even if scraping is technically legal, it may be socially unacceptable. Companies perceived as exploiting creators face brand damage, customer boycotts, and employee dissent. Tech workers increasingly refuse to work on projects that harvest data without consent. Investors worry about reputational risk and regulatory backlash.

The response from leading AI companies has been to negotiate licensing deals with creator platforms, publishers, and rights holders. These deals provide legal clarity, ethical legitimacy, and stable data access. They also signal to the market that the company respects intellectual property and compensates creators fairly. The cost of licensing is significant, but the cost of reputational damage from scraping without permission can be far higher.

Some companies attempt to split the difference by scraping only public domain content or content with permissive licenses. This approach reduces legal and ethical risk but limits data availability. Public domain content is often historical and may not reflect current language, culture, or knowledge. Permissively licensed content, such as Creative Commons material, represents a small fraction of the web and may not cover the domains or use cases you need.

## Technical Challenges: Detection, Blocking, and Arms Races

Even when scraping is legally and ethically defensible, the technical challenges have grown significantly. Websites have invested heavily in bot detection and anti-scraping technologies. Simple techniques like checking user agents or rate-limiting requests are now augmented with behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, CAPTCHA challenges, and commercial bot detection services that use machine learning to distinguish human users from automated scrapers. These defenses are effective, and circumventing them requires substantial engineering effort.

The first layer of defense is rate limiting and IP blocking. If your scraper sends requests too quickly or from too few IP addresses, it will be flagged and blocked. To evade this, you need to distribute requests across many IPs, use residential proxies, randomize request timing, and mimic human browsing patterns. This infrastructure is expensive and operationally complex. Proxy services charge based on bandwidth and request volume, and residential proxies, which are harder to detect, cost significantly more than datacenter IPs. At scale, the cost of proxies can exceed the cost of licensed data.

The second layer is CAPTCHA and JavaScript challenges. Many websites require users to solve CAPTCHAs or execute JavaScript to prove they are human. Automated CAPTCHA solving services exist, but they add latency, cost, and further ethical concerns about exploiting human labor. JavaScript execution requires running a headless browser instead of a simple HTTP client, which increases resource consumption and slows down scraping. Headless browsers are also easier to fingerprint and detect through techniques like Canvas fingerprinting, WebGL analysis, and behavioral telemetry.

The third layer is legal and contractual enforcement. If a website detects your scraping despite your evasion techniques, it may send a cease and desist letter, block your IP ranges permanently, or pursue legal action. At that point, you must decide whether to stop, negotiate a licensing agreement, or continue scraping and accept the legal risk. Continuing typically means escalating the technical arms race, which is resource-intensive and fragile. Your scraper may work today and break tomorrow when the website updates its defenses.

The operational burden of maintaining scrapers is also significant. Websites change their HTML structure, URL schemes, and page layouts frequently. Each change can break your parsing logic, requiring constant monitoring and updates. If you scrape hundreds or thousands of sites, this maintenance becomes a full-time engineering task. The fragility and maintenance overhead make scraping a poor long-term foundation for critical datasets unless you have dedicated infrastructure and engineering resources.

## Bot Detection Evolution

Bot detection has become a sophisticated industry. Services like Cloudflare, Akamai, and PerimeterX use machine learning models trained on billions of requests to identify automated traffic. They analyze request patterns, timing, headers, cookies, and even mouse movements and keystroke dynamics to distinguish bots from humans. These systems detect not just simple scrapers but also advanced evasion techniques like headless browsers and human-assisted scraping.

The detection models adapt continuously. When scrapers find a new evasion technique, bot detection services update their models to detect it. This creates a perpetual arms race where scrapers invest engineering effort to stay ahead of detection, and detection services invest to close the gaps. The scrapers that survive are those with dedicated teams and budgets that can sustain this ongoing battle.

Some websites implement honeypot techniques, embedding invisible links or data that only bots would access. If your scraper follows these honeypots, it reveals itself as automated and gets blocked. Other sites use challenge-response protocols that require solving puzzles or interacting with dynamic page elements, operations that are trivial for humans but expensive for bots.

The net result is that scraping is no longer a weekend project or a one-time script. It is an ongoing engineering commitment that requires infrastructure, expertise, and budget. For many use cases, this commitment is not justified when licensed data or APIs provide the same information with less friction and risk.

## When Scraping Is Still Viable: The Narrow Use Cases

Despite the legal, ethical, and technical headwinds, web scraping remains viable for certain narrow use cases. The first is scraping websites that explicitly permit it, either through permissive terms of service, public APIs, or open data licenses. Many government websites, academic repositories, and open-source communities publish data with the intent that it be reused. Scraping this data is low-risk and ethically sound, though you should still respect robots.txt, rate limits, and any attribution requirements.

The second viable use case is scraping for non-commercial research purposes under fair use or academic exemptions. If you are building a dataset for a research paper, a public benchmark, or an educational project, the legal and ethical calculus shifts. Fair use may apply, and website operators are less likely to pursue legal action against academic researchers than against commercial AI companies. However, fair use is a defense, not a right, and it must be argued in court if challenged. Even for research, you should seek permission when possible and document your rationale for scraping when permission is not granted.

The third use case is scraping your own data or data you have contractual rights to access. If you operate a platform and want to scrape user-generated content for model training, and your terms of service grant you that right, scraping is legally permissible. You still face ethical obligations to respect user privacy, provide transparency, and allow opt-out, but the legal risk is minimal. Similarly, if you have a partnership or licensing agreement with a website that permits scraping, you can proceed within the bounds of that agreement.

The fourth use case is scraping as a last resort for critical, non-replicable data when licensed alternatives do not exist. If the only way to obtain certain data is to scrape it, and the data is essential to your product's value proposition, you may decide the risk is acceptable. But this should be a conscious, documented decision made with legal counsel, not a default approach. You should evaluate the likelihood of detection, the website operator's enforcement history, the potential legal theories they could pursue, and the cost of litigation relative to your business value. You should also have a mitigation plan, such as switching to licensed data or synthetic data if the scraping becomes untenable.

## Licensed Data and Partnerships: The Safer Path

For most commercial AI applications in 2026, licensed data and data partnerships are the safer and increasingly the only viable path. Licensed datasets are collections that you purchase or subscribe to with explicit legal rights to use the data for AI training. The license agreement specifies what you can do with the data, how long you can use it, and what restrictions apply. This contractual clarity eliminates the legal ambiguity of scraping and provides defensible provenance for regulatory compliance and customer assurances.

Data partnerships involve working directly with websites, platforms, or data providers to access their data through APIs, bulk exports, or custom integrations. In exchange, you may pay licensing fees, provide the partner with access to your model's outputs, share revenue, or offer other business value. Partnerships take longer to negotiate than scraping and require ongoing relationship management, but they provide stable, high-quality data with legal and ethical legitimacy.

The market for licensed AI training data has grown rapidly in 2024 and 2025. Providers now offer datasets across many domains: news articles, social media posts, e-commerce listings, financial data, scientific literature, and more. Some providers aggregate data from multiple sources and handle the licensing negotiations on your behalf. Others operate proprietary platforms and license their user-generated content directly. Pricing models vary, from one-time purchases to subscription-based access to revenue-sharing arrangements.

Licensed data is more expensive than scraping in direct monetary terms, but it avoids the indirect costs of legal risk, technical maintenance, and reputational damage. A licensed dataset may cost tens of thousands or millions of dollars depending on volume and exclusivity, but a single copyright lawsuit can cost more to defend, and a regulatory enforcement action can shut down your product. The total cost of ownership, including risk-adjusted expenses, often favors licensed data over scraping for commercial applications.

Partnerships also provide opportunities for data quality and customization that scraping cannot match. A partner can filter, annotate, or enrich the data according to your specifications. They can provide ongoing updates and ensure data freshness. They can help you comply with privacy regulations by anonymizing or aggregating data before delivery. These value-added services improve your dataset quality and reduce your engineering burden, making the partnership more valuable than raw scraped data.

## Evaluating Data Partnerships

Not all data partnerships are created equal. You must evaluate partners on multiple dimensions before committing. First, assess their legal rights to the data. Do they own the content, or are they reselling data they licensed from someone else? If they are a reseller, do their upstream licenses permit sublicensing for AI training? You need clear chain-of-title documentation to avoid inheriting someone else's legal liability.

Second, evaluate data quality and coverage. Request samples before signing a contract. Verify that the data matches your domain, volume, and freshness requirements. Check for bias, noise, and missing values. Compare the partner's data against alternatives to ensure you are getting competitive quality and pricing.

Third, assess the partner's stability and reliability. Will they still exist in two years, or are they a startup that might shut down or get acquired? What happens to your data access if they change business models or raise prices? Build contract terms that protect your access and give you time to transition if the partnership ends.

Fourth, understand the restrictions and usage rights. Can you use the data for all your intended purposes, or are there limits on model types, deployment scenarios, or customer segments? Can you keep models trained on the data if the partnership ends, or must you retrain from scratch? These terms affect your long-term product strategy and bargaining power.

Finally, consider the partnership's strategic implications. Does working with this partner align with your brand and values? Will the partnership create conflicts with other partners or customers? Does it give the partner insight into your roadmap or competitive positioning that they could exploit? Data partnerships are business relationships, not just technical integrations, and they require strategic evaluation.

## Transparency and Documentation: Compliance and Trust

The EU AI Act's transparency requirements have made data provenance documentation a necessity for any AI system targeting European markets. You must be able to describe where your training data came from, how it was collected, what processing was applied, and what rights you have to use it. If your dataset includes scraped data, you must disclose that, including which websites were scraped and under what justification. This disclosure exposes you to legal claims from those websites and to public criticism from advocates concerned about data ethics.

The alternative is to build datasets with clear, documented provenance from the start. Licensed data comes with agreements that specify usage rights. Partnerships include documentation of data flows and permissions. Synthetic data or internally generated data has no third-party rights issues. Public domain data or data released under permissive licenses like Creative Commons can be used with proper attribution. All of these sources allow you to produce a transparency report that demonstrates compliance and builds trust with users, regulators, and enterprise customers.

Transparency also serves as a forcing function for ethical decision-making. When you know you must publicly disclose your data sources and collection methods, you are incentivized to use methods that can withstand scrutiny. You are less likely to cut corners, scrape without permission, or ignore terms of service. The transparency requirement aligns legal compliance, ethical responsibility, and business reputation, creating a virtuous cycle that improves data practices across the industry.

Documentation should include not only what data you collected, but also what data you considered and rejected. If you evaluated scraping a website and decided against it due to legal risk or ethical concerns, document that decision. If you negotiated a partnership and the partner declined, document the attempt. This record demonstrates good faith effort to obtain data responsibly and provides evidence of your risk evaluation process if questions arise later.

## Evolving Standards: What 2026 Norms Demand

The norms around web scraping have shifted faster than the law. In 2022, scraping was common practice, widely used by startups and large tech companies alike, and rarely challenged except by the most aggressive platform operators. By 2026, the norm has reversed. Scraping is now seen as ethically questionable, legally risky, and reputationally damaging. The burden of proof has shifted: you must justify why scraping is necessary and defensible, rather than assuming it is acceptable by default.

This shift reflects broader societal conversations about data ownership, digital consent, and the power dynamics of AI development. Users are more aware that their online activity and content are being harvested for AI training, and they are increasingly opposed to it. Website operators are more protective of their data as they recognize its value and their ability to monetize it through licensing. Regulators are more active in enforcing data protection and transparency rules. Investors and enterprise customers are more risk-averse and demand clean data provenance.

In this environment, best practice is to avoid scraping unless you have explicit permission, a clear legal basis, and a defensible ethical rationale. Prioritize licensed data, partnerships, public datasets, and synthetic data. When scraping is necessary, limit it to the minimum required, respect robots.txt and rate limits, document your justification, and be prepared to stop if challenged. Treat scraping as a temporary expedient while you work toward a sustainable, licensed data strategy, not as a permanent foundation for your dataset.

The industry is moving toward a world where training data is a licensed asset, not a free resource to be extracted. This transition increases the cost of data acquisition but also increases the quality, stability, and legitimacy of datasets. Companies that adapt early by building licensed data pipelines and ethical data practices will have a competitive advantage in regulatory compliance, customer trust, and partnership opportunities. Companies that cling to scraping as a cost-saving shortcut will face escalating legal risk, technical fragility, and reputational damage.

## Practical Decision Framework: To Scrape or Not to Scrape

When evaluating whether to scrape a particular data source, apply a structured decision framework. First, assess necessity. Is this data essential to your product, or is it a nice-to-have? Are there licensed alternatives, public datasets, or synthetic data options that could serve the same purpose? If alternatives exist, use them. Scraping should be a last resort, not a first choice.

Second, assess legal risk. What jurisdiction are you in, and what jurisdiction is the website in? Does the website have terms of service that prohibit scraping? Does robots.txt disallow access? Is the data personal or copyrighted? Have other companies been sued for scraping similar data? Consult with legal counsel, and get a written risk assessment. If the risk is high, do not scrape.

Third, assess ethical implications. Would the website operator and the users whose data you are scraping consent if asked? Are you causing harm or imposing costs on the website? Are you extracting value created by others without compensation? If the ethical case is weak, do not scrape, even if the legal risk is manageable. Ethical missteps create reputational damage and stakeholder backlash that legal compliance cannot prevent.

Fourth, assess technical feasibility and cost. Can you scrape the data reliably at the scale and freshness you need? How much will proxies, CAPTCHA solving, and infrastructure cost? How much engineering time will scraping and maintenance require? Compare the total cost of scraping against the cost of licensed data. Often, licensed data is cheaper when you account for engineering time, infrastructure, and risk.

Fifth, assess sustainability. If the website detects your scraping and sends a cease and desist, can you pivot to an alternative data source without breaking your product? If regulations tighten or licensing markets mature, can you transition to licensed data? If the answer is no, scraping creates an existential dependency that threatens your business continuity. Build a sustainable data strategy from the start.

If all five assessments, necessity, legal risk, ethical implications, technical feasibility, and sustainability, point to scraping being viable, proceed with caution. Implement robust monitoring, rate limiting, and error handling. Document your legal rationale and ethical justification. Plan for the possibility that you will need to stop and transition to licensed data. Treat scraping as a temporary phase in your data pipeline's evolution, not a permanent solution.

## Risk Mitigation for Necessary Scraping

When scraping is unavoidable, implement multiple layers of risk mitigation. First, establish clear rate limits that respect the target website's infrastructure. Monitor your request volume and spacing to ensure you are not overwhelming servers. Use exponential backoff when encountering errors or rate limit responses. This demonstrates good faith and reduces the likelihood of technical retaliation.

Second, implement robust logging and audit trails. Record what data you scraped, when you scraped it, and from which sources. This documentation supports transparency requirements and provides evidence of your practices if challenged. The logs also help you respond to cease and desist letters by quickly identifying what data came from which source and ceasing scraping of specific sites without disrupting your entire pipeline.

Third, build modularity into your data pipeline. Design your system so that you can swap scraped data sources for licensed alternatives without retraining models from scratch. Use abstraction layers that isolate data source dependencies. This modularity reduces your switching costs and makes it feasible to transition away from scraping when better alternatives emerge or when legal pressure mounts.

Fourth, maintain relationships with legal counsel who understand data law, intellectual property, and your specific business context. Do not wait until you receive a cease and desist letter to consult lawyers. Get proactive advice on which scraping activities are defensible and which are high-risk. Budget for legal review as part of your data acquisition costs.

## The Future: Toward Transparent, Licensed Data Ecosystems

The trajectory is clear. The era of free-for-all web scraping is ending. The future is licensed data ecosystems where data providers, AI developers, and regulators operate within clear legal and ethical frameworks. Data will be a paid input to AI development, like compute and engineering talent, and its cost will be factored into business models and pricing. Providers who create valuable datasets will monetize them through licensing. AI companies will compete on model quality, fine-tuning, and application design, not on who can scrape the most data without getting caught.

This shift will professionalize the AI industry. It will reduce the legal uncertainty and reputational risk that currently plague data acquisition. It will create incentives for data quality and curation, as providers compete to offer the best datasets and AI companies demand transparency and provenance. It will align data practices with societal values around consent, attribution, and fairness. And it will enable regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act to function effectively, because compliance will be straightforward when data sources are documented and licensed.

Your role in this transition is to adopt best practices now, before regulation or litigation forces you to. Build relationships with data providers. Budget for licensed data as a core operational expense. Document your data sources transparently. Respect terms of service and robots.txt. Avoid scraping unless absolutely necessary, and when you do scrape, do it ethically and defensibly. By leading the transition rather than resisting it, you position your company for long-term success in a regulated, professionalized AI industry.

Web scraping in 2026 is not what it was in 2022. The legal landscape has hardened, the ethical expectations have risen, the technical defenses have strengthened, and the market for licensed data has matured. Scraping remains possible, but it is no longer easy or safe. Treat it as a high-risk activity requiring careful justification and mitigation, and invest in building sustainable data pipelines based on licensed data, partnerships, and ethical practices. With robust data collection strategies in place, your next challenge is managing the diversity and variability of data sources across different domains and languages, ensuring your pipeline can handle the heterogeneity that real-world data brings.
