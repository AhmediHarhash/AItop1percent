# 2.6 — Label Deprecation: Retiring Labels Safely Without Breaking Evals

Removing a label from the schema without deprecation planning broke three downstream systems in three weeks. The trust and safety dashboard showed a hundred percent drop in spam detection because the panel still queried the deleted label name. The eval pipeline failed because benchmark items included the deprecated label that no longer existed in schema validation. The compliance team could not produce historical enforcement reports because the label definition had been removed entirely, making historical data uninterpretable. Label deprecation is not deletion. It is a multi-phase lifecycle requiring announcement, transition periods, sunset procedures, and permanent archival that preserve historical data interpretability while allowing the taxonomy to evolve. Treating it as a simple remove operation produces cascading failures across every system that depends on those labels for dashboards, evaluation, compliance reporting, or historical analysis.

The first incident happened on November 18th when the trust and safety dashboard showed a sudden 100% drop in spam-commercial detection rates. The dashboard had a dedicated panel tracking spam trends over time, and the panel went blank after November 15th because no new items were receiving the spam-commercial label. The dashboard code threw errors trying to render an empty time series. The team fixed the dashboard by updating it to use the new commercial-abuse label, but the fix broke trend continuity. The chart now showed a discontinuous jump from spam-commercial metrics to commercial-abuse metrics with no way to compare historical performance.

The second incident happened on December 2nd when the model evaluation pipeline failed. The eval dataset included 5,000 benchmark items labeled spam-commercial that the team used to measure classifier precision and recall. After the label was removed from the active schema, the eval pipeline could not process these items because the label category no longer existed in the schema definition. The pipeline threw a validation error and halted. The team had to manually patch the eval pipeline to accept deprecated labels as a special case.

The third incident happened on January 8th, 2026, when the compliance team requested historical data for a regulatory audit. The regulator wanted to see all spam-commercial enforcement actions from 2023 through 2025 to verify that the platform had been consistently applying its policies. The data team discovered that the spam-commercial label had been removed from the schema entirely, and while the historical label data still existed in the database, the schema definition needed to interpret those labels was gone. The team spent three days reconstructing the old label definition from Git history and documentation to produce the audit report.

The root cause was treating label deprecation as a schema deletion event instead of a lifecycle management event. Removing a label from the active schema does not make the historical data labeled with that category disappear. It makes that data uninterpretable by systems that depend on the schema to understand what labels mean. Label deprecation is not a single action. It is a multi-phase process that requires communication, migration planning, system updates, and permanent archival to ensure that removing a label from active use does not break the systems and compliance obligations that depend on historical data.

## The Deprecation Lifecycle: Announce, Transition, Sunset, Archive

Label deprecation follows a four-phase lifecycle. The first phase is announcement. You identify that a label needs to be deprecated, document the reason, and notify all stakeholders who consume that label. The announcement includes the deprecation timeline, the recommended replacement label or strategy, and the support commitment during the transition period. You announce at least 30 days before any changes take effect for low-stakes labels, and at least 90 days for labels used in production systems, regulatory reporting, or contractual obligations.

The announcement must reach every downstream consumer. This is harder than it sounds because label consumers are often distributed across many teams and systems. The annotation team knows who uses labels for labeling workflows. The data platform team knows who queries the label database. But neither team has complete visibility into which dashboards, reports, research projects, or third-party integrations depend on specific label categories. You need a label registry that tracks consumers, or you need to send the announcement broadly and ask consumers to self-identify if they are affected.

The second phase is transition. During this period, the label remains in the schema but is marked as deprecated. New items are no longer assigned the deprecated label. Instead, annotators use the replacement label or category. Existing systems that consume the deprecated label continue to work because the label still exists in the schema. But you log warnings whenever a system queries or displays the deprecated label to identify which consumers have not yet migrated to the replacement.

The transition period is when downstream consumers update their systems. Dashboards are updated to use the replacement label or to handle the deprecated label as a special historical category. Eval pipelines are updated to either exclude deprecated labels from current evaluations or to map deprecated labels to replacement categories. Training pipelines are updated to relabel historical data or to treat deprecated labels as a distinct category during the transition. The length of the transition period depends on the complexity of downstream systems and the urgency of the deprecation. Three months is typical for production systems with many consumers. Six months is appropriate for labels tied to compliance or contractual obligations.

The third phase is sunset. At the end of the transition period, you remove the deprecated label from the active schema. Annotators can no longer assign it. The schema validation rules reject any attempt to create new items with the deprecated label. But the label definition remains in the schema archive, and historical data tagged with the deprecated label is preserved. Sunset is when you verify that all downstream consumers have migrated successfully. You run tests to confirm that dashboards, pipelines, and reports work correctly without the deprecated label in the active schema.

The fourth phase is archive. The deprecated label moves into a permanent archive that preserves the label definition, the historical data, and the metadata about when and why the label was deprecated. The archive is queryable for historical analysis and compliance reporting, but it is separate from the active schema. Archive is not deletion. The data remains accessible indefinitely, but it is marked as historical and is not included in current labeling workflows or schema validation.

## What Breaks When You Remove a Label

Removing a label from the active schema creates failures across every system that depends on that label. Dashboards are the most visible failure point. If you have a dashboard panel that displays spam-commercial trends over time and you remove spam-commercial from the schema, the panel either renders empty, throws an error, or displays a misleading zero value. Users who rely on that dashboard for daily operations lose visibility into a metric they have been tracking for months or years. The fix requires updating the dashboard to use the replacement label, but that breaks trend continuity unless you also backfill historical data with the replacement label.

Eval pipelines fail when deprecated labels appear in benchmark datasets. A typical eval pipeline loads a dataset, validates that all labels in the dataset exist in the current schema, computes performance metrics, and reports results. If the dataset includes deprecated labels that are no longer in the schema, validation fails and the pipeline halts. You have three options: remove the deprecated labels from the eval dataset, which reduces the size and representativeness of your benchmark; map the deprecated labels to replacement categories, which changes the semantics of the eval; or update the eval pipeline to accept deprecated labels as a special case, which adds complexity and maintenance burden.

Trend analysis breaks when you remove a label that has been used for months or years. If you have been tracking spam-commercial precision and recall weekly for two years and you suddenly replace spam-commercial with commercial-abuse, you cannot directly compare performance before and after the change unless the two labels are semantically identical. If commercial-abuse is broader than spam-commercial, recall will appear to increase artificially because the model is now being evaluated on a wider range of content. If commercial-abuse is narrower, recall will appear to decrease. The trend line becomes discontinuous at the deprecation cutoff date, making it impossible to assess whether model performance is actually improving or whether the change is an artifact of label redefinition.

Fine-tuning datasets break when historical data includes deprecated labels. If you train a model on a dataset that includes 10,000 examples labeled spam-commercial and the schema no longer defines what spam-commercial means, the training process either fails or produces a model that includes an output category that no longer exists in your production system. You must either relabel the fine-tuning data with the replacement category, exclude the deprecated labels from training, or maintain a training schema that includes deprecated labels as valid outputs even though they are not used in production.

Compliance reporting breaks when regulators or auditors request historical data that includes deprecated labels. A content moderation platform must be able to produce enforcement reports for any time period, including periods before a label was deprecated. If you remove the label definition from your schema, you lose the ability to interpret historical data correctly. The data still exists, but you no longer have the official definition of what the label meant, which makes the data unusable for regulatory purposes.

## Soft Deprecation: Marking Labels as Deprecated Without Removing Them

Soft deprecation is the pattern where you mark a label as deprecated in the schema metadata but do not remove it from the schema definition. The label remains a valid value in the schema. Historical data tagged with the label continues to render correctly in dashboards and reports. Eval pipelines continue to process the label without errors. But annotators are instructed not to assign the deprecated label to new items, and systems that create new labels are configured to reject the deprecated label.

Soft deprecation is implemented by adding a deprecated flag to the label definition. The flag includes the deprecation date, the reason for deprecation, and the recommended replacement label. Systems that display labels use the deprecated flag to render the label with a visual indicator, such as a strikethrough or a warning icon, to show that the label is no longer actively used. Systems that allow users to select labels from a list exclude deprecated labels from the active list but include them in a separate deprecated section for users who need to query historical data.

Soft deprecation is appropriate when you need to stop using a label but you cannot afford to break downstream systems. A legal tech company used soft deprecation in late 2025 when they restructured their document classification schema. The old schema included a label called contract-amendment that was being replaced by a more granular set of labels for different types of amendments. The company could not remove contract-amendment from the schema because they had 200,000 historical documents labeled with that category and dozens of dashboards and reports that relied on it. Instead, they marked contract-amendment as deprecated, updated their annotation guidelines to use the new granular labels, and gave all downstream consumers six months to migrate. During the six-month transition, both old and new labels were valid, but the schema metadata made it clear which labels were current and which were deprecated.

Soft deprecation is also appropriate when the deprecation is speculative and you might need to revert. If you are experimenting with a new label taxonomy and you are not yet sure whether the new labels are better than the old labels, soft deprecation lets you run both in parallel without committing to full removal. Annotators use the new labels for new data, but the old labels remain available if you need to roll back. After three to six months, if the new labels prove successful, you move from soft deprecation to hard deprecation and full removal.

The downside of soft deprecation is that it increases schema complexity. Your schema now includes both active and deprecated labels, and every system that consumes the schema must understand the distinction. Annotators must be trained not to use deprecated labels even though the labels are still present in the schema. Quality control systems must flag any use of deprecated labels as an error. Over time, if you accumulate many deprecated labels without ever removing them, your schema becomes cluttered with historical artifacts that make it harder to onboard new annotators and maintain schema consistency.

## Hard Deprecation: Migrating Historical Labels and Removing the Category

Hard deprecation is the pattern where you migrate all historical labels to replacement categories, update all downstream consumers to use the replacement categories, and then remove the deprecated label from the schema entirely. Hard deprecation produces a cleaner schema because deprecated labels are fully removed, not just marked inactive. It also forces downstream consumers to migrate, which prevents the accumulation of technical debt where systems continue to depend on deprecated categories indefinitely.

Hard deprecation requires a migration plan that covers every historical label. If you are deprecating spam-commercial and replacing it with commercial-abuse, you must decide whether every item labeled spam-commercial can be automatically relabeled as commercial-abuse or whether some subset requires re-annotation. If the two categories are semantically equivalent, automatic relabeling is valid. If commercial-abuse is broader or narrower than spam-commercial, automatic relabeling changes the meaning of the historical data and may require re-annotation for high-stakes use cases.

The migration plan must also cover downstream consumers. Every dashboard, report, eval pipeline, training dataset, and API that references spam-commercial must be updated to reference commercial-abuse instead. You cannot remove the deprecated label until every consumer has migrated, or you will create production incidents. The way to verify migration completeness is to add query logging that tracks which systems are still accessing the deprecated label. Once the query logs show zero accesses for at least two weeks, you can safely remove the label.

A recommendation system team executed a hard deprecation in early 2026 for a label called product-click-bait that was being replaced by a more nuanced set of labels for different types of low-quality recommendations. They spent four weeks migrating historical labels, updating 12 downstream dashboards, and retraining their models on the new label set. They monitored query logs for two weeks to confirm that no systems were still accessing product-click-bait. Then they removed the label from the schema. The migration was successful because they had full visibility into downstream consumers and they enforced a hard cutoff where the old label was no longer accessible after migration.

Hard deprecation is appropriate when the deprecated label has been replaced by a clearly superior alternative and you want to eliminate the complexity of maintaining both old and new labels indefinitely. It is also appropriate when the deprecated label was a mistake or a temporary category that should not be preserved in the long-term schema. A content moderation team deprecated a label called potentially-sensitive-maybe in mid-2025 because the label had been created during an early prototyping phase and was too vague to be useful. Rather than preserving the label as deprecated, they migrated all historical items to more specific categories and removed the label entirely.

## Communication Requirements: Lead Time and Stakeholder Notification

Every label deprecation must include a communication plan that gives downstream consumers enough lead time to update their systems. Lead time depends on the complexity and criticality of the deprecated label. For low-stakes labels used only by the annotation team, two weeks of lead time may be sufficient. For labels used in production dashboards, eval pipelines, or customer-facing features, you need at least 60 days. For labels tied to compliance reporting or contractual obligations, you need 90 to 120 days.

The communication plan starts with a deprecation notice sent to all stakeholders. The notice includes the label being deprecated, the reason for deprecation, the recommended replacement, the deprecation timeline, and the support commitment during the transition. The deprecation timeline specifies four key dates: the announcement date, the end of the transition period when new items will no longer receive the deprecated label, the sunset date when the label will be removed from the active schema, and the archive date when the label will move into permanent historical archive.

The deprecation notice must be actionable. It is not enough to say that spam-commercial is being deprecated. You must tell consumers exactly what they need to do: update your dashboards to query commercial-abuse instead, update your eval datasets to replace spam-commercial with commercial-abuse or remove those items, update your training pipelines to relabel historical data or map the old label to the new category. The more specific the guidance, the more likely consumers will migrate successfully.

You also need a tracking mechanism to monitor migration progress. A simple spreadsheet that lists all known downstream consumers, their migration status, and their confirmed migration completion date works for small teams. A formal ticketing system works for large organizations with many consumers. The key requirement is visibility. You need to know which consumers have migrated and which have not so that you can follow up with consumers who are behind schedule and ensure that no systems are still depending on the deprecated label when you reach the sunset date.

A data platform team at a SaaS company learned the importance of tracking in late 2025 when they deprecated a label called user-churn-risk without confirming that all consumers had migrated. They sent the deprecation notice, waited the planned 60 days, and removed the label from the schema. Two days later, the customer success team reported that their churn prediction dashboard was blank. The dashboard had been querying user-churn-risk, and the data platform team had not known the dashboard existed because it was built by the customer success team without going through the central data platform. The platform team had to restore the deprecated label, extend the transition period by another 60 days, and implement a formal consumer registry to prevent similar incidents.

## Archive Requirement: Preserving Deprecated Labels for Audit and Compliance

Deprecated labels must be preserved in a permanent archive even after they are removed from the active schema. The archive includes the label definition, the historical data tagged with the label, the deprecation timeline, and the migration records. The archive is not optional. It is required for regulatory compliance, audit trails, and long-term historical analysis.

The EU AI Act requires that high-risk AI systems maintain documentation of training data and labeling processes for the lifetime of the system. If you deprecate a label that was used to train a model deployed in a high-risk context, you must preserve the label definition and the data labeled with that category for as long as the model is in production and for a retention period after the model is retired. The retention period varies by jurisdiction and industry, but five to seven years is common for financial services and healthcare. Ten years is common for legal and regulatory contexts.

The archive must be queryable. It is not sufficient to dump deprecated label definitions into a text file and store it in a documentation folder. You need the ability to run historical queries that include deprecated labels. A compliance team requesting all content moderation actions from 2023 to 2026 must be able to query both active and deprecated labels in a single request. The archive must integrate with your data warehouse or label database so that historical queries work seamlessly across active and deprecated categories.

The archive must also include the context of why the label was deprecated. A label definition alone is not sufficient if the deprecation was caused by a policy change, a legal ruling, or a regulatory requirement. The archive must include the deprecation notice, the stakeholder communication, and the migration plan so that future teams can understand the history. A legal team reviewing historical enforcement actions three years after a label was deprecated needs to know not just what the label meant, but why it was retired and what replaced it.

A healthcare AI company implemented a formal archive system in early 2026 after their auditors found gaps in their label deprecation records. The archive stored deprecated label definitions in the same database schema as active labels, with a status field that distinguished active from deprecated. Deprecated labels were excluded from annotation workflows but were fully queryable for historical analysis. The archive also included a deprecation log table that recorded the deprecation date, the reason, the replacement label, and links to the communication and migration documentation. The system cost three weeks to implement but saved the company from compliance failures and audit delays for years afterward.

The next subchapter covers schema versioning strategies: how to manage multiple versions of a label schema in parallel, when to create a new version versus updating the current version, and how to ensure that downstream consumers can handle version transitions without breaking.
