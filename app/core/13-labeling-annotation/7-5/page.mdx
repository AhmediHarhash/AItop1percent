# 7.5 — Human Override Patterns: When and How to Reject AI Labels

According to a 2025 study by Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI, human annotators reviewing AI-generated labels accept incorrect outputs 23% more often than they make errors when labeling from scratch. The pattern appears across domains: content moderation, medical imaging, legal review, and financial classification. The mechanism is automation bias—the documented tendency for humans to over-trust machine judgments even when contradictory evidence is visible. This is not a training problem you can solve with better guidelines. It is a cognitive bias that requires systematic countermeasures in workflow design, interface architecture, and quality measurement.

The failure was a training and incentive design problem. The team measured throughput and accept rate but not override accuracy. They told annotators to trust the AI unless something was obviously wrong, but they never defined "obviously wrong." They did not train annotators to recognize the AI's specific failure modes. They did not create a culture where rejecting an AI label was rewarded. The result was a feedback loop where bad AI labels became bad training data, which produced worse AI labels, which annotators continued to accept. This subchapter explains how to design override policies, train annotators to reject confidently, measure override rates as a quality signal, and turn overrides into a feedback loop that improves the AI labeler over time.

## The Psychology of Automation Bias

Automation bias is the human tendency to favor suggestions from automated systems over contradictory information from other sources, including one's own judgment. It is a well-documented phenomenon in aviation, healthcare, and now in AI-assisted labeling. When a human sees a pre-filled label from an AI system, they anchor on that label. Rejecting it requires cognitive effort: the annotator must notice the error, decide the AI is wrong, and take action to override. Accepting requires no effort: the annotator clicks approve and moves on. Over time, annotators take the path of least resistance and accept labels uncritically.

The fintech team's annotators were not lazy or incompetent. They were responding rationally to the incentive structure. They were paid per transaction reviewed. Accepting a label took three seconds. Modifying or rejecting a label took fifteen to thirty seconds because they had to type a new category, justify the override, or escalate to a supervisor. The annotators who accepted ninety-five percent of labels completed one hundred transactions per hour. The annotators who carefully evaluated each label and rejected ten percent completed sixty transactions per hour. Guess which annotators got praised in weekly standups?

Automation bias is strongest when the AI is right most of the time. If the AI is correct ninety percent of the time, annotators learn that trusting it is usually safe. They stop scrutinizing edge cases. They assume the AI has seen patterns they have not. A content moderation annotator reviewing AI-flagged posts might see a post labeled as harassment. The language is borderline, but the AI labeled it harassment, so the annotator accepts. In reality, the AI misclassified sarcasm as hostility. But the annotator trusts the AI because it is right on most posts.

You cannot eliminate automation bias, but you can design workflows and training to counteract it. You make rejection low-friction. You incentivize accuracy over speed. You show annotators the AI's confidence score, not just the label, so they know when the AI is uncertain. You train annotators on the AI's known failure modes. You audit override decisions and give feedback. You celebrate annotators who catch AI errors, not just those who process volume.

## Designing Override Policies: When Accept, When Modify, When Reject

An override policy is a documented rule set that tells annotators when to accept an AI label, when to modify it, and when to reject it outright. The policy must be specific enough to guide decisions but flexible enough to handle edge cases. It must align with the task's quality requirements and the AI's known weaknesses.

A basic three-tier policy works for many tasks. **Accept** if the AI label is correct and complete. **Modify** if the AI label is partially correct but incomplete or imprecise—for example, the AI labeled a document as contract but the correct label is employment contract, or the AI extracted a date but formatted it incorrectly. **Reject** if the AI label is fundamentally wrong and provides no useful signal—for example, the AI labeled a refund request as a product inquiry, or the AI extracted a person's name when the text contains no person.

The fintech team's original policy was vague: "Accept if correct, reject if wrong." This left too much to interpretation. The revised policy was explicit. Accept if the AI category matches the merchant and transaction description and the annotator would have chosen the same category independently. Modify if the AI category is close but not precise—for example, the AI labeled a coffee shop transaction as dining when the correct label is coffee and cafes. Reject if the AI category is unrelated to the transaction—for example, the AI labeled a parking meter charge as entertainment. The revised policy included twenty examples covering common ambiguities.

For tasks with confidence scores, the policy can incorporate thresholds. Accept without review if confidence is above 0.95 and the label passes automated validation rules. Review carefully if confidence is between 0.7 and 0.95. Reject and relabel from scratch if confidence is below 0.7. This tiered approach concentrates human effort on uncertain cases. A legal document classification system might auto-accept labels with confidence above 0.98, which represent eighty percent of the volume, and route the remaining twenty percent to human review. The reviewers know these are uncertain cases and scrutinize them accordingly.

The policy must also cover partial labels. In structured extraction tasks, the AI might extract three of five fields correctly. The override policy should specify: accept the correct fields, modify the incorrect ones, and fill in the missing ones. Do not reject the entire label just because one field is wrong. A resume parser might correctly extract name and email but incorrectly parse the phone number. The annotator modifies the phone number and accepts the rest. This reduces redundant work.

You also need rules for ambiguous cases. Some examples are genuinely ambiguous: two human experts would disagree on the label. The override policy should address this. One approach is to escalate ambiguous cases to a senior annotator or to label them with a special "ambiguous" tag and exclude them from training. Another approach is to require multiple annotations and use majority vote. A content moderation task might have three annotators review borderline posts. If all three agree, the label is accepted. If two agree, the majority label is used. If all three disagree, the post is escalated or excluded. This prevents the AI from training on noise.

## Training Annotators to Override Confidently

Training is where override policy becomes practice. Annotators must learn not just the policy rules but the reasoning behind them. They must see examples of the AI's failure modes. They must practice rejecting incorrect labels without guilt or hesitation. They must understand that their job is quality assurance, not rubber-stamping.

The fintech team rebuilt their training program. New annotators went through a two-day onboarding. Day one covered the task: what are transaction categories, how do you distinguish dining from groceries, what are the edge cases. Day two covered the AI labeler: how it works, where it fails, how to interpret confidence scores, and how to override. The training included fifty practice examples, half of which had incorrect AI labels. Annotators had to identify the errors and correct them. They got immediate feedback. Annotators who missed more than three errors repeated the training.

The training emphasized the AI's known weaknesses. The model struggled with mixed-category merchants—for example, a gas station that also sells groceries. It confused rideshare services with taxi services. It mislabeled subscription payments as one-time purchases. The training showed ten examples of each failure mode. Annotators learned to watch for these patterns. When they saw a transaction at a gas station, they checked the line items before accepting the AI's label. When they saw a rideshare charge, they verified the merchant name.

The training also included confidence score interpretation. The team showed annotators the calibration curve: for labels with confidence 0.9 to 1.0, the AI is correct ninety-four percent of the time. For labels with confidence 0.7 to 0.9, the AI is correct seventy-eight percent of the time. For labels below 0.7, the AI is correct fifty-three percent of the time—barely better than random. Annotators learned to treat low-confidence labels with skepticism and high-confidence labels with cautious trust, not blind acceptance.

Ongoing training is just as important as onboarding. The AI model evolves. Its failure modes shift. New categories are added. Annotators need refreshers. The fintech team ran monthly calibration sessions. A senior annotator reviewed ten recent overrides—five correct overrides and five incorrect accepts—and walked the team through the reasoning. This kept the override policy top of mind and reinforced good habits.

You also need to train annotators to articulate why they override. A simple "wrong label" comment is not enough. A good override comment might be: "AI labeled as dining but merchant is a grocery store with a café, correct label is groceries." This creates a feedback loop. The comments document the AI's errors and provide training data for improving the model. A team that collects structured override reasons can analyze them quarterly and identify the top failure modes to address in the next model iteration.

## Tracking Override Rates as a Quality Signal

Override rate is the percentage of AI labels that annotators modify or reject. It is one of the most important metrics in AI-assisted labeling. A very low override rate might indicate automation bias. A very high override rate indicates the AI is not helping. The right override rate depends on the AI's accuracy and the task's tolerance for errors.

The fintech team tracked override rate by annotator, by category, and by confidence band. The overall override rate was twelve percent after the training overhaul, up from nine percent before. But the breakdown was revealing. For labels with confidence above 0.95, the override rate was four percent. For labels with confidence 0.7 to 0.95, the override rate was twenty-three percent. For labels below 0.7, the override rate was fifty-eight percent. This matched expectations: low-confidence labels should be overridden more often.

By annotator, the override rates ranged from seven percent to nineteen percent. The team investigated the outliers. The annotator with a seven percent override rate was fast but inaccurate: a quality audit found that they missed errors. The team retrained them. The annotator with a nineteen percent override rate was highly accurate: they caught subtle errors others missed. The team promoted them to senior annotator and had them lead calibration sessions.

By category, the override rate for dining was six percent, but for transportation it was twenty-eight percent. This revealed that the AI struggled with transportation. The team dug into the overrides and found the AI confused rideshare with taxi, public transit with parking, and airline tickets with travel agencies. They added more training data for transportation subcategories and retrained the model. The override rate for transportation dropped to sixteen percent in the next model version.

You should also track override accuracy: of the labels annotators override, how many are correct overrides and how many are incorrect? You measure this with a second-pass review by a senior annotator or expert. If an annotator overrides one hundred labels and a senior reviewer finds that ninety of the overrides were correct, the override accuracy is ninety percent. If only sixty were correct, the annotator is over-rejecting, possibly due to misunderstanding the policy or the task.

Override rate trends over time tell you if the AI is improving or degrading. If override rate decreases over successive model versions, the AI is learning from the feedback and making fewer errors. If override rate increases, the model is regressing, possibly due to distribution shift in production data or noisy labels in recent training batches. A healthcare claims review system tracked override rate monthly. For the first six months, override rate declined from eighteen percent to eleven percent as the model improved. In month seven, override rate spiked to sixteen percent. The team investigated and found that a new claims processing system had changed the format of claim descriptions, and the AI had not adapted. They retrained on the new format and override rate dropped to twelve percent.

You also track the cost impact. If an AI label saves ten seconds per example and you review ten thousand examples per week, that is 27.7 hours saved. If the override rate is fifteen percent, you spend extra time on 1,500 overrides, perhaps twenty seconds per override, totaling 8.3 hours. Net savings: 19.4 hours per week, or $580 per week at $30 per hour. If the AI improves and override rate drops to ten percent, net savings increase to 22.1 hours per week, or $663. Tracking this quantifies the value of improving the AI labeler.

## Feedback Loops: Turning Overrides into Model Improvements

Every override is a training signal. The annotator saw an example where the AI was wrong and corrected it. That correction is gold. If you feed overrides back into the model as high-confidence training examples, the model learns from its mistakes. This creates a virtuous cycle: the AI makes errors, annotators correct them, the model learns, the AI makes fewer errors, annotators spend less time correcting, and quality improves.

The fintech team built a feedback pipeline. Every override was logged with the original AI label, the corrected label, the annotator's confidence, and the override reason. Once per month, the team reviewed the overrides. They filtered out overrides where the annotator's confidence was low or where the override reason was vague, leaving high-quality corrections. They added these corrections to the training set with high sample weight, signaling to the model that these examples were especially important. They retrained the model and deployed the new version.

Over six months, the model's accuracy on a held-out test set improved from eighty-two percent to eighty-nine percent, and the override rate dropped from fifteen percent to nine percent. The team attributed half of the improvement to the override feedback loop and half to other model improvements like better feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. But the override loop was the cheapest improvement: it required no new labeled data, just better use of the data already being created.

You can also use overrides to identify systematic errors. If two hundred overrides in a month involve the AI confusing two specific categories, that is a signal to add more training data for those categories or to adjust the model's decision boundary. A customer support ticket classifier found that thirty percent of overrides involved the AI labeling billing questions as account management questions. The team realized the two categories overlapped significantly and that the original taxonomy was poorly defined. They collapsed the two categories into one and retrained. Override rate dropped by twelve percentage points.

Overrides also reveal label drift. If the override rate for a specific category suddenly increases, it might mean the definition of that category has shifted in production but not in the training data. A fraud detection system saw override rates for a specific fraud type jump from eight percent to twenty-four percent over two months. The team investigated and found that fraudsters had changed tactics: the fraud pattern had evolved, but the model had not. They labeled recent examples of the new pattern, retrained, and override rate returned to normal.

You need to be careful not to create feedback loops that amplify annotator errors. If an annotator systematically mislabels a category and their overrides are fed back into the model, the model will learn the mislabeling. You mitigate this by requiring high-confidence overrides to enter the training set, by having senior annotators review a sample of overrides before they are used for training, or by requiring multiple annotators to agree on an override before it is added to the training set.

Some teams use active learning on overrides: they prioritize overrides where the AI was most confident but wrong. These are the examples where the model was most mistaken, and correcting them has the highest impact. A document classifier might focus on overrides where the AI predicted a label with 0.95 confidence but the annotator corrected it. These examples are near the decision boundary and are highly informative.

## Handling Disagreements Between Annotators and AI

Sometimes the AI is right and the annotator is wrong. This happens when the annotator misunderstands the task, misreads the example, or applies an outdated policy. If you treat all overrides as ground truth, you pollute the training set with annotator errors. You need a way to adjudicate disagreements.

One approach is to flag overrides where the AI was highly confident. If the AI predicted a label with 0.97 confidence and the annotator overrode it, that is unusual. You route these flagged overrides to a senior annotator for review. The senior annotator sees the AI label, the annotator's override, and the raw example. They decide who is right. If the annotator is right, the override is added to the training set and the AI's failure mode is documented. If the AI is right, the override is discarded, and the annotator receives feedback.

A legal document classification system flagged overrides where the AI confidence was above 0.95. Ten percent of these overrides were reviewed by a senior paralegal. In sixty percent of cases, the annotator was right: the AI had misclassified due to an edge case the model had not seen. In forty percent of cases, the AI was right: the annotator had misunderstood the document type or the taxonomy. The annotators whose overrides were frequently wrong received additional training. The annotators whose overrides were frequently right were recognized as high performers.

Another approach is to use a second annotator. When an annotator overrides an AI label, the example is sent to a second annotator who sees the raw example but not the AI label or the first annotator's override. If the second annotator agrees with the override, the override is accepted. If the second annotator agrees with the AI, the override is rejected. If the second annotator provides a third label, the example is escalated. This double-blind review prevents bias and ensures overrides are well-founded.

You also need to handle cases where the task definition is ambiguous. If the AI and annotator disagree because the label is genuinely ambiguous, neither is wrong. You resolve this by clarifying the task definition, adding examples to the annotation guidelines, or accepting that some examples are too ambiguous to label and excluding them from training. A sentiment analysis task might have tweets that are both positive and negative—sarcastic praise, for example. The AI might label it positive, the annotator might label it negative. Neither is wrong. The team decides to add a "mixed" label or to exclude these tweets from training.

## Measuring the Cost-Benefit of AI-Assisted Labeling

AI-assisted labeling is only valuable if it saves time or improves quality compared to labeling from scratch. You measure this by comparing throughput, accuracy, and cost between AI-assisted labeling and unassisted labeling. The fintech team ran a controlled experiment. They assigned half of a labeling batch to AI-assisted workflow: annotators reviewed AI labels and could override. They assigned the other half to unassisted workflow: annotators labeled from scratch with no AI assistance. They measured time per label, accuracy, and annotator satisfaction.

Results: AI-assisted annotators completed labels in a median of eight seconds per transaction. Unassisted annotators completed labels in a median of fourteen seconds per transaction. AI assistance saved six seconds per label, a forty-three percent speedup. But accuracy was initially lower in the AI-assisted group: ninety-one percent versus ninety-four percent in the unassisted group, due to automation bias. After the training overhaul, AI-assisted accuracy improved to ninety-three percent, nearly matching unassisted. The team concluded AI assistance was valuable once automation bias was addressed.

The cost analysis was straightforward. The team labeled fifty thousand transactions per month. At fourteen seconds per transaction unassisted, that is 194 hours of annotation labor. At eight seconds per transaction assisted, that is 111 hours. Savings: eighty-three hours per month, or $2,490 at $30 per hour. The cost of running the AI labeler—compute and infrastructure—was $600 per month. Net savings: $1,890 per month, or $22,680 per year. The cost of building the AI labeler and training the annotators was $18,000. Payback period: 9.5 months.

You also measure quality-adjusted throughput. If AI assistance increases speed by forty percent but decreases accuracy by five percent, the net value depends on your quality requirements. If accuracy is critical and a five percent drop is unacceptable, AI assistance is not worth it. If speed is critical and a small accuracy drop is tolerable, AI assistance is valuable. The fintech team's quality requirement was ninety-two percent accuracy. Once AI-assisted accuracy reached ninety-three percent, AI assistance was a clear win.

Finally, you measure annotator satisfaction. Some annotators prefer AI assistance because it reduces repetitive work. Others find it frustrating because they feel the AI second-guesses them or makes their job less skilled. The fintech team surveyed annotators quarterly. Seventy-three percent preferred AI assistance after the training overhaul, up from fifty-two percent before. The main complaints were that the AI was sometimes wrong in obvious ways and that overriding was initially cumbersome. The team addressed the first by improving the model and the second by streamlining the override UI.

## Designing the Override Interface

The user interface for overrides matters. If overriding is slow or confusing, annotators will avoid it even when necessary. If accepting is the default action and overriding requires extra clicks, automation bias is amplified. You need an interface that makes overriding as easy as accepting.

The fintech team's original interface showed the transaction details and the AI label at the top. Annotators clicked a green "Accept" button or a red "Reject" button. If they clicked reject, a modal popped up asking them to choose a new label from a dropdown and type a reason. This took four clicks and fifteen seconds. The team redesigned the interface. The AI label was shown as a pre-filled dropdown, not a static label. Annotators could click the dropdown, select a different label, and click save. Two clicks, five seconds. The reject button was removed. Overriding became a natural part of the workflow.

The new interface also showed the AI's confidence score in small text below the label: "Confidence: 0.87." Annotators learned to pay extra attention when confidence was below 0.9. The interface highlighted the transaction description and merchant name, the two fields most relevant to categorization. This reduced the cognitive load of finding the relevant information.

For multi-field extraction tasks, the interface should show each field separately with the AI's predicted value pre-filled. Annotators can accept some fields and modify others. A resume parser interface might show name, email, phone, address, and work history as separate fields. If the AI extracted name and email correctly but phone incorrectly, the annotator changes only the phone field. This is faster than rejecting the entire label and re-entering everything.

The interface should also support bulk operations. If an annotator is reviewing a batch of similar examples and the AI is consistently wrong in the same way, they should be able to override all of them at once. A content moderation interface might let annotators select ten flagged posts, change the label from harassment to not-harassment, and apply the change to all ten. This prevents repetitive work.

Some teams use keyboard shortcuts to speed up overrides. Pressing "1" accepts, pressing "2" rejects, pressing "3" modifies. Power users can review labels without touching the mouse. A data entry team using keyboard shortcuts increased throughput by eighteen percent compared to mouse-only interaction.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

The most common pitfall is measuring the wrong thing. If you measure accept rate and reward high accept rates, you incentivize automation bias. If you measure throughput and reward speed, you incentivize careless overrides or careless accepts. You must measure accuracy, override accuracy, and quality-adjusted throughput. A balanced scorecard might include: labels per hour, accuracy on audited examples, override rate, and override accuracy. Annotators are evaluated on all four, not just one.

The second pitfall is not training annotators on the AI's failure modes. If annotators do not know where the AI is likely to fail, they cannot scrutinize those cases. Training must include examples of the AI's errors, not just examples of correct labels. The fintech team's training included a section called "When the AI Gets It Wrong" with twenty examples of common errors. This primed annotators to watch for those patterns.

The third pitfall is not auditing overrides. If you assume all overrides are correct, you miss annotator errors. A regular audit process, where a senior annotator reviews a sample of overrides, catches mistakes and provides feedback. The fintech team audited five percent of overrides monthly. Annotators with high error rates received one-on-one coaching.

The fourth pitfall is not closing the feedback loop. If overrides are logged but never analyzed, you miss the opportunity to improve the AI. A monthly review of override patterns, followed by model retraining, turns overrides into model improvements. The fintech team treated override analysis as a standing agenda item in their monthly model review meeting.

The fifth pitfall is using AI assistance for tasks where the AI is not good enough. If the AI is only sixty percent accurate, AI assistance wastes time: annotators spend more time correcting errors than they save from pre-filled labels. AI assistance is valuable when the AI is at least seventy-five to eighty percent accurate. Below that threshold, labeling from scratch is faster. The fintech team piloted AI assistance on a new category and found the AI was only sixty-eight percent accurate. They paused AI assistance for that category, collected more training data, and re-enabled assistance once accuracy reached seventy-nine percent.

## The Override Rate Sweet Spot

There is an optimal override rate for most tasks. Too low, and you have automation bias. Too high, and the AI is not helping. The sweet spot depends on the AI's accuracy and the task's difficulty, but for most tasks it is between eight and twenty percent. An override rate in this range indicates the AI is doing useful work—accepting most labels correctly—but annotators are still thinking critically and catching errors.

The fintech team's target override rate was twelve percent. When the rate dropped below eight percent, they audited annotations and usually found automation bias. When the rate climbed above eighteen percent, they investigated the AI's errors and often found a new failure mode or a data distribution shift. They treated override rate as a leading indicator: a change in override rate signaled something worth investigating.

You can also set different target override rates by confidence band. For labels with confidence above 0.95, the target override rate might be three to five percent. For labels with confidence 0.7 to 0.95, the target might be fifteen to twenty-five percent. For labels below 0.7, the target might be forty to sixty percent. This reflects the fact that low-confidence labels should be overridden more often.

Some teams use override rate to decide when to stop using AI assistance. If the override rate is above fifty percent, the AI is creating more work than it saves, and you should label from scratch. If the override rate is below three percent and audit accuracy is high, you might skip human review entirely for high-confidence labels and only review low-confidence ones. This creates a tiered workflow: auto-accept above 0.95 confidence, human review between 0.7 and 0.95, and reject or escalate below 0.7.

The fintech team implemented this tiered workflow for their most mature category, dining. Labels with confidence above 0.96 were auto-accepted. Labels with confidence 0.75 to 0.96 went to human review. Labels below 0.75 were rejected and relabeled from scratch. This reduced review volume by sixty-two percent while maintaining ninety-three percent accuracy. They planned to roll out the tiered workflow to other categories as the AI matured.

## Building an Override Culture: Psychological and Organizational Factors

Beyond process and metrics, override effectiveness depends on organizational culture. If annotators feel that overriding the AI is questioning their manager's investment in the AI system, or if overrides are seen as slowing down the team, annotators will hesitate to override even when they should. You need a culture where overriding is not just permitted but expected and celebrated when appropriate.

The fintech team struggled with this initially. The AI labeling system had been pitched to executives as a way to double annotation throughput. Managers celebrated low override rates in team meetings, implicitly signaling that overrides were failures. Annotators internalized this. An annotator who found an error in an AI label would sometimes accept it anyway, reasoning that the error would be caught later in model evaluation. But it was not caught later—it became training data, and the model learned the error.

The team reset the culture by changing how they talked about overrides. Instead of framing overrides as the AI failing, they framed them as the annotators teaching the AI. Every override was a training signal. Annotators were not rejecting the AI's work; they were refining it. Managers started celebrating high-quality overrides in team meetings: "This week, three annotators caught a systematic error where the AI was confusing two merchant types. We retrained the model with their corrections, and accuracy on that segment improved by six points. Great work." This reframed overrides as contributions, not criticisms.

The team also made override data visible. They published a weekly dashboard showing override rate by annotator, by category, and by confidence band. They highlighted annotators whose overrides had led to model improvements. They showed the cost savings from catching errors early rather than discovering them in production. This transparency reinforced that overrides were valuable and that the team was learning from them.

Another cultural factor is trust. Annotators need to trust that their overrides will be taken seriously and acted upon. If annotators override labels and nothing changes—the model is never retrained, the errors recur, the feedback is ignored—they stop overriding. A customer support ticket classifier had annotators who diligently logged overrides for six months, but the model was never retrained due to infrastructure issues. The override rate dropped from fourteen percent to six percent as annotators gave up. When the team finally fixed the retraining pipeline and pushed a new model, they had to re-train annotators to override again because the habit had atrophied.

You also need psychological safety. Annotators must feel comfortable admitting when they are unsure and escalating difficult cases. If the culture punishes uncertainty, annotators will guess rather than escalate, and label quality suffers. The fintech team created an "unsure" button in their interface. If an annotator reviewed an AI label and was unsure whether it was correct, they clicked unsure, and the example was routed to a senior annotator. This removed the pressure to make a definitive call when the annotator lacked confidence.

Finally, you need to manage annotator fatigue. AI-assisted labeling, when done well, concentrates harder examples on human reviewers. This is efficient but exhausting. Annotators see a higher proportion of edge cases, ambiguous examples, and errors. This is cognitively demanding. You need to rotate annotators between AI-assisted and unassisted tasks, give them breaks, and monitor for burnout. One content moderation team found that annotators working on AI-assisted review reported higher stress levels than those labeling from scratch, even though they processed fewer total examples. The team adjusted workloads and provided additional support.

## Override Data as a Product Development Signal

Override data is not just a labeling quality metric; it is a product development signal. If users are overriding AI labels in production, that tells you the AI is making errors that matter. If certain types of overrides are common, that tells you where to invest in model improvements or product features. If override patterns change over time, that tells you the data distribution is shifting or user expectations are evolving.

A legal contract analysis tool used AI to extract key terms from contracts: parties, dates, payment amounts, termination clauses. Users could review and override the extractions. The product team tracked override patterns and found that overrides for payment amounts were rare—the AI was ninety-six percent accurate. Overrides for termination clauses were common—the AI was only seventy-two percent accurate. The team prioritized improving termination clause extraction. They also noticed that overrides spiked when the company onboarded clients in new industries. A healthcare client overrode thirty-eight percent of AI labels in their first week. The team realized the AI was trained on commercial contracts and did not generalize well to healthcare. They collected healthcare contract data and retrained.

Override data also reveals gaps in the task definition. If annotators frequently override the same label with multiple different labels, the task is ambiguous. A customer feedback categorization system found that annotators overrode the AI's "product feedback" label with "bug report," "feature request," and "usability issue" in roughly equal proportions. The team realized "product feedback" was too broad. They split it into three subcategories, retrained the model, and override rate dropped by nine percentage points.

You can also use override data to estimate the cost of errors. If users override ten percent of labels and each override takes twenty seconds, and you process one million labels per year, that is 55,555 hours of user time spent on overrides, or $1.67 million at $30 per hour. If improving the AI from ninety percent to ninety-five percent accuracy would reduce override rate to five percent, that saves $835,000 per year. This quantifies the business case for model improvements.

Some teams tie override data to SLAs. A contract might specify that the AI-assisted labeling tool will maintain an override rate below fifteen percent on the customer's data. If override rate exceeds fifteen percent, the vendor must improve the model or reduce the price. This creates accountability and aligns incentives: the vendor is motivated to reduce override rate, which benefits the customer.

## Handling Overrides in Multi-Annotator Workflows

Many labeling workflows involve multiple annotators per example: one annotator labels, a second reviews. When AI labels are introduced, the workflow becomes more complex. The first annotator reviews the AI label and may override. The second annotator reviews the first annotator's decision. If the first annotator accepted the AI label, should the second annotator re-evaluate the AI label or just verify that the first annotator followed the policy? If the first annotator overrode the AI label, should the second annotator see the original AI label or only the override?

Different workflows answer these questions differently. In a **cascading review** workflow, the second annotator sees only the first annotator's final label, not the AI's original label. This prevents the AI label from biasing the reviewer. The reviewer evaluates the label on its merits. If they disagree, they override the first annotator's decision. This is the cleanest approach but it discards information: the second annotator does not know whether the first annotator accepted or overrode the AI, so they cannot assess whether the first annotator is over-accepting or over-rejecting.

In a **transparent review** workflow, the second annotator sees both the AI label and the first annotator's decision. If the first annotator accepted, the reviewer knows to scrutinize for automation bias. If the first annotator overrode, the reviewer knows to evaluate whether the override was justified. This provides more context but introduces bias: the second annotator might anchor on the AI label just as the first annotator did.

In a **parallel review** workflow, two annotators independently review the AI label without seeing each other's decisions. If they agree, the label is finalized. If they disagree, a third annotator adjudicates or the example is escalated. This maximizes independence but doubles the annotation cost. It is typically used only for high-value or high-risk examples.

The fintech team used a hybrid approach. For AI labels with confidence above 0.9, a single annotator reviewed and could override. For AI labels with confidence below 0.9, two annotators reviewed in parallel, and disagreements were escalated. This concentrated the expensive parallel review on uncertain cases. The team found that parallel review caught errors that single-annotator review missed: inter-annotator agreement on low-confidence examples was only seventy-four percent, meaning one of the two annotators was wrong twenty-six percent of the time. For high-confidence examples, inter-annotator agreement was ninety-six percent, so parallel review was not cost-effective.

Another consideration is whether to show override statistics to the second annotator. If the first annotator has an override rate of thirty percent, should the second annotator know this? On one hand, it provides context: a high override rate might indicate the first annotator is conscientious or that the AI is performing poorly on this batch. On the other hand, it creates bias: the second annotator might scrutinize a high-override annotator more harshly or trust a low-override annotator too much. Most teams do not show individual override statistics during review, only in aggregate reports to managers.

## Long-Term Evolution: From Override to Automation

The ultimate goal of AI-assisted labeling is not to maintain a steady override rate forever. The goal is to reduce override rate over time as the AI improves, eventually reaching a point where most labels can be auto-accepted and human review is needed only for edge cases. This requires continuous investment in model improvements, calibration, and quality assurance.

The fintech team tracked override rate over eighteen months. In month one, override rate was twenty-three percent. By month six, after three model retraining cycles incorporating override feedback, it was fourteen percent. By month twelve, it was nine percent. By month eighteen, it was six percent. At that point, they implemented the tiered workflow: auto-accept high-confidence labels, review medium-confidence labels, relabel low-confidence labels. This reduced total review volume by seventy-one percent while maintaining accuracy.

The team also shifted their labeling focus. As the AI handled routine cases, annotators spent more time on edge cases and new categories. When a new transaction category was introduced, annotators labeled examples from scratch until the model reached eighty percent accuracy, then switched to AI-assisted review. This created a continuous cycle of automation and human oversight.

Some teams eventually move from review to audit. Once the AI is highly accurate and well-calibrated, you stop reviewing every label and instead audit a random sample. If the audit finds that the AI maintains ninety-five percent accuracy on high-confidence labels, you continue auto-accepting. If accuracy drops below ninety-five percent, you resume human review. This reduces costs further while maintaining quality.

The transition from override-heavy to automation-heavy workflows is not automatic. It requires deliberate investment in the AI labeler, in annotator training, in quality processes, and in infrastructure. It requires tracking the right metrics and acting on them. Teams that do this well reduce labeling costs by sixty to eighty percent while improving quality. Teams that do not—teams that introduce AI assistance but never improve the AI, never retrain annotators, never close the feedback loop—end up with the worst of both worlds: high costs, low quality, and frustrated annotators.

Override patterns are one of the richest sources of insight in AI-assisted labeling. They reveal the AI's weaknesses, the annotators' understanding of the task, and the quality of the training data. Teams that track, audit, and act on override data build better models faster and at lower cost. The next subchapter covers calibrating AI labelers against human ground truth: how do you measure the AI's accuracy, adjust for bias, and ensure the AI's confidence scores are trustworthy enough to drive automated accept/reject decisions.
