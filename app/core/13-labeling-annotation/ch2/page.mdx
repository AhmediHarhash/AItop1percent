# Chapter 2 — Label Ontology and Schema Governance

Your label set is a contract. It defines what judgments are possible, how they relate to each other, and what they mean. When that contract is unclear, overlapping, or ungoverned, every downstream system — evals, dashboards, release gates, training data — inherits the confusion. This chapter covers the discipline of treating your label ontology as a governed, versioned source of truth.
