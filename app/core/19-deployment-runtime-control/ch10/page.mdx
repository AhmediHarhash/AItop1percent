# Chapter 10 — Deployment Patterns and Rollout Mechanics

The actual mechanics of getting changes into production safely. Blue-green gives you atomic switches — the new version is fully deployed but idle, then you flip a load balancer and all traffic moves in one instant. Canary gives you graduated exposure — one percent of traffic, then five percent, then twenty-five percent, with validation gates at each step. Shadow gives you risk-free comparison — both versions run on every request, you log both outputs, but users only see the old version. Rolling deployment updates servers one at a time, dark launch enables infrastructure without routing traffic, and progressive delivery combines feature flags with automated canary rollout. Each pattern has costs and benefits. Each fits different risk profiles.

This chapter covers the full deployment pattern catalog, staged rollouts with validation gates at each step, progressive delivery automation that moves traffic only when metrics stay green, deployment scheduling that avoids Fridays and holidays, multi-layer coordination when model changes require prompt changes, deployment dashboards that show real-time rollout health, and the pre-flight checklist that catches the mistake before it becomes an incident. By the end, you will have the deployment infrastructure to move fast without breaking production.

*The best deployment infrastructure is invisible when everything works and saves you in seconds when something breaks.*
