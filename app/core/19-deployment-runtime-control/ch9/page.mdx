# Chapter 9 — Prompt and Configuration Deployment

Prompts are the most frequently changed component in AI systems, yet most teams deploy them like code — slowly, painfully, and without the ability to revert quickly. A product manager wants to adjust the tone. A customer success lead wants to add a safety instruction. An engineer discovers that one phrase in the system message cuts hallucinations by half. All of these changes should be deployable in seconds, testable in isolation, and reversible instantly. Instead, they are buried in application code, deployed on the same schedule as backend changes, and impossible to A/B test without duplicating the entire inference stack.

Prompts should be deployable artifacts with their own version control, testing pipelines, rollout mechanics, and instant rollback. They should live in registries, not repositories. They should be validated against eval suites before reaching production. They should support A/B testing, hot-reload, and environment-specific overrides. This chapter covers prompt-as-code, version control, integration with eval pipelines, templating engines, A/B testing, hot-reload without redeployment, configuration separation, rollback, governance workflows, and multi-environment management. By the end, you will have infrastructure where prompt changes feel as safe and fast as changing a feature flag.

*If you can change a prompt in production in five seconds and revert it in three, you can move faster than competitors who treat prompts like code.*
