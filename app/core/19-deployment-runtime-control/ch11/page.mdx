# Chapter 11 — Rollback Mechanics and Recovery

The ability to revert is more important than the ability to deploy. If rollback takes fifteen minutes, you will accumulate fifteen minutes of user impact during every incident. If rollback takes fifteen seconds, incidents become minor inconveniences instead of disasters. Every deployment pattern in Chapter 10 must have a matching rollback pattern. Blue-green rollback is a load balancer flip in the opposite direction. Canary rollback is stopping traffic to the new version and draining connections. Shadow rollback is deleting the new deployment without touching user-facing traffic. The pattern matters less than the speed.

This chapter covers instant rollback mechanics, partial rollback by user segment when only some cohorts are affected, data-aware rollback when outputs have already been served and cannot be unsent, multi-layer reversion when you need to roll back the model but keep the new prompt, rollback testing where you practice recovery before you need it, rollback triggers that decide between automated revert and manual judgment, rollback communication that tells users and stakeholders what happened without creating panic, post-rollback analysis that turns every revert into a learning moment, and rollback infrastructure design that makes reversion always possible. By the end, you will have systems that can always revert, and teams that are never afraid to deploy because they know they can always go back.

*If your team hesitates to deploy because rollback is slow or risky, you do not have a deployment problem — you have a rollback problem.*
