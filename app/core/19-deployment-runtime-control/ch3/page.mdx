# Chapter 3 — Scaling and Load Management

LLM scaling is fundamentally different from web service scaling. Traditional auto-scaling uses CPU utilization or request count as signals. That breaks immediately with LLMs because a single long-context request can consume the same GPU memory and compute as fifty short requests. A summarization task with a 100,000-token input has nothing in common with a translation request for three sentences. Request count is a meaningless metric. CPU utilization is a meaningless metric. You need to scale on token throughput, memory pressure, queue depth, and P99 latency — and even those signals lag the actual problem by seconds or minutes.

This chapter teaches LLM-specific scaling architecture. You'll learn auto-scaling strategies that account for variable latency, load balancing that doesn't assume uniform request cost, queue management that prevents starvation, graceful degradation patterns that sacrifice the right things under overload, and multi-region architecture for global scale. By the end, you'll understand how to design a system that handles 10x traffic spikes without degrading user experience or burning through your GPU budget.

*The moment your system hits production scale is the moment you discover whether your scaling assumptions were correct or catastrophically wrong.*
