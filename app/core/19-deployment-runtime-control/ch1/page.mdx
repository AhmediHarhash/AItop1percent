# Chapter 1 — Why AI Deployment Is Different

Traditional CI/CD assumes deterministic software. You deploy code. It either works or crashes. The failure modes are predictable. AI systems break every one of these assumptions. Deploying a new prompt can silently degrade quality for weeks before anyone notices. Swapping a model can shift behavior in ways your tests didn't catch. Changing a tool definition can introduce a new failure mode that only surfaces under production traffic patterns. The blast radius of AI deployment failures extends far beyond crashed services into silent quality degradation, hallucinated responses, and user-facing nonsense that erodes trust faster than any outage.

This chapter establishes the foundational architecture for AI deployment. You'll learn the five deployment layers that actually change in AI systems, the control plane versus data plane separation that enables safe rollout at scale, the unique risk profile of AI deployment, and the maturity progression from YOLO deployments to enterprise-grade release infrastructure. By the end, you'll understand why AI deployment requires its own discipline, its own tooling, and its own operational model.

*The difference between shipping AI and shipping software is that software crashes loudly and AI degrades silently.*
