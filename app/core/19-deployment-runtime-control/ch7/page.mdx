# Chapter 7 — Feature Flags and Dynamic Configuration

Feature flags decouple deployment from release. You deploy code once, then control what runs at runtime without redeploying. For web applications, this means toggling UI features or API endpoints. For AI systems, this means switching prompts, models, tools, routing rules, and guardrails while the system is running. You can roll out a new model to five percent of traffic, enable a new tool only for premium tenants, A/B test two prompt variants, or kill a failing model with a single flag flip. Without feature flags, every change requires a deployment. With them, you change behavior in seconds, roll back instantly when things break, and run experiments without touching production infrastructure.

This chapter teaches feature flag patterns for AI systems. You'll learn static versus dynamic flags, percentage rollouts that gradually expose new behavior, user and tenant-targeted flags for per-customer control, and conditional flags that activate based on request context. You'll learn flag evaluation engines like LaunchDarkly, Statsig, and Unleash, flag lifecycle management from creation through cleanup, and analytics that track flag impact on quality and cost. You'll learn hot-reload configuration that changes prompts and routing rules without restarting services, feature flags specifically for AI components like prompts and tools, and governance policies that control who can change which flags and when. By the end, you'll have the infrastructure to change AI behavior safely, quickly, and reversibly without redeployment.

*The model that breaks production at 3am gets fixed with a feature flag flip at 3:02am, not a deployment at 5am after emergency approval.*
