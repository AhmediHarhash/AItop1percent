# Chapter 8 — Model and Artifact Versioning

Model versioning is harder than code versioning. Code is text. You can diff two versions line by line, see exactly what changed, and trace the history through git. Models are multi-gigabyte binary artifacts. A file hash changes, but you have no idea what changed semantically. Did the model get better at summarization or worse at following instructions? Did it memorize new training data or forget old capabilities? You can't diff two models and see the changes. You need semantic versioning that captures what the version means, artifact registries that store models with full provenance, metadata that tracks training data and hyperparameters, and dependency tracking that knows when changing one model breaks another. Without this, model versioning is just file management. With it, you have reproducibility, rollback, and the ability to answer "what changed" when something breaks.

This chapter teaches model and artifact versioning for production AI systems. You'll learn semantic versioning adapted for models, artifact registries like MLflow and Hugging Face Hub, model packaging standards including ONNX and Safetensors, and base-model-plus-adapter composition for managing LoRA versions separately from base models. You'll learn metadata versioning that captures provenance, dependency tracking that maps model relationships, version pinning for reproducibility, and deprecation policies that sunset old models without breaking production. You'll learn the model registry pattern that makes one system the source of truth for all model versions, and when to version base models versus adapters versus full merged checkpoints. By the end, you'll have the infrastructure to manage models as versioned, traceable, reproducible artifacts instead of files someone emailed you.

*When production breaks and someone asks which model version is running, the answer should be in a registry, not in Slack DMs from three months ago.*
