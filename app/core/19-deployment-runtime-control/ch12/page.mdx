# Chapter 12 — CI/CD for AI Systems

AI CI/CD is different because the artifacts are different, the testing is different, and the deployment targets are different. Traditional CI/CD moves small text files through lint, unit tests, integration tests, and deploys to commodity servers. AI CI/CD moves multi-gigabyte binary model files, validates them against eval suites that take minutes or hours, and deploys to GPU clusters with complex orchestration. A Docker image is fifty megabytes. A Llama 4 Scout checkpoint is fourteen gigabytes. A prompt change is three kilobytes. A configuration change is one line. All four artifacts move through different pipelines at different speeds with different risk profiles.

This chapter covers pipeline architecture from commit to production, integration with Section 18 evaluation gates that block promotion until quality thresholds pass, artifact integrity and provenance verification that ensures the model you deploy is the model you tested, artifact promotion rules that only allow registry-sourced deployments after gate pass, approval workflows for high-risk changes, environment progression from dev to staging to production, GitOps with Argo CD and Flux for declarative AI deployments, deployment triggers that balance automation with human judgment, pipeline observability that tracks deployment health in real time, rollback integration that reverts automatically on failure detection, multi-team coordination when five teams need to ship in the same window, and the CI/CD maturity model from bash scripts to self-service platform. By the end, you will have the infrastructure to ship AI changes safely, quickly, and repeatably at scale.

*The best AI CI/CD systems feel like traditional CI/CD until you look closely — then you see eval gates instead of unit tests, artifact registries instead of container registries, and GPU deployments instead of stateless services.*
