# Chapter 2 — Serving Infrastructure and Model Hosting

The foundation of AI deployment is serving infrastructure. Everything else builds on this layer. In 2026, that means understanding vLLM, Text Generation Inference, TensorRT-LLM, and Triton Inference Server. It means container orchestration with GPU-aware scheduling, cold start optimization that doesn't waste 30 seconds on every scale-up event, and model quantization strategies that preserve quality while cutting serving costs by 60%. It means making the build-versus-buy decision between self-hosted infrastructure and managed API endpoints. Get the serving layer wrong and nothing else matters. Your prompts won't save you. Your evals won't save you. Your model selection won't save you. The infrastructure underneath determines what's possible.

This chapter covers the 2026 serving stack from first principles. You'll learn which serving framework fits which workload, how to containerize and orchestrate GPU inference, how to optimize cold starts and model loading, how quantization changes the deployment picture, and when to self-host versus when to pay for managed APIs. By the end, you'll be able to design a serving architecture that actually scales.

*The serving layer is where cost meets performance, where architecture becomes reality, and where most teams discover their assumptions were wrong.*
