# Section 24 — Security & Abuse Prevention

## Chapter 1

### Plain English

This section answers a hard question:

**"How do we prevent AI systems from being exploited, misused, manipulated, or weaponized?"**

In 2026, AI systems are:
- programmable
- networked
- stateful
- autonomous
- high-impact

That makes them **attack surfaces**.

Security is not optional.
Security is architecture.

---

### Why Security Is Different for AI Systems

Traditional software:
- executes deterministic logic
- has known inputs
- fails predictably

AI systems:
- interpret language
- infer intent
- generalize
- interact with tools
- act autonomously

This creates **new classes of abuse**.

---

### Core Principle (2026)

**Assume adversarial users, adversarial inputs, and adversarial environments.**

If you don't design for abuse, someone else will exploit it.

---

### Categories of AI Security Risk

In 2026, AI security risks fall into **six categories**:

1. Prompt-based attacks
2. Tool abuse
3. Data exfiltration
4. Identity & access abuse
5. System abuse & denial
6. Supply chain & dependency risk

Each category requires explicit defense.

---

### 1) Prompt-Based Attacks

Includes:
- prompt injection
- instruction override
- role confusion
- hidden instructions
- jailbreak attempts

Mitigations:
- strict system/policy layers
- input sanitization
- instruction hierarchy enforcement
- refusal rules
- output validation

Never trust user input.

---

### Prompt Injection Defense (2026)

Effective defenses include:
- separating system instructions from user content
- never embedding user text as instructions
- validating tool calls independently
- grounding responses to allowed context only

Prompt injection is a design flaw, not a model flaw.

---

### 2) Tool Abuse

Includes:
- unauthorized tool calls
- privilege escalation
- repeated high-risk actions
- misuse of side effects

Mitigations:
- explicit tool permissions
- least-privilege access
- rate limits per tool
- human approval for sensitive tools
- audit logs

Tools are power. Power must be constrained.

---

### 3) Data Exfiltration & Leakage

Includes:
- leaking private context
- cross-tenant data exposure
- memory poisoning
- training data inference

Mitigations:
- tenant isolation
- strict memory boundaries
- output filtering
- PII detection & redaction
- access-controlled retrieval

Data leaks destroy trust instantly.

---

### 4) Identity & Access Abuse

Includes:
- impersonation
- session hijacking
- replay attacks
- unauthorized access to memory or tools

Mitigations:
- authentication & authorization
- scoped tokens
- session expiry
- role-based access control
- audit trails

AI systems must respect identity boundaries.

---

### 5) System Abuse & Denial

Includes:
- prompt flooding
- cost exhaustion attacks
- latency amplification
- infinite loops via agents

Mitigations:
- rate limits
- quotas
- budget caps
- circuit breakers
- execution timeouts

Abuse often targets economics, not correctness.

---

### 6) Supply Chain & Dependency Risk

Includes:
- compromised models
- unsafe third-party tools
- vendor outages
- malicious updates

Mitigations:
- model approval processes
- dependency reviews
- version pinning
- vendor diversification
- rollback plans

Blind trust in vendors is not security.

---

### Security for RAG Systems

Key risks:
- malicious documents
- prompt injection via retrieved text
- stale or poisoned knowledge

Defenses:
- source vetting
- content sanitization
- grounding enforcement
- citation requirements

RAG turns documents into executable influence.

---

### Security for Agent Systems

Agents amplify risk because they:
- act repeatedly
- make decisions
- call tools autonomously

Defenses:
- action budgets
- step limits
- approval checkpoints
- state inspection
- safe termination rules

Autonomy without limits is dangerous.

---

### Security for Voice Systems

Voice introduces:
- social engineering
- emotional manipulation
- impersonation risk

Defenses:
- identity verification
- consent confirmation
- escalation for sensitive actions
- recording & audit trails

Voice systems must prioritize user safety.

---

### Abuse Detection & Monitoring

Security is not static.

Monitor for:
- unusual prompt patterns
- repeated failures
- abnormal tool usage
- cost spikes
- cross-tenant anomalies

Detection enables prevention.

---

### Redundancy & Defense in Depth

No single defense is enough.

Layer:
- prompt constraints
- tool validation
- output filtering
- rate limiting
- human oversight

Assume some layers will fail.

---

### Incident Response for Security Events

Security incidents require:
- immediate containment
- clear escalation
- user impact assessment
- disclosure decisions
- remediation plans

Silence makes incidents worse.

---

### Governance & Security

Enterprises expect:
- documented threat models
- security reviews
- access logs
- compliance reporting

Security is a leadership responsibility.

---

### Founder Perspective

For founders:
- security enables enterprise trust
- prevents existential incidents
- protects brand
- reduces legal risk

One major security failure can end a company.
