# 3.6 — Multi-Document Synthesis Prompts

A financial services startup lost a $2.8M contract in March 2024 when their AI-powered due diligence tool produced a recommendation memo that contradicted itself across sections. The system had ingested 47 documents about an acquisition target, including financial statements, legal contracts, and market analyses. One section of the output cited Document 12 claiming the target company had "strong IP protection," while another section referenced Document 31 describing "ongoing patent litigation risk." Both statements were technically accurate, but the synthesis prompt had treated each document independently, never forcing the model to reconcile conflicting signals.

The client's investment committee flagged the inconsistency during their review. When the startup's team investigated, they discovered their prompt had instructed the model to "summarize key findings from each document" rather than synthesize across sources. The model had dutifully reported what each document said without integrating the information into a coherent analysis. The client terminated the contract, citing lack of analytical rigor. The root cause was treating multi-document processing as a summarization task rather than a synthesis challenge.

## Synthesis Requires Cross-Document Reasoning

When you prompt a model to work with multiple documents, you face a choice between summarization and synthesis. **Summarization** extracts and reports information from each source independently. **Synthesis** integrates information across sources, reconciles conflicts, identifies patterns, and produces unified conclusions.

Most production failures with multi-document prompts occur because teams write summarization prompts when they need synthesis prompts. A summarization prompt says "review these documents and extract key points." A synthesis prompt says "analyze these documents together, note where they agree or conflict, and form an integrated assessment."

The distinction matters because models default to the easier task. If your prompt is ambiguous, the model will summarize rather than synthesize. You must explicitly instruct cross-document reasoning. Tell the model to compare sources, flag contradictions, and prioritize information based on source quality or recency.

## Document Ordering Controls Attention Patterns

The sequence in which you present documents to the model significantly affects synthesis quality. Models exhibit **recency bias** with long contexts, giving disproportionate weight to information appearing near the end of the prompt. They also show **primacy effects**, treating early documents as framing context for later ones.

You cannot treat document ordering as arbitrary. If you place a low-quality source first, the model may use it as the interpretive lens for higher-quality sources that follow. If you place the most important document last, the model may treat it as an update or correction rather than the authoritative source.

Effective ordering strategies depend on your synthesis goal. For **hierarchical synthesis**, place the most authoritative or comprehensive document first, then add supporting details. For **chronological synthesis**, order documents by date to track changes over time. For **confidence-weighted synthesis**, place high-quality sources first and flag lower-quality sources explicitly in the prompt.

## Provenance Tracking Prevents Attribution Errors

When a model synthesizes information from multiple sources, it can lose track of where specific claims originated. A statement that appeared in Document 3 gets reformulated and presented without attribution. A conclusion that requires evidence from Documents 5, 8, and 12 appears without citation.

**Provenance tracking** means instructing the model to maintain source attribution throughout synthesis. You do this through explicit prompting: "For each claim in your analysis, cite the document number and relevant section." The model must not only synthesize information but also build an audit trail.

The challenge intensifies when the model combines information from multiple sources to support a single conclusion. You need prompts that distinguish between "Document 7 states X" and "Documents 3, 7, and 9 collectively suggest X." The latter requires the model to flag that it is making an inference across sources rather than reporting a single source.

## Contradiction Handling Requires Decision Rules

Real document sets contain contradictions. Financial reports from different quarters show diverging trends. Legal documents include superseded clauses. Market analyses reach opposing conclusions. Your synthesis prompt must tell the model what to do when sources conflict.

The naive approach is to ignore contradictions and hope the model resolves them intelligently. This fails because models lack decision rules for weighing conflicting evidence. One run might favor the first source, another run might favor the last source, and neither choice reflects reasoned judgment.

Effective synthesis prompts include explicit **contradiction handling instructions**. Tell the model to flag conflicts rather than silently choosing one version. Provide decision rules: "When financial documents conflict, prioritize the most recent audited statement." Specify confidence language: "When sources disagree, present both positions and note the conflict."

For critical applications, instruct the model to treat contradictions as synthesis failures requiring human review. A prompt that says "if sources provide materially different figures, do not attempt to reconcile them, instead report both values and flag for manual review" prevents the model from making consequential judgment calls without human oversight.

## Relevance Filtering Improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio

When you provide multiple documents to a model, not all information is equally relevant to your synthesis task. A 50-document set might include 5 highly relevant sources, 20 partially relevant sources, and 25 tangentially relevant sources. Asking the model to synthesize all 50 equally produces diluted output.

**Relevance filtering** means instructing the model to weight documents based on their relationship to your synthesis question. You can implement this through two-stage prompting: first pass identifies relevant documents, second pass synthesizes only those documents. Or you can include filtering instructions in a single prompt: "Focus your synthesis on documents that directly address regulatory compliance, treat other documents as background context only."

The key is specificity about what makes a document relevant. Generic instructions like "focus on important information" give the model no decision criteria. Specific instructions like "prioritize documents containing quantitative safety data over general policy statements" provide clear guidance.

## Multi-Document Prompt Structure Follows Synthesis Logic

Effective synthesis prompts use a clear structure that guides the model through cross-document reasoning. The structure typically includes document presentation, synthesis task definition, handling instructions for special cases, and output format specification.

Start with a synthesis task statement that explicitly requires cross-document reasoning: "Analyze the following documents together to produce an integrated assessment of X." Present documents with clear delimiters and identifiers: "Document 1: [content]... Document 2: [content]." Include metadata when relevant: document type, date, author, confidence level.

After document presentation, provide synthesis instructions that address ordering, provenance, contradiction handling, and relevance filtering. Be specific about the reasoning process you want: "First identify areas of agreement across documents, then flag contradictions, finally assess which sources provide the strongest evidence."

End with output format requirements that enforce provenance tracking: "Structure your response with clear headings, cite document numbers for all claims, flag contradictions explicitly." This structure ensures the model treats synthesis as a deliberate analytical process rather than a summarization task.

## Document Length and Count Affect Synthesis Quality

Models have token limits, but synthesis quality degrades well before you hit those limits. A model with a 200K token context window can technically process 100 documents, but synthesis quality drops sharply beyond 20-30 documents. The model's attention mechanisms struggle to maintain cross-document relationships at scale.

You face a trade-off between document coverage and synthesis depth. Including more documents gives the model more information but reduces its ability to reason across sources. Including fewer documents improves synthesis quality but risks missing important information.

Practical strategies include **hierarchical synthesis**, where you first synthesize subsets of documents, then synthesize the syntheses. A 60-document set becomes 6 groups of 10, producing 6 intermediate syntheses, which then feed into a final synthesis. This approach works when document groups have natural clustering by topic, time period, or source type.

## Synthesis Prompts Need Explicit Reasoning Chains

Models can perform multi-document synthesis, but they rarely show their work without prompting. The model might correctly conclude that "sources generally support X but with important caveats from Y and Z," but you do not see how it weighted different sources or resolved conflicts.

**Chain-of-thought synthesis prompts** instruct the model to externalize its reasoning process: "Before producing your final synthesis, first list the key claim from each document, then identify agreements and conflicts, then explain your reasoning for resolving conflicts, finally present your integrated conclusion."

This approach serves two purposes. It improves synthesis quality by forcing the model to follow a structured reasoning process. And it provides transparency, allowing you to audit how the model reached its conclusions. When synthesis output seems wrong, you can trace back through the reasoning chain to identify where the model went astray.

## Domain-Specific Synthesis Requires Specialized Instructions

Legal document synthesis differs from scientific paper synthesis, which differs from financial statement synthesis. Each domain has conventions about how to handle conflicts, weight sources, and structure conclusions. Generic synthesis prompts produce generic output.

For **legal synthesis**, you need instructions about statutory hierarchy, precedent weight, and effective dates. A prompt that says "when statutes and regulations conflict, statutes take precedence" encodes domain knowledge. For **scientific synthesis**, you need instructions about study design quality, sample size, and replication. A prompt that says "weight randomized controlled trials more heavily than observational studies" reflects methodological standards.

Domain expertise manifests in your synthesis instructions. You are not just asking the model to combine information, you are asking it to apply domain-specific reasoning to that combination. The more specialized your domain, the more explicit your synthesis instructions must be.

## Testing Synthesis Prompts Requires Adversarial Document Sets

You cannot evaluate synthesis prompt quality using clean, consistent document sets. Real-world documents contain conflicts, errors, irrelevant information, and varying quality levels. Your test sets must reflect this reality.

Build **adversarial test sets** that include deliberate contradictions, varying source quality, irrelevant documents, and edge cases. Include documents that contradict each other on key facts. Include high-quality and low-quality sources on the same topic. Include documents that are tangentially related but not directly relevant.

Evaluate whether your synthesis prompt correctly flags contradictions rather than silently choosing one version. Check whether it appropriately weights high-quality sources over low-quality sources. Verify that it focuses on relevant documents rather than treating all documents equally. These adversarial tests reveal prompt weaknesses that clean test sets miss.

## Synthesis Output Format Shapes Downstream Usability

The format in which you request synthesis output determines how easily humans can use, verify, and act on that output. A wall of text synthesizing 20 documents is hard to parse and impossible to audit. Structured output with clear sections, source citations, and confidence markers enables effective use.

Specify output format as part of your synthesis prompt: "Structure your synthesis with sections for key findings, areas of agreement, contradictions and conflicts, and overall assessment. For each claim, provide document citations. Flag low-confidence conclusions explicitly."

The format should match your use case. If humans will make decisions based on the synthesis, emphasize clarity and confidence markers. If the synthesis feeds into another system, emphasize structured fields and consistent formatting. If the synthesis requires audit trails, emphasize provenance and reasoning transparency.

## Iterative Synthesis Handles Scale

When document counts exceed what a single synthesis prompt can handle effectively, you need iterative synthesis strategies. Rather than forcing the model to reason across 100 documents simultaneously, you break the task into stages.

**Iterative synthesis** processes documents in batches, synthesizes each batch, then synthesizes the batch syntheses. A 100-document corpus becomes 10 batches of 10 documents each, producing 10 intermediate syntheses, which feed into a final synthesis. Each stage handles a manageable scope, and the final stage operates on pre-synthesized information rather than raw documents.

This approach requires coordination across synthesis stages. Early-stage prompts focus on extracting and organizing information from their batch. Late-stage prompts focus on integrating pre-synthesized information. You must ensure that intermediate outputs preserve provenance so the final synthesis can trace claims back to source documents.
