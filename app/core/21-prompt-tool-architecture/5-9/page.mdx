# 5.9 — Prompt Deprecation and Sunset Policies

An e-learning platform triggered a compliance violation in August 2025 when they deleted a course assessment prompt that 12,000 students were actively using. The team was cleaning up old prompts and assumed the prompt tagged "legacy_assessment_v1" was unused because they'd launched v2 six months earlier. But universities running summer sessions were still on v1, with students mid-term when the prompt disappeared. The system fell back to a generic assessment prompt that didn't match course requirements, invalidating thousands of test scores. The platform had to manually restore results, re-administer exams, and settle contractual penalties with three universities totaling $420K. They had no deprecation process, no usage monitoring, and no sunset timeline. They just deleted code they thought was old.

Prompts don't disappear when you stop using them. They persist in API logs, user workflows, downstream integrations, and organizational processes. **Deprecation and sunset policies** ensure you retire prompts safely without breaking systems or surprising users. Deleting a prompt is not a cleanup task. It's a migration project.

## Why Prompt Deletion Breaks Systems

Prompts have dependencies you can't always see. Other prompts might reference them, external systems might call them, users might have workflows built around them, and documentation might point to them. Deleting a prompt breaks all of these dependencies simultaneously.

Usage might be intermittent or seasonal. A prompt used heavily in Q4 for holiday support might appear unused in July. A prompt for tax calculations looks dormant outside tax season. If you check usage over a two-week window and see zero calls, you might conclude it's safe to delete. Then March arrives and thousands of tax queries fail because the prompt is gone.

Prompts encode institutional knowledge. Even if a prompt isn't actively used, it documents how you solved a particular problem. It shows what instructions worked for a use case. It provides examples for similar future problems. Deleting it erases that knowledge. The next engineer facing a similar challenge has to rediscover solutions instead of learning from history.

Some systems have long transaction lifecycles. A prompt might initiate a conversation that continues for weeks. Deleting the prompt mid-conversation breaks in-progress interactions. Users who started a workflow with prompt v1 need to complete it with prompt v1, not find that v1 disappeared.

## Establishing Deprecation Warnings

Before removing a prompt, deprecate it with clear warnings and timelines. A **deprecated** prompt is still available but marked for future removal. Warnings alert users and dependent systems to migrate away before the prompt disappears.

Add deprecation metadata to your prompt registry. Mark the prompt as deprecated, specify the deprecation date, provide the sunset date when it will be removed, and link to migration guidance. This information should be visible to anyone accessing the prompt.

If your prompts are accessed via APIs, return deprecation headers in responses. Include headers specifying "Deprecated: true," "Sunset-Date: 2026-06-01," and "Migration-URL: https://docs.yourcompany.com/prompt-migration/assessment-v2." Clients can parse these headers and surface warnings to their developers.

Log deprecation warnings when deprecated prompts are called. Include the calling system, timestamp, and prompt version. This creates an audit trail showing who's still using deprecated prompts and needs to migrate. You can proactively contact teams with high usage of soon-to-be-removed prompts.

Surface deprecation warnings in developer tools and documentation. If a developer looks up a deprecated prompt in your documentation, show a prominent notice that it's deprecated with migration instructions. If they access it in your prompt management UI, display a warning banner. Make deprecation impossible to miss.

## Defining Sunset Timelines

Establish minimum deprecation periods before sunset. For internal prompts used only by your team, 30 days might suffice. For prompts exposed to external users or critical systems, require 90-180 days. Give users adequate time to migrate without rushing.

Communicate sunset dates clearly and repeatedly. Announce deprecation when it happens, remind users at 90 days before sunset, at 60 days, at 30 days, at 14 days, and at 7 days. Each reminder should include specific dates, migration paths, and support contact information.

Differentiate between soft sunset and hard sunset. **Soft sunset** means the prompt is removed from documentation and new usage is discouraged, but it remains available for existing users. **Hard sunset** means the prompt is deleted entirely. Plan for soft sunset first, then hard sunset months later if usage drops to zero.

Consider never sunsetting certain prompts. If a prompt is widely used in ways you can't track or if migration cost for users is extremely high relative to your maintenance cost, leave it available indefinitely. Declaring something deprecated doesn't obligate you to delete it. Deprecation warns against new usage; sunset actually removes it.

## Migration Paths and Documentation

Every deprecated prompt needs a clear migration path. Tell users what to use instead, how to switch, what changes they need to make, and where to get help. "This prompt is deprecated" without guidance is not useful.

Provide concrete migration examples. Show side-by-side comparisons of old prompt usage versus new prompt usage. Include code samples if you're deprecating API endpoints. Demonstrate how to achieve the same results with the replacement prompt.

Document breaking changes explicitly. If the new prompt requires different input format, produces different output structure, or has different parameter requirements, spell out these differences. Don't make users discover incompatibilities through errors.

Offer automated migration tools when possible. If you're deprecating assessment_v1 in favor of assessment_v2 and the only difference is parameter naming, provide a script that converts v1 calls to v2 calls. Reducing migration effort increases migration adoption and reduces the number of users still dependent on deprecated prompts at sunset.

## Monitoring Usage During Deprecation Period

Track usage of deprecated prompts daily. Monitor unique callers, total calls, and trends over time. If usage is declining steadily, the sunset is on track. If usage remains constant or increases, you have a problem: users aren't migrating and sunset will break their systems.

Identify high-volume users of deprecated prompts. Reach out directly to teams or customers accounting for most usage. Offer migration assistance, answer questions, and if necessary extend sunset deadlines for critical users who need more time.

Set migration targets. Plan to have 80% of usage migrated 60 days before sunset, 95% migrated 30 days before sunset, and 99% migrated at sunset date. If you're not hitting these targets, extend the timeline or investigate why migration isn't happening.

Be prepared to extend sunset dates if necessary. If you reach sunset date and significant usage remains, you have two choices: proceed with sunset and break those users, or extend the deadline. Unless users ignored multiple warnings and you have no obligation to support them, extending is usually the right choice.

## Handling Downstream Dependencies

Map downstream dependencies before deprecating prompts. Check what other prompts reference this one, what applications call it, what documentation links to it, and what workflows depend on it. Each dependency is a stakeholder in the deprecation process.

Notify dependency owners when you deprecate a prompt they depend on. Don't assume they monitor your changelog. Proactively email them, file tickets in their tracking systems, or have direct conversations. Ensure they know about the deprecation and have time to adapt.

Update dependent prompts as part of your deprecation plan. If prompt B depends on deprecated prompt A, you need to either update prompt B to use the replacement or deprecate prompt B as well. Chains of dependencies require coordinated migration.

Check external integrations carefully. Third-party systems integrating with your prompts might not be under your control or even visible to you. If you expose prompts via public APIs, deprecation communication must reach external developers, not just your internal teams.

## Deprecation for Compliance and Security

Sometimes prompts must be deprecated urgently due to security vulnerabilities or compliance violations. In these cases, you might not be able to offer long deprecation windows. Establish expedited sunset processes for emergency deprecations.

For security-driven deprecations, disable the prompt immediately and provide emergency migration support. A prompt with a prompt injection vulnerability can't stay available for 90 days while users leisurely migrate. Turn it off, provide alternative solutions, and help users migrate on an accelerated timeline.

Document the security or compliance reason for urgent deprecation. Users need to understand why they're being forced to migrate quickly. "We're deprecating this for security reasons" is more compelling than "We're cleaning up old code."

Maintain emergency contact channels during urgent deprecations. If you disable a prompt that users depend on, they need to be able to reach you immediately for help, not wait for email responses or support tickets. Provide real-time support during high-urgency migrations.

## Archiving Versus Deleting

Consider archiving deprecated prompts instead of deleting them. **Archiving** means moving them to a separate storage location where they're no longer active but remain accessible for reference. This preserves institutional knowledge without cluttering active prompt registries.

Archived prompts should be read-only and clearly marked as historical. Include metadata showing when they were active, when they were deprecated, why they were retired, and what replaced them. This creates a historical record of how your prompts evolved.

Make archived prompts searchable but not executable. Developers should be able to find and read old prompts for reference, but they shouldn't be able to accidentally call them in new code. Search returns archived prompts with clear warnings that they're no longer supported.

Set retention policies for archived prompts. Keep them for a defined period (three years, five years, indefinitely) based on compliance requirements and business needs. If prompts contain sensitive data or PII, purge them after the retention period. If they're pure business logic, keep them longer.

## Version Sunsetting Versus Prompt Sunsetting

Distinguish between sunsetting a specific version of a prompt versus sunsetting an entire prompt family. If you deprecate assessment_v1 but assessment_v2 exists, users have a clear migration path. If you deprecate the entire assessment prompt family with no replacement, you're removing functionality.

When deprecating old versions, be explicit about version lifecycle policies. Tell users how long you support each version, when versions are eligible for deprecation, and how much notice you'll provide. Version lifecycle policies set expectations and enable planning.

Consider maintaining two concurrent versions as a standard practice. Always support version N and version N-1. When you release version N+1, deprecate N-1 with adequate notice. This gives users a predictable upgrade cycle and ensures they're never forced to jump multiple versions.

For major prompt rewrites where migration is complex, maintain parallel versions longer. If assessment_v3 requires completely different input format than v2, users might need 6-12 months to migrate their systems. Short deprecation windows for breaking changes create unnecessary friction.

## Communication Strategies

Use multiple communication channels for deprecation notices. Post in changelogs, send emails to registered users, publish on status pages, update documentation, and for critical deprecations, consider in-app notifications or dashboard banners. Different users monitor different channels.

Tailor communication to audience sophistication. Developers need technical details about breaking changes and API differences. Product managers need to understand business impact and timelines. Executives need to know compliance and risk implications. One-size-fits-all communications fail to reach everyone effectively.

Provide FAQ documentation for common deprecation questions. Why is this being deprecated? What should I use instead? What if I can't migrate by the deadline? Can I get an extension? Who do I contact for help? Answering these proactively reduces support load.

Track communication effectiveness. If you send deprecation notices and see no decrease in usage, users either didn't receive the notices or didn't understand them. Investigate and improve your communication approach.

## Rollback Plans for Failed Sunsets

Even with careful planning, sunsets sometimes cause unexpected problems. Systems you didn't know depended on the prompt break. Users who had migrated discover the replacement doesn't fully meet their needs. Critical workflows fail. You need rollback capabilities.

Keep sunset prompts in inactive but restorable state for 30 days after sunset date. Don't immediately delete code and data. Mark them as inactive, remove them from documentation, but keep them in storage where they can be quickly reactivated if needed.

Monitor for increased errors or support requests after sunset. A spike in errors related to the deprecated prompt's domain indicates users are affected. Elevated support tickets asking about the old prompt suggest the migration path wasn't clear enough or the replacement is insufficient.

Have a process for emergency prompt restoration. If sunsetting breaks critical systems, you need to be able to restore the old prompt within hours, not days. Test your restoration process before sunset so you know it works if needed.

Conduct sunset retrospectives. After each major prompt sunset, review what went well and what didn't. Did communication reach everyone? Did users have adequate time? Were migration tools sufficient? Did the timeline work? Learn from each sunset to improve the next one.

## Handling Requests for Unsunset

Users will sometimes request that you unsunset a prompt after it's been removed. They might discover an edge case where the replacement doesn't work, or they might have a legacy system that's hard to update. Define criteria for when you'll honor unsunset requests.

For prompts sunset less than 90 days ago, consider accommodating reasonable unsunset requests if the maintenance burden is low. You likely still have the code, documentation, and institutional knowledge. Restoring it temporarily to give users more migration time might be worth it.

For prompts sunset more than six months ago, be very cautious about unsunset requests. The code might not work with current infrastructure. Dependencies might have changed. Re-introducing old prompts can create technical debt and confusion. Offer alternative solutions instead.

When you do unsunset a prompt, treat it as a newly deprecated prompt with a firm sunset date. Make it very clear this is a temporary accommodation, not a permanent restoration. Set a new sunset date and communicate it explicitly.

## Building Organizational Discipline

Treat prompt deprecation as seriously as API deprecation in public-facing products. The consequences of breaking users are similar whether you're deprecating a REST endpoint or a prompt endpoint. Apply the same rigor and care.

Make deprecation part of normal development planning. When designing a new prompt version, plan the deprecation timeline for the old version. When deciding to build entirely new functionality, decide upfront what happens to the old prompts it replaces. Deprecation planning shouldn't be an afterthought.

Resist the temptation to skip deprecation for "obviously unused" prompts. Check usage data, search for references, ask in team channels. What seems obvious often isn't. Many "definitely unused" prompts turn out to have hidden dependencies discovered only when they're deleted.

Create a deprecation review board for high-impact prompts. Before deprecating prompts used by external customers, multiple product lines, or critical workflows, convene a small group to review the deprecation plan. They verify communication is adequate, timelines are reasonable, and migration paths are clear.

## Metrics for Deprecation Success

Measure how smoothly your deprecations proceed. Track percentage of usage migrated by sunset date, number of urgent rollbacks needed, support ticket volume during deprecation periods, and user satisfaction with migration process.

Low-friction deprecations show most usage migrated before sunset, minimal support burden, few or no rollbacks needed, and positive user feedback about communication and migration tools. High-friction deprecations show significant usage remaining at sunset, support overwhelm, multiple rollbacks, and user complaints.

Use metrics to improve your process. If multiple deprecations in a row result in extended timelines because users didn't migrate, your communication isn't effective or your migration tools are inadequate. If rollbacks are common, you're not doing enough usage validation before sunset.

Benchmark your deprecation timelines against industry standards. Major cloud providers typically give 12-24 months notice for API deprecations. Internal tooling might move faster. Find the right balance for your user base and commitment level.

## The Discipline of Responsible Sunsetting

Prompt sunsetting is the last stage of prompt lifecycle management, but it's not optional or low priority. How you retire prompts affects user trust, system reliability, and your team's credibility. Deleting prompts carelessly is as damaging as deploying broken prompts.

Invest in making deprecation smooth. Good communication, clear migration paths, adequate timelines, and usage monitoring cost effort but prevent disasters. The cost is worth it compared to breaking production systems or losing customer trust.

Normalize that some prompts might never be sunset. If a prompt has widespread usage and no compelling reason to remove it, maintaining it indefinitely is often the right choice. Deprecation is a tool for managing technical debt and evolving your product, not a goal in itself.

Successful prompt sunset happens when the sunset date arrives and nobody notices because everyone already migrated. That's the goal: well-communicated, well-timed, well-supported transitions that feel inevitable rather than disruptive. It's achievable with discipline and care.

As you build sophisticated lifecycle management for individual prompts, you'll discover that many prompts share common patterns and components. Understanding how to build reusable prompt libraries that serve multiple products efficiently requires thinking about prompts as modular, composable assets rather than isolated artifacts.
