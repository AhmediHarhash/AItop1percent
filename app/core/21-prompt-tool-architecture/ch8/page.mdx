# Chapter 8 — Structured Output, Parsing, and Production Patterns

Unstructured output is a debugging nightmare. Structured output — JSON schemas, typed fields, validated formats — enables automation, reliable parsing, and downstream consumption. This chapter covers schema enforcement, streaming structured data, validation gates, and fallback patterns when outputs fail.
