# Section 13 — Release Gates & Shipping Discipline

## Chapter 1

### Plain English

Release gates answer one question:

**"Are we allowed to ship this?"**

Not:
- "Does it work on my machine?"
- "Did we improve something?"
- "Are we excited?"

But:
- Is it safe?
- Is it reliable?
- Is it worth the risk?
- Can we roll it back?

In 2026, **shipping is a controlled decision**, not a technical event.

### Why Release Gates Exist

AI systems are:
- probabilistic
- opaque
- sensitive to small changes
- capable of large blast radius failures

Without gates:
- regressions ship silently
- safety erodes
- cost explodes
- trust collapses

Release gates turn **uncertainty into managed risk**.

---

### What a Release Gate Actually Is

A release gate is:
- a predefined checklist
- backed by measurable signals
- tied to ownership
- enforced by process (not vibes)

If a gate fails:
- the release stops
- no exceptions
- no heroics

This is discipline, not bureaucracy.

---

### The Three Classes of Release Gates (2026)

#### 1) Hard Gates (Non-Negotiable)

If these fail, **nothing ships**.

Examples:
- safety violations
- grounding failures
- PII leakage
- critical latency breaches
- security issues

Hard gates protect users and the company.

---

#### 2) Soft Gates (Judgment Required)

Failures trigger:
- review
- discussion
- tradeoff decisions

Examples:
- slight quality regressions
- minor latency increase
- small cost increase

Soft gates require **explicit sign-off**.

---

#### 3) Informational Gates

Used for:
- awareness
- trend tracking
- future planning

Examples:
- experimental metrics
- early signals
- exploratory evals

Informational gates never block shipping.

---

### What Signals Feed Release Gates

Release gates are fed by:
- offline evals
- regression tests
- human reviews
- production monitoring (for rollouts)
- cost analysis
- security checks

A gate without data is theater.

---

### Typical Gate Criteria (Examples)

#### Quality Gates
- no regression on golden set
- no increase in hallucination rate
- grounding accuracy above threshold

#### Safety Gates
- zero critical violations
- refusal behavior unchanged or improved

#### Performance Gates
- p95 latency within budget
- no timeout increase

#### Cost Gates
- cost per task within limits
- no tool-call explosion

---

### Release Gates for Different Systems

#### Chat Systems
- refusal correctness
- usefulness regression
- tone stability

#### RAG Systems
- grounding accuracy
- citation correctness
- retrieval stability

#### Agent Systems
- task completion rate
- loop rate
- recovery behavior

#### Voice Systems
- latency hard caps
- interruption handling
- silence thresholds

Each system needs **custom gates**.

### Gating in CI/CD (2026 Standard)

In mature systems:
- gates are automated
- failures block deploy
- humans intervene only when needed

CI/CD gates are:
- reproducible
- logged
- auditable

No "just this once" deploys.

---

### Progressive Release Strategies

Shipping is rarely binary.

Common patterns:
- canary releases
- percentage rollouts
- shadow deployments
- feature flags

Gates apply at **each stage**, not just the start.

---

### Rollback Discipline

A release is incomplete without rollback.

Rollback requires:
- previous version preserved
- fast redeploy
- clear ownership
- rehearsed process

If rollback is scary, release gates are weak.

---

### Ownership and Accountability

Every gate has:
- an owner
- a decision-maker
- a documented rationale

If something goes wrong:
- decisions are traceable
- lessons are learned
- trust is preserved

---

### Enterprise Expectations

Enterprises expect:
- predictable releases
- documented approval
- minimal surprises
- clear accountability

Release discipline is a selling point.

---

### Founder Perspective

For founders:
- release gates reduce panic
- allow faster iteration safely
- protect brand trust
- make scaling possible

Fast teams ship safely.
Reckless teams ship once.

---

### Common Failure Modes

- shipping on vibes
- ignoring soft gate failures
- changing gates mid-release
- no rollback plan
- over-gating trivial changes

Discipline must be balanced, not rigid.

---

### Interview-Grade Talking Points

You should be able to explain:

- why gates exist
- hard vs soft gates
- how gates differ by system
- how progressive rollout works
- why rollback is mandatory

This is **Staff / Lead / Principal thinking**.

---

### Completion Checklist

You are done with this section when you can:

- define release gates for any AI system
- explain which gates block shipping
- explain how gates integrate with CI/CD
- explain rollout and rollback strategies
- explain ownership and accountability

If this feels obvious, you're operating at a high level.

### What Comes Next

Now that shipping is disciplined, the next challenge is:

**How do we proactively break our own systems before others do?**

That is Section 14 — Red Teaming & Adversarial Testing.
