# Chapter 5 — Fine-Tuning Infrastructure and Platforms

Infrastructure choices for fine-tuning range from managed API solutions to fully self-hosted training clusters, each with different cost, flexibility, and lock-in tradeoffs. Using OpenAI or Google's managed APIs means you pay per request and gain simplicity, but you lose control over training parameters and cannot audit how your data is handled. Self-hosting gives you full visibility and control but requires DevOps expertise, GPU provisioning, and responsibility for all infrastructure. Between these extremes lie managed platforms like Together.ai and Modal that offer controlled pricing without the operational burden of self-hosting.

This chapter guides you through each infrastructure path: the OpenAI and Google fine-tuning APIs, managed open-model platforms, and self-hosted training with industry-standard frameworks. You will learn how to size GPU clusters, choose between cloud providers based on cost and availability, set up multi-GPU training at scale, implement experiment tracking and reproducibility, manage checkpointing and failure recovery, and maintain security and isolation for sensitive training data. The infrastructure decision is a two-year commitment disguised as a weekend decision.
