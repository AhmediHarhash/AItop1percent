# Chapter 8 — Cost, ROI, and the Business Case for Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning is an investment with multiple cost centers: training costs up front, lower inference costs per request, ongoing maintenance tax as models drift and data becomes stale, and opportunity costs of capital tied up in infrastructure. Most teams cannot articulate the return on investment, which is why most fine-tuning projects lose funding when initial enthusiasm fades and the spreadsheet numbers do not justify the effort.

This chapter teaches you how to build the financial model that makes fine-tuning ROI explicit and defensible. You will learn how to estimate training costs across different infrastructure choices and data sizes, calculate the inference cost savings from deploying smaller fine-tuned models instead of expensive API calls to frontier models, determine the volume threshold where fine-tuning becomes financially positive, factor in quality gains and error reduction as measurable business impact, understand the maintenance tax that every fine-tuned model incurs over time, and run a three-way cost comparison between building a custom model from scratch, buying a pre-built model, and fine-tuning an existing foundation. The chapter includes a step-by-step financial model that you can customize for your business and guidance on how to present the business case to non-technical stakeholders who control budget allocation.

*If you cannot explain why fine-tuning pays for itself in a single spreadsheet, you do not have a business case. You have a science experiment.*
