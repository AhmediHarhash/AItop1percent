# 6.4 — Financial Domain: Earnings Reports, Risk Analysis, and Compliance Language

Fine-tuning financial models is not a machine learning problem disguised as regulatory compliance. It is a regulatory compliance problem that happens to use machine learning. Most teams get this backwards. They train on financial text because it improves accuracy metrics. They celebrate ROUGE scores. They deploy models that generate fluent, readable summaries. Then compliance, legal, or regulators shut them down because the model used a phrase like "guaranteed returns" or omitted a required risk disclosure or cited data that cannot be traced to an authoritative source. The regulatory framework for financial communications was built over decades to prevent exactly the kinds of confident, plausible, misleading statements that fine-tuned language models naturally produce. If you approach financial domain adaptation as a text generation task, you will fail. If you approach it as compliance automation with machine learning as the implementation tool, you might succeed.

The root cause was not the model architecture or the fine-tuning technique. The team had trained on financial text, but they had trained on the wrong corpus. Financial journalism optimizes for readability and narrative flow. It uses approximations, metaphors, and editorial voice. Regulated financial communications operate under a completely different set of constraints. Earnings reports, risk disclosures, and compliance language exist in a legal framework where every word carries potential liability. A phrase that sounds authoritative in a blog post becomes a violation when it appears in a client-facing document without the required hedging, attribution, and risk warnings. Fine-tuning for financial domains is not about teaching the model finance. It is about teaching the model the language of regulated finance, where precision and defensibility matter more than clarity or engagement.

## The Financial Language Constraint Surface

Financial domain adaptation operates under constraints that are stricter and more expensive than almost any other vertical. You are not just optimizing for accuracy. You are optimizing for legal defensibility, regulatory compliance, and audit trail integrity. When a healthcare model generates an incorrect diagnosis suggestion, the harm is contained to clinical workflow. When a financial model generates an incorrect statement about portfolio performance or risk exposure, the harm can cascade through client relationships, regulatory examinations, shareholder litigation, and criminal investigations under securities fraud statutes.

The first constraint is numerical precision. Financial models must handle numbers with exact correctness. A base model might paraphrase "the fund returned 8.47 percent" as "the fund returned approximately eight and a half percent" because that transformation preserves semantic meaning in most contexts. In financial reporting, it does not. The difference between 8.47 percent and 8.5 percent is three basis points, and in performance reporting those three basis points can determine fee tiers, benchmark comparisons, and compliance with advertised return targets. Fine-tuning for finance means training the model to treat numerical values as immutable tokens that must be reproduced exactly as they appear in source data.

The second constraint is attribution and sourcing. Every factual claim in a financial document must be traceable to an authoritative source. A model trained on general financial news might generate a sentence like "the company's revenue growth accelerated in Q3" based on pattern recognition across similar companies. In a regulated report, that sentence is a compliance violation unless it cites the specific earnings release, SEC filing, or investor presentation where the revenue figures were disclosed. Fine-tuning for finance means teaching the model to generate citations, to distinguish between management statements and independent analysis, and to flag when it is extrapolating beyond what the source data explicitly supports.

The third constraint is risk disclosure language. Financial regulations require specific warnings, disclaimers, and hedge phrases whenever performance data, forward-looking statements, or investment characteristics are discussed. A model that generates "this strategy has consistently outperformed benchmarks over five years" without immediately following with past performance disclaimers and risk warnings is generating legally non-compliant text. Fine-tuning for finance means embedding regulatory templates into the model's generation patterns so that risk language appears automatically in the correct positions.

## Training Data for Financial Fine-Tuning

The most common mistake in financial domain adaptation is training on publicly available financial content. The internet is full of financial text: news articles, analyst reports, blog posts, social media commentary, earnings call transcripts, and SEC filings. Most of it is useless for fine-tuning a production financial model, and some of it is actively harmful.

Financial journalism is optimized for a different objective function than financial reporting. Journalists write to inform and engage readers. They use narrative structure, colorful language, and editorial interpretation. A Bloomberg article might describe a CEO as "struggling to convince investors" or characterize a quarter as "disappointing despite meeting guidance." That language is appropriate in journalism. It is completely inappropriate in a client-facing financial report, where characterizations must be neutral and tied to objective criteria. If you fine-tune on financial journalism, the model learns journalistic voice, not reporting voice.

Analyst reports from investment banks and research firms are better, but they carry their own problems. Sell-side analysts write to support their firm's banking relationships and trading desks. Their language is often promotional, selectively emphasizing positive developments while downplaying risks. They use phrases like "strong buy" and "compelling valuation" that are subjective judgments, not objective descriptions. If you fine-tune on analyst reports, the model learns to generate opinions, not facts.

The correct training corpus for financial fine-tuning comes from three sources. First, regulatory filings: 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, proxy statements, and registration statements filed with the SEC. These documents use the language of compliance. They are written by lawyers and accountants who understand liability. They include required disclosures, standardized risk warnings, and precise numerical formatting. Second, audited financial statements and footnotes. These documents have been reviewed by external auditors and carry the firm's attestation that the numbers are fairly presented under GAAP or IFRS. Third, compliance-reviewed client communications from regulated financial institutions. These are prospectuses, fact sheets, performance reports, and account statements that have already passed through legal and compliance review.

You need examples of both good and bad financial writing. A fine-tuning dataset should include annotated examples where non-compliant language is marked and corrected. For instance, a training example might show an original draft that says "the portfolio is well-positioned for growth" and the compliance-reviewed version that says "the portfolio has increased its allocation to equity securities, which historically exhibit higher volatility and potential for capital appreciation than fixed income securities, as described in the risk disclosures on page twelve." The model learns not just what compliant language looks like, but what transformations are required to move from draft to compliant.

## Earnings Analysis Fine-Tuning

Earnings analysis is one of the most valuable and most dangerous applications of fine-tuned financial models. The task is to take a company's quarterly earnings release, compare it to prior quarters and analyst expectations, and generate a summary of key metrics and trends. A well-tuned model can process hundreds of earnings releases per day and surface the metrics that matter for investment decisions. A poorly-tuned model generates summaries that are factually wrong, misleading, or legally problematic.

The core challenge in earnings fine-tuning is teaching the model to distinguish between reported numbers and adjusted numbers. Companies report earnings under GAAP, but they also present non-GAAP adjusted earnings that exclude certain items like restructuring charges, acquisition costs, or stock-based compensation. The relationship between GAAP and non-GAAP figures is a constant source of confusion and manipulation. A company might report a GAAP loss but an adjusted profit, or GAAP revenue growth of three percent but adjusted revenue growth of twelve percent after excluding divestitures. The model must learn to present both figures, explain the reconciliation, and avoid giving primacy to the adjusted figures without context.

Fine-tuning for earnings analysis requires training data that shows correct handling of GAAP versus non-GAAP metrics. Each training example should include the earnings release, the comparison periods, and a gold-standard summary that presents both GAAP and adjusted figures with appropriate labeling. The summary should highlight when adjusted figures exclude large or recurring items, and it should flag when the company changes its non-GAAP definition between quarters, making period-over-period comparisons misleading.

Another key pattern is year-over-year versus sequential comparisons. Revenue might be up eight percent year-over-year but down two percent sequentially. Both comparisons are meaningful, but they tell different stories. A fine-tuned model needs to present both and explain when one is more relevant than the other. For seasonal businesses, year-over-year comparisons are more informative. For businesses with strong momentum or recent inflection points, sequential comparisons matter more. The model should learn these patterns from training data that includes annotated examples of when each comparison type is emphasized.

Forward guidance is the highest-risk element of earnings analysis. Companies provide guidance about expected future revenue, earnings, or margins. A model summary might include a sentence like "management raised full-year revenue guidance to a range of four point two to four point four billion dollars." That sentence is factually correct, but it is incomplete. Compliant earnings analysis must immediately follow any forward guidance with a disclaimer that guidance reflects management's current expectations, is subject to risks and uncertainties, and may not be achieved. The fine-tuning dataset must include examples where guidance is always paired with disclaimer language so the model learns this as a required pattern.

## Risk Analysis and Disclosure Generation

Risk analysis is the most compliance-sensitive application of financial fine-tuning. The task is to read a portfolio, a financial product, or an investment strategy and generate appropriate risk disclosures. The stakes are extreme. If the model understates risk, clients make uninformed decisions and the firm faces liability. If the model overstates risk, the product becomes unsellable. The model must generate risk language that is accurate, comprehensive, and calibrated to the actual risk level.

Risk disclosure fine-tuning starts with a taxonomy of risk types. Equity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, and regulatory risk are distinct categories, each with its own standard disclosure patterns. A fine-tuned model needs to recognize which risks are present in a given portfolio and generate the corresponding disclosures. This requires training data where portfolios are mapped to applicable risk categories and each category is associated with compliant disclosure text.

The second layer is risk magnitude calibration. Not all equity exposure carries the same risk. A portfolio of large-cap U.S. equities has lower volatility than a portfolio of small-cap emerging market equities, and the risk disclosures should reflect that difference. Fine-tuning for risk analysis means teaching the model to assess portfolio characteristics like market cap, geographic concentration, sector concentration, and historical volatility, and to adjust the strength of risk language accordingly. A training example might show two portfolios with different equity allocations and demonstrate how the risk disclosure language intensifies as volatility measures increase.

Regulatory risk disclosures have required elements that must appear in specific formats. For mutual funds, the SEC requires a standardized risk/return summary with specific sections in a specific order. For variable annuities, FINRA requires specific language about surrender charges, fees, and tax treatment. Fine-tuning for compliance means embedding these templates into the model so it generates required sections automatically. The training data should include complete examples of compliant documents, not just isolated paragraphs, so the model learns document structure and section ordering.

A critical pattern is the distinction between generic and specific risks. Every financial product has generic risks that apply to the asset class: stocks are volatile, bonds have interest rate risk, derivatives have counterparty risk. But many products also have specific risks tied to their particular structure or strategy. A fund that concentrates in a single sector has sector-specific risk. A fund that uses leverage has amplified loss risk. A structured product with a barrier feature has knock-in risk. The model must learn to generate both generic and specific disclosures, and to ensure that specific risks are called out prominently rather than buried in generic boilerplate.

## Compliance Language and Regulatory Constraints

Compliance language generation is the most constrained form of financial writing. The model is not writing to inform or persuade. It is writing to satisfy a legal requirement. Every word must align with regulatory guidance, industry standards, and the firm's compliance policies. The cost of an error is not user dissatisfaction. It is regulatory enforcement, fines, and consent orders.

The first principle of compliance fine-tuning is conservatism. When the model is uncertain about whether a phrase is compliant, it should default to more conservative, more verbose, more hedged language. A base model might generate "this fund invests in growth stocks" as a concise summary. A compliance-tuned model should generate "this fund seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of companies that the portfolio manager believes have above-average growth potential, which may result in higher volatility and greater risk of loss than more diversified or value-oriented strategies." The second version is wordier, but it is defensible.

Compliance tuning requires negative examples. The training data should include examples of non-compliant language with annotations explaining why it is problematic and what the compliant alternative is. For instance, an example might show "guaranteed returns" marked as non-compliant because no investment can be guaranteed outside of specific instruments like CDs or government bonds, with the compliant alternative being "the product seeks to provide" or "the strategy targets." The model learns not just what to write, but what to avoid.

Another key element is version control and regulatory updates. Financial regulations change constantly. The SEC updates disclosure rules, FINRA issues new guidance, and state regulators impose additional requirements. A compliance-tuned model must be retrained when regulations change, and the retraining process must be documented for audit purposes. Your fine-tuning pipeline should include a process for tracking regulatory changes, identifying which disclosures are affected, updating the training data, and revalidating the model against the new requirements.

Firms should maintain a compliance review layer even when using fine-tuned models. The model generates draft disclosures, but a human compliance professional reviews and approves them before publication. This review step is not a sign that the model is unreliable. It is a control that ensures accountability. The model's role is to reduce the compliance team's workload by generating high-quality drafts that require minimal editing, not to eliminate human review entirely.

## Evaluation and Validation for Financial Models

Evaluating a fine-tuned financial model is different from evaluating a general-purpose language model. You are not measuring fluency or coherence. You are measuring compliance, accuracy, and defensibility. The evaluation dataset must include adversarial examples designed to test edge cases and failure modes.

Numerical accuracy testing is foundational. The evaluation set should include documents with tables of financial data, and the model's summaries should be checked for exact reproduction of numbers. A single transposed digit, a misplaced decimal point, or an incorrect unit (millions versus billions) is a failure. Automated testing should compare every number in the model's output against the source document and flag any discrepancies.

Compliance coverage testing checks whether required disclosures are present. For each document type, you define a checklist of required elements: risk warnings, performance disclaimers, fee disclosures, liquidity terms, tax considerations. The evaluation script parses the model's output and verifies that each required element appears. Missing a required disclosure is an automatic failure, regardless of how well-written the rest of the document is.

Attribution testing verifies that factual claims are sourced. The evaluation process should include a step where a human reviewer or a second model checks whether each claim in the output can be traced to a specific sentence or table in the source document. Claims that appear to be inferred, extrapolated, or introduced from the model's training data are flagged as unsourced and treated as failures.

Adversarial testing introduces edge cases designed to trigger compliance violations. Examples include earnings releases with large non-GAAP adjustments, portfolios with exotic derivatives, and products with complex fee structures. The model should handle these cases conservatively, either by generating appropriate detailed disclosures or by flagging the case as requiring human review.

You should also test for prohibited language. The evaluation set should include a list of phrases that are never acceptable in financial communications: "guaranteed," "risk-free," "can't lose," "always outperforms," and similar absolutes. The model should never generate these phrases, even when paraphrasing or summarizing content that uses them.

## Cost and ROI of Financial Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning for financial applications is expensive, but the ROI can be substantial if the use case is high-volume and the quality bar is met. The cost comes from data curation, legal and compliance review of training data, ongoing retraining as regulations change, and the operational overhead of maintaining audit trails.

Data curation is the largest upfront cost. You need thousands of examples of compliant financial documents, and each example must be reviewed to ensure it meets current regulatory standards. If you are training on historical documents, you must verify that the disclosure language was compliant at the time and remains compliant today. Regulations tighten over time, so a disclosure that was acceptable in 2022 might be insufficient in 2026. Expect to spend six to twelve months and invest between three hundred thousand and one million dollars in data preparation for a production-grade financial fine-tuning effort.

Ongoing retraining costs are significant. Financial regulations change quarterly. The SEC releases new guidance, FINRA updates exam priorities, and state regulators impose new requirements. Each change requires evaluating whether the model's training data and outputs remain compliant, updating examples if needed, and retraining. Plan for quarterly retraining cycles with a budget of fifty to one hundred thousand dollars per cycle.

The ROI comes from labor displacement and risk reduction. A wealth management firm with ten thousand clients might generate forty thousand quarterly performance reports per year. If each report requires thirty minutes of human effort to draft and review, that is twenty thousand hours annually. A fine-tuned model that can generate compliant drafts in seconds reduces that to five thousand hours of human review time, saving fifteen thousand hours at a loaded cost of one hundred fifty dollars per hour, or two point two five million dollars per year. The model pays for itself in the first year.

Risk reduction ROI is harder to quantify but potentially larger. A single material compliance violation can result in fines in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, plus reputational harm and increased regulatory scrutiny. A fine-tuned model that consistently generates compliant disclosures reduces the frequency of violations, and the avoided cost of even one enforcement action can justify the entire fine-tuning investment.

## The Liability and Accountability Model

When a fine-tuned financial model generates incorrect or non-compliant content, the liability falls on the firm, not the model vendor. This is a critical difference from consumer applications. If a chatbot gives bad restaurant recommendations, the user is annoyed. If a financial model gives bad investment disclosures, the firm is liable for securities violations.

This liability model shapes how you deploy financial models. You must maintain human accountability at every step. The model is a tool used by compliance, legal, and finance professionals, not a replacement for them. The professional reviews the model's output, edits it if necessary, and approves it for publication. Their approval carries the same legal weight as if they had written the document themselves.

You must also maintain audit trails. Every model-generated document should be logged with metadata including the model version, the input data, the generation timestamp, the reviewer who approved it, and the approval timestamp. If a regulator questions a disclosure three years later, you must be able to reconstruct exactly how it was generated and who approved it. This audit trail requirement adds operational complexity, but it is not optional in regulated environments.

Training and competency requirements apply to the humans using the model. A junior associate cannot simply approve whatever the model generates. The reviewer must have the expertise to evaluate whether the output is compliant, accurate, and appropriate. Firms should document the qualifications of personnel who are authorized to approve model-generated financial communications and should provide training on how to review and edit model outputs effectively.

Finally, you must have a process for handling model errors. When a non-compliant document is generated and caught in review, the error should be logged, analyzed, and used to improve the model. When a non-compliant document is not caught and reaches clients or regulators, the firm must have an incident response process that includes pulling the document, notifying affected parties, filing required regulatory reports, and documenting corrective actions. The existence of this process is often reviewed in regulatory exams, and the absence of it is a red flag.

Fine-tuning for financial domains is not a machine learning problem. It is a regulatory compliance problem that happens to use machine learning as an implementation technique. The firms that succeed treat it as such, embedding compliance expertise into every stage of the fine-tuning lifecycle from data curation through deployment and monitoring. The firms that fail treat it as a text generation problem and discover too late that financial text generation is a regulated activity with criminal and civil penalties for errors.

The next challenge is code generation, where the evaluation framework shifts from compliance to executability and correctness, and where the model's ability to understand repository context determines whether it produces helpful tools or creates technical debt.
