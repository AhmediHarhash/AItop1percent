# 6.9 — Domain-Specific Evaluation Suites: Building Benchmarks That Matter

In early 2025, a financial services firm deployed a fine-tuned model to generate equity research reports summarizing quarterly earnings calls. The team evaluated the model using standard NLP benchmarks: ROUGE scores, perplexity, and semantic similarity against reference summaries. The model achieved ROUGE-L of 0.72, well above their target of 0.65. They launched to 200 internal analysts. Within three weeks, analysts reported serious issues. The model frequently miscalculated percentage changes in revenue and earnings. It confused GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. It missed forward guidance buried in Q&A sections. It sometimes hallucinated analyst estimates that did not exist. The generic NLP metrics had missed all of this because they measured surface-level text similarity, not financial accuracy. The team had to pull the model offline, build a domain-specific evaluation suite with 15 financial accuracy checks, and retrain. They learned that evaluating domain-adapted models with generic benchmarks is professional negligence. You need evaluation suites that measure what domain experts care about: factual accuracy, reasoning validity, compliance with domain rules, and appropriate expression of uncertainty.

## Why Generic Benchmarks Are Insufficient

Generic NLP benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, and standard question-answering datasets measure general language understanding. They test whether models can parse grammar, resolve coreference, understand common sense, and answer factual questions about general knowledge. These capabilities are necessary for domain tasks but not sufficient.

A model can score 95 percent on MMLU and still fail at contract review because MMLU does not test legal reasoning. It can ace reading comprehension benchmarks and still fail at radiology report generation because those benchmarks do not test medical terminology or diagnostic logic. It can perform well on math word problems and still fail at financial analysis because word problems do not test understanding of accounting standards or valuation formulas.

Domain tasks require domain-specific knowledge and reasoning. Legal models must know jurisdictional differences, statutory interpretation rules, and case law precedents. Medical models must know disease pathophysiology, drug interactions, and clinical guidelines. Financial models must know accounting standards, market conventions, and regulatory requirements. Code models must know language-specific idioms, library APIs, and architectural patterns. Generic benchmarks do not test any of this.

Domain tasks also require domain-specific output quality. A legal memo must cite correct authorities, apply correct legal tests, and hedge appropriately. A medical diagnosis must consider differential diagnoses, weigh evidence systematically, and avoid contraindicated treatments. A financial analysis must use correct formulas, source data from correct fields, and disclose assumptions. Generic text generation metrics do not measure any of these quality dimensions. They measure whether generated text looks like reference text, not whether it is correct according to domain standards.

You need domain-specific evaluation suites that test the knowledge, reasoning, and output quality that matter in your domain. These suites are not published benchmarks. You build them yourself using domain expertise.

## Building Domain-Specific Test Sets

The foundation of a domain evaluation suite is a test set of inputs and reference outputs curated by domain experts. These are not random examples. They are carefully selected cases that cover the range of scenarios the model will encounter in production and the range of failure modes you want to prevent.

Start by defining coverage dimensions. For legal contract review, coverage dimensions might include contract type, jurisdiction, clause complexity, and risk severity. You want test cases spanning multiple contract types, multiple jurisdictions, simple and complex clauses, and low-risk and high-risk provisions. For medical diagnosis, coverage dimensions might include chief complaint, patient demographics, symptom severity, and diagnostic ambiguity. You want test cases spanning common and rare complaints, diverse patient populations, mild and severe symptoms, and clear-cut and ambiguous cases.

Recruit domain experts to create test cases. Each test case includes an input and one or more reference outputs. For contract review, the input is a contract clause or full contract, and the reference output is an expert-written analysis. For medical diagnosis, the input is a clinical vignette, and the reference output is an expert diagnosis with reasoning. For financial analysis, the input is company financial data, and the reference output is an expert-written analysis or valuation.

Quality matters more than quantity. A test set of 200 carefully curated cases with high-quality reference outputs is more valuable than 2,000 random cases with mediocre references. Each case should be representative of real-world scenarios. Each reference output should reflect best practices. If your reference outputs are inconsistent or low-quality, your evaluation results will be meaningless.

Include adversarial cases. These are inputs designed to expose common failure modes. For legal models, include contracts with ambiguous language, conflicting clauses, or unusual jurisdictional issues. For medical models, include cases with overlapping symptoms, rare diseases, or incomplete patient histories. For financial models, include companies with non-standard accounting, recent M&A activity, or reporting irregularities. Adversarial cases test whether the model handles edge cases appropriately or fails dangerously.

Include temporal diversity. Domains evolve. Legal test sets should include recent case law and statutes, not just historical ones. Medical test sets should include current treatment guidelines, not outdated protocols. Financial test sets should include current accounting standards, not old rules. If your test set is static and your domain evolves, your evaluation becomes stale. Plan to refresh test sets annually or quarterly depending on domain pace of change.

Version your test sets. As you identify new failure modes, add cases covering them. As domain standards change, update reference outputs. Track which model version was evaluated on which test set version. This maintains eval continuity: you can compare model v2 to model v1 on the same test set, and you can compare model v3 to model v2 on an updated test set that reflects new domain requirements.

## Expert-Validated Golden Sets

Not all test cases are equally important. Some represent common scenarios where errors are low-stakes. Others represent critical scenarios where errors are catastrophic. You need a subset of high-priority cases with expert-validated reference outputs. This is your golden set.

Golden sets are small, typically 50 to 200 cases, but they receive disproportionate attention. Each case is reviewed by multiple senior domain experts to ensure the reference output is unambiguously correct. Each case is weighted by importance: critical cases have higher weight than routine cases. The model's performance on the golden set is your primary quality metric.

For medical models, golden set cases might include common but serious conditions like myocardial infarction, stroke, and sepsis. These are high-frequency, high-stakes diagnoses where errors cause patient harm. For legal models, golden set cases might include standard clauses that appear in 80 percent of contracts: liability caps, indemnification, and termination rights. These are high-frequency clauses where errors affect deal outcomes. For financial models, golden set cases might include standard valuation scenarios for profitable companies with clean financials. These are the bread-and-butter cases the model must handle flawlessly.

Golden sets also include known failure modes from previous model versions. If v1 of your model struggled with force majeure clauses, include force majeure cases in the golden set for v2. If v1 confused atrial fibrillation with atrial flutter, include AFib and AFlutter cases in the v2 golden set. The golden set becomes a regression test: new model versions must not reintroduce old failures.

Track golden set performance over time. Every model version is evaluated on the same golden set using the same metrics. You should see monotonic improvement: each new version should score at least as well as the previous version, ideally better. If performance degrades, block the release and investigate. Regression on the golden set means you broke something critical.

Use golden set performance as a deployment gate. Define minimum acceptable accuracy on the golden set: for example, 95 percent correctness on critical cases, 90 percent on important cases, 85 percent on routine cases. Do not deploy models that fail to meet these thresholds. The golden set is your quality bar.

## Automated Domain Metrics

Expert review does not scale to thousands of outputs per day. You need automated metrics that approximate expert judgment. These metrics are domain-specific: they check for patterns that correlate with correctness in your domain.

For legal models, automated metrics might include citation validity, legal terminology precision, and clause coverage. Citation validity checks whether cited cases and statutes exist and are correctly formatted. Legal terminology precision checks whether the model uses terms like "force majeure," "indemnification," and "material breach" correctly. Clause coverage checks whether the model's analysis addresses all critical clauses in the input contract. None of these metrics guarantee correctness, but they filter out outputs with obvious errors.

For medical models, automated metrics might include diagnostic terminology accuracy, contraindication detection, and guideline compliance. Terminology accuracy checks whether the model uses ICD-10 codes, drug names, and procedure names correctly. Contraindication detection checks whether recommended treatments are contraindicated given the patient's conditions or allergies. Guideline compliance checks whether recommendations align with published clinical guidelines. These metrics catch dangerous errors like prescribing a drug the patient is allergic to.

For financial models, automated metrics might include calculation accuracy, formula validity, and source data traceability. Calculation accuracy checks whether computed metrics like EPS, P/E ratio, and revenue growth match recomputed values from source data. Formula validity checks whether the model applied formulas correctly: for example, enterprise value equals market cap plus debt minus cash. Source data traceability checks whether the model sourced numbers from the correct financial statement line items. These metrics catch errors like adding when you should subtract.

For code models, automated metrics might include syntax validity, import correctness, and function signature matching. Syntax validity runs generated code through a parser to check for syntax errors. Import correctness checks whether imported libraries exist and are used correctly. Function signature matching checks whether function calls use the correct argument types and counts. These metrics catch code that will not compile or run.

Build your automated metrics iteratively. Start with simple heuristics: check for required keywords, flag missing sections, verify numeric ranges. Then add more sophisticated checks: use regex to validate citations, use lookup tables to validate terminology, use symbolic execution to verify calculations. Finally, add learned metrics: train small classifiers to predict expert ratings based on output features. Learned metrics are more accurate than heuristics but require labeled data.

Calibrate automated metrics against expert ratings. Evaluate a sample of outputs using both automated metrics and expert review. Measure correlation: which automated metrics best predict expert correctness ratings. Use high-correlation metrics as primary metrics. Use low-correlation metrics as secondary signals. Discard metrics that do not correlate with expert judgment.

## Continuous Evaluation for Domain Drift

Domains evolve. Laws change, medical guidelines update, accounting standards revise, and programming languages release new versions. A model that was correct last year might be incorrect this year because domain ground truth shifted. You need continuous evaluation to detect domain drift.

Continuous evaluation means running your evaluation suite on a regular schedule: weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on domain pace of change. Each run generates a performance report. Compare reports over time. If performance degrades, investigate. The domain might have drifted, or your production inputs might have shifted, or the model might have degraded due to infrastructure changes.

Domain drift shows up as increasing error rates on specific test case categories. If your legal model's error rate on Delaware corporate law cases doubles over six months, Delaware corporate law might have changed. If your medical model's error rate on diabetes cases increases, diabetes treatment guidelines might have updated. If your financial model's error rate on revenue recognition cases increases, accounting standards might have changed. Drill into error patterns to diagnose drift.

When you detect domain drift, you have two options: retrain the model on updated data or add compensating logic. Retraining is preferred when drift is widespread: many domain rules changed. Compensating logic is preferred when drift is narrow: one specific rule changed. For example, if a new drug is approved, you can add it to the model's knowledge base via retrieval without retraining. If an entire therapeutic class changes, you need to retrain.

Track external domain changes proactively. Subscribe to updates from domain authorities: medical guideline committees, legal statute databases, accounting standards boards, and language release notes. When a change is announced, assess impact on your model. Add test cases covering the change to your evaluation suite. Run the suite. If the model handles the change correctly, no action needed. If it fails, schedule a retraining or add compensating logic.

Maintain a domain change log. Record every significant domain change, when you detected it, how it affected model performance, and what action you took. This log becomes institutional memory. It helps you understand why model performance changed over time and informs future retraining decisions.

## Evaluation Suite Governance

Your domain evaluation suite is a critical asset. It defines quality standards, gates deployments, and measures improvement. It must be governed with the same rigor as production code.

Version control your test sets. Store them in git alongside reference outputs, metadata, and evaluation scripts. Tag each release with a version number. Track changes over time. This ensures reproducibility: you can always re-run an old evaluation exactly as it was run originally.

Require review for test set changes. Do not let anyone add, modify, or delete test cases without review. Changes should be proposed via pull requests, reviewed by domain experts and ML engineers, and approved before merging. This prevents accidental degradation of test quality.

Document each test case. Include metadata: what scenario it represents, why it was added, what failure mode it guards against, and who created the reference output. This documentation helps future team members understand the test set and make informed decisions about updates.

Audit reference outputs periodically. Domain experts who created references might have made mistakes. As your understanding of the domain improves, you might realize that old references are incorrect. Schedule annual audits where senior experts review a sample of reference outputs and flag issues. Update incorrect references and retrain if necessary.

Separate test set curation from model development. The team building the model should not be the same team curating the test set. This prevents overfitting to the test set. If model developers know all the test cases, they will tune the model to pass those specific cases rather than generalizing. Independent test set curation maintains evaluation integrity.

Publish evaluation results internally. Share test set performance in regular reports to stakeholders: product, legal, compliance, and domain expert partners. Transparency builds trust. Stakeholders see that you are measuring quality rigorously and improving over time. This trust is essential when deploying domain-adapted models in high-stakes environments.

## When Evaluation Reveals Deployment Readiness

Your evaluation suite tells you whether the model is ready to deploy. Readiness is not binary. It depends on the deployment context: are you deploying for fully automated decisions, human-in-the-loop workflows, or advisory suggestions.

For fully automated deployment, you need near-perfect accuracy on critical cases and very high accuracy on important cases. Medical models that autonomously prescribe medications need 99 percent-plus accuracy on contraindication checks. Financial models that autonomously execute trades need 99 percent-plus accuracy on calculation and compliance checks. Legal models that autonomously draft contracts need 98 percent-plus accuracy on standard clauses. These thresholds are not arbitrary. They reflect the error rates at which automation becomes safer than human performance and the error rates that regulators and domain experts consider acceptable.

For human-in-the-loop deployment, you can tolerate lower accuracy because humans review model outputs before acting. The model assists but does not decide. Accuracy thresholds depend on human review capacity and model failure modes. If model errors are obvious and easy to catch, you can accept 85 percent to 90 percent accuracy. If model errors are subtle and hard to detect, you need 95 percent-plus accuracy even with human review. Measure not just model accuracy but human-in-the-loop accuracy: how often do human reviewers catch model errors.

For advisory deployment, where the model provides suggestions that users can ignore, you can tolerate even lower accuracy. Users treat the model as one input among many. They apply their own judgment. But advisory deployment still requires minimum quality thresholds. If the model is wrong more than 30 percent of the time, users will stop trusting it and stop using it. You need 70 percent-plus accuracy to maintain user trust, and higher accuracy to drive adoption.

Your evaluation suite should test all deployment modes. Include test cases for fully automated scenarios, human-in-the-loop scenarios, and advisory scenarios. Measure performance separately for each mode. This tells you which deployment mode is safe and which requires further improvement.

## Evaluation as a Foundation for Trust

Domain-specific evaluation is how you build trust with domain experts, regulators, and end users. Generic benchmarks do not build trust because domain stakeholders know those benchmarks do not test what matters. But a well-designed domain evaluation suite, curated by respected domain experts, evaluated transparently, and published regularly, demonstrates competence and rigor.

Invest in your evaluation suite as heavily as you invest in your model. A great model with weak evaluation is risky. A good model with strong evaluation is deployable. Evaluation is not overhead. It is the foundation of trustworthy domain adaptation.

The next step is understanding the regulatory obligations that apply to domain-specific fine-tuned models, particularly in high-risk domains where evaluation alone is not sufficient for compliance.
