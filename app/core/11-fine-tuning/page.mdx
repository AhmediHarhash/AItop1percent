# Section 11 — Fine-Tuning and Model Adaptation

Fine-tuning is the most powerful and most misused lever in the AI engineering toolkit. In 2026, with parameter-efficient methods like QLoRA running on consumer GPUs, with distillation pipelines producing specialized small models that outperform prompted frontier models on narrow tasks, and with the EU AI Act imposing downstream modifier obligations on anyone who fine-tunes a GPAI model, the decision to fine-tune is no longer just a technical choice. It is a business, legal, and operational commitment that most teams underestimate.

This section covers the complete fine-tuning lifecycle. The decision framework that filters out the projects that should never start. Training data collection, curation, and quality engineering. Synthetic data generation and distillation. The full technique landscape from supervised fine-tuning through DPO and continued pre-training. Infrastructure and platform selection. Domain adaptation for legal, medical, financial, code, and multilingual applications. Evaluation gating and safety testing that must be stricter for fine-tuned models than for base models. The cost and ROI analysis that justifies the investment. And production deployment with lifecycle management, governance, and compliance.

Nine chapters. One hundred nineteen subchapters. Everything you need to fine-tune responsibly, ship confidently, and maintain what you have built.

*The teams that fine-tune well ship models that outperform systems ten times their size. The teams that fine-tune poorly spend months producing models that are worse than the base model they started from.*
