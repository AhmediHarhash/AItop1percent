# Chapter 1 — The Fine-Tuning Decision

The decision to fine-tune is the highest-leverage gate in the entire process, because a project that should not exist cannot be saved by better data, better infrastructure, or better technique. This chapter gives you the framework to decide whether fine-tuning is the right tool, the signals that tell you prompting has hit its ceiling, the organizational readiness assessment, and the kill criteria for abandoning a project that is not working.
