# Chapter 3 — Synthetic Data Generation and Distillation

Distillation from frontier models into smaller specialized models defines fine-tuning practice in 2026. Rather than laboriously collecting, annotating, and curating thousands of examples by hand, teams now generate synthetic training data by prompting a frontier model (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, or Llama 4) and filtering the outputs through quality gates. This approach scales data production while keeping costs predictable. The frontier model becomes the teacher; your fine-tuned model becomes the student. Knowledge flows downward through the size boundary.

This chapter covers the entire synthetic data pipeline: how to design prompts that elicit diverse and high-quality outputs, the automated and human filtering gates that keep bad data out, the techniques for avoiding mode collapse and ensuring coverage of edge cases, and the verification processes that ground-truth synthetic data against expert judgment. You will also learn the legal and cost constraints that govern synthetic data generation, including API terms of service and when synthetic data generation stops paying for itself.
