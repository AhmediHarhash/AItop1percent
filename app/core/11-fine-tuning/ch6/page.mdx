# Chapter 6 — Domain Adaptation: Legal, Medical, Financial, Code, and Multilingual

Domain adaptation is not simply fine-tuning a general model on domain-specific data. Each vertical—legal, medical, financial, code, and multilingual—carries unique requirements for vocabulary, safety constraints, regulatory compliance, evaluation methodology, and expert validation. A financial model trained on earnings reports requires different success criteria than a medical model trained on clinical notes. Mistakes in legal domains carry liability; mistakes in medical domains carry patient harm. The data format, annotation schema, and quality bar shift with the domain.

This chapter covers domain-specific fine-tuning strategies across the highest-stakes verticals. You will learn what makes legal models distinct (contract interpretation, regulatory citation accuracy, adversarial reasoning), medical models (drug interactions, symptom differentiation, safety constraints), financial models (earnings analysis, risk assessment, regulatory language), code models (language-specific reasoning, repository context, test generation), and multilingual models (cross-lingual transfer, low-resource language handling, cultural nuance). The chapter also covers how to work with subject matter experts to validate outputs, build domain-specific evaluation suites that reflect what actually matters, and navigate regulatory requirements that apply to specialized models serving critical functions.

*General models know a little about everything. Domain-adapted models know everything about something. The difference is what separates a demo from a product.*
