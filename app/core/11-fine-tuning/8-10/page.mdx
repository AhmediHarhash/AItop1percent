# 8.10 — Presenting the Business Case to Non-Technical Stakeholders

In November 2025, an ML engineering lead at a logistics company presented a fine-tuning business case to the executive team for a shipment delay prediction model. She opened with a detailed explanation of the fine-tuning process: data collection methodology, model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and training infrastructure. Five minutes into the presentation, the COO interrupted: I do not need to understand how fine-tuning works. I need to understand what problem this solves, what it costs, what value it delivers, and what risks we are taking. Give me the business case, not the technical case.

The engineer pivoted to the ROI slide: $180,000 investment, $740,000 annual benefits, 311% first-year ROI. The CFO asked: where does the $740,000 come from? The engineer listed nine benefit categories, each with its own calculation and assumptions. The CFO stopped her again: I cannot evaluate nine separate benefit streams in my head. What are the two or three biggest benefits, and how confident are you in those numbers? The CTO asked: what happens if this does not work? The engineer had no answer prepared because she had not thought through the failure scenarios.

The presentation failed not because the business case was weak but because the engineer had not translated the technical and financial analysis into language and structure that executive stakeholders could quickly absorb and act on. Executives do not have time for 40-slide decks or detailed ROI spreadsheets. They need a clear, concise story: here is the problem, here is the solution, here is the cost, here is the value, here is the risk, here is what I need from you. If you cannot tell that story in ten minutes or on one page, you have not done the work of distilling complexity into clarity.

Presenting the business case to non-technical stakeholders is not about dumbing down the analysis. It is about focusing on what matters for decision-making and communicating it in the language of business outcomes, not technical metrics. Executives care about revenue impact, cost reduction, competitive advantage, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and risk. They do not care about F1 scores, validation loss curves, or GPU utilization. Your job is to connect the technical work to the business outcomes they care about and to give them confidence that you have thought through the details even if you are not presenting all of them.

## The One-Page Business Case Structure

The one-page business case is the executive summary of your detailed ROI model. It fits on a single page or slide and covers six elements: problem statement, proposed solution, investment required, value delivered, risks and mitigations, and decision requested. Each element is one to three sentences. The entire document is 200 to 300 words. This forces clarity and prioritization: you cannot include everything, so you include only what matters for the decision.

The problem statement defines the business problem, not the technical problem. Do not say: our baseline GPT-4o model achieves only 81% accuracy on support ticket classification. Say: we are misrouting 19% of customer support tickets, which adds 14 minutes to resolution time, frustrates customers, and costs $340,000 annually in wasted agent labor. The first framing is about model performance. The second is about business impact. Executives care about the second.

The problem statement includes three components: what is going wrong, what is the impact, and why does it matter. Misrouting tickets is what is going wrong. Longer resolution time, customer frustration, and wasted labor are the impacts. $340,000 annual cost is why it matters. Quantify the impact wherever possible: use dollars, percentages, time, or customer satisfaction scores. Avoid vague language like "significant challenges" or "suboptimal performance." Be specific.

The proposed solution explains what you will do to solve the problem in business terms. Do not say: we will fine-tune GPT-4o on 8,000 labeled support tickets using supervised learning. Say: we will train a specialized AI model on our support ticket data to improve classification accuracy from 81% to 90%, reducing misrouted tickets from 19% to 10%. The first framing is about the technical method. The second is about the outcome. Lead with the outcome, not the method.

Include one sentence on why this solution is the right approach. For example: fine-tuning delivers higher accuracy than our current system at lower cost than building a custom model, with deployment in three months. This preempts the obvious question: why fine-tuning instead of other options? You are signaling that you have considered alternatives and made a deliberate choice.

The investment required is the total cost of the project, broken into upfront and ongoing components. Say: this requires a $140,000 upfront investment for data preparation, model training, and deployment, plus $80,000 annually for maintenance, retraining, and operations. Do not list every cost subcategory. Executives do not need to know that annotation is $65,000 and training is $37,000. They need to know the total and whether it is one-time or recurring.

If the upfront cost is large relative to your typical project budgets, contextualize it. For example: $140,000 upfront is equivalent to the cost of one senior engineer for eight months. This helps stakeholders understand the magnitude: is this a rounding error or a significant commitment?

The value delivered is the annual benefit in dollars, summarized into two or three major categories. Say: this delivers $840,000 in annual value through three primary benefits: $510,000 from reduced resolution time as agents spend less time on misrouted tickets, $160,000 from fewer classification errors requiring manual correction, and $140,000 from lower escalation rates. First-year ROI is 282% with a payback period of 2.7 months. Lead with total value, then break it down into the biggest components, then give the ROI summary.

Do not list nine benefit categories. Executives will not remember them. Group smaller benefits into larger categories or omit them from the one-pager. If you have $840,000 in quantified benefits and $50,000 in additional smaller benefits, round to $840,000 or say "over $840,000" and move on. Precision is less important than clarity.

The risks and mitigations section addresses the two or three most significant risks and what you are doing to manage them. Say: the primary risk is that accuracy improvement is lower than projected. We mitigate this by using conservative estimates based on the lower bound of our validation set confidence interval. Even at 7 points of improvement instead of 9, ROI remains above 200%. This shows you have thought through failure modes and have a plan.

Other common risks include: adoption is slower than expected, maintenance costs are higher than budgeted, or the vendor changes pricing. For each risk, state the mitigation: phased rollout with training and support to drive adoption, contingency budget of 20% for unexpected maintenance, contract negotiation to lock in pricing for 24 months. The goal is to show that you are not blindly optimistic and that you have a plan for the most likely problems.

The decision requested is what you need from the executive team. Say: we are requesting approval for a $140,000 investment to proceed with fine-tuning and deployment over the next three months. Be specific: are you asking for budget approval, headcount approval, prioritization over other projects, or executive sponsorship? Do not leave the ask implicit. Executives should finish reading the one-pager knowing exactly what decision they are being asked to make.

## Translating Technical Metrics into Business Language

The most common mistake in presenting to non-technical stakeholders is using technical metrics without translating them into business impact. An accuracy improvement from 81% to 90% is meaningless to an executive who does not work with AI models daily. A reduction in misrouted tickets from 19% to 10%, saving $340,000 annually, is immediately meaningful.

Every technical metric has a business translation. Accuracy becomes error rate, which becomes cost of errors or customer satisfaction impact. Latency becomes user productivity or customer wait time. Precision and recall become false positives and false negatives, which become wasted effort or missed opportunities. F1 score is useless to executives; tell them what F1 score represents in terms of business outcomes.

Practice the translation for your specific use case. For a fraud detection model, do not say: we improved recall from 79% to 91%. Say: we now catch 91% of fraudulent transactions instead of 79%, preventing an additional $1.2 million in annual fraud losses. For a content moderation model, do not say: we reduced false positive rate from 4.2% to 1.8%. Say: we now incorrectly flag 1.8% of safe content instead of 4.2%, reducing user frustration and cutting appeals by 58%.

The translation is not dumbing down. It is focusing on what the metric means for the business. Executives are perfectly capable of understanding technical concepts, but they prioritize differently. They need to know whether the investment drives revenue, reduces cost, improves customer satisfaction, mitigates risk, or creates competitive advantage. Technical metrics are intermediate variables. Business outcomes are the dependent variables. Lead with the dependent variables.

## Structuring the Ten-Minute Presentation

If you are presenting the business case live rather than as a written document, structure it for a ten-minute conversation with five minutes of presentation and five minutes of Q&A. Use three to five slides: problem, solution, investment and value, risks, and ask. Spend one to two minutes per slide. Leave time for questions.

The problem slide sets up the business context. Show the current state, the impact, and the cost. Use a concrete example: here is what happens when a support ticket is misrouted. The customer contacts us about a billing issue. The ticket is classified as a technical issue and routed to the product support team. They cannot help, so they escalate to the billing team. The customer waits an extra 20 minutes, and we spend an extra 14 minutes of agent time. This happens 3,500 times per month, costing $340,000 annually. A concrete story is more memorable than abstract statistics.

The solution slide explains what you will do and what outcome you will achieve. Show the proposed accuracy improvement, the expected reduction in misrouted tickets, and the timeline. Use a visual if possible: a simple bar chart showing current accuracy versus projected accuracy, or a before-and-after comparison of error rates. Keep it simple. One chart, one message.

The investment and value slide shows the cost and the benefit side by side. A two-column layout works well: left column shows $140,000 upfront and $80,000 annual maintenance, right column shows $840,000 annual value and 282% ROI. The visual contrast between $220,000 total first-year cost and $840,000 first-year value makes the business case obvious at a glance.

The risks slide shows the top two or three risks and your mitigations. Use a simple table or bullet list. Keep it short. The goal is to demonstrate that you have thought through what could go wrong, not to scare stakeholders into rejecting the project.

The ask slide states the decision requested and the next steps. If approved today, we will begin data preparation next week, complete training by end of February, and deploy in production in March. First results will be visible in April. Be specific about timing and milestones so executives know what they are committing to and when they will see results.

## Handling Common Objections

Executives will challenge your business case. This is not adversarial. They are stress-testing your thinking and protecting the organization from bad investments. Anticipate the most common objections and prepare responses.

Objection one: the benefits seem too good to be true. How do we know this will actually work? Response: the 9-point accuracy improvement is based on validation set performance with 95% confidence, and we have used the lower bound of that confidence interval in our projections. Even if actual performance is 20% lower than projected, ROI is still over 200%. We are also piloting with 20% of traffic for the first month to validate performance in production before full rollout.

Objection two: what if adoption is slower than you expect? Response: we have built an adoption curve into our projections assuming 60% adoption in the first three months and 100% by month six. This is conservative based on our experience with similar tools. We are also investing in training and change management to drive adoption actively rather than hoping users adopt on their own.

Objection three: the ongoing maintenance cost of $80,000 per year feels high. Why do we need to keep paying that? Response: AI models degrade over time as language, customer behavior, and business processes evolve. The $80,000 covers retraining the model annually to keep it current, monitoring performance to catch issues early, and a part-time engineer to manage the lifecycle. Without this investment, accuracy will decline by 10% to 15% per year, eroding the benefits. We are not paying $80,000 for maintenance. We are paying $80,000 to sustain $840,000 in annual value.

Objection four: can we start smaller and expand if it works? Response: yes. We can pilot the fine-tuned model on 20% of tickets for the first month to validate performance and gather user feedback before full rollout. This reduces risk and allows us to adjust based on real-world data. The upfront investment remains the same because we need to train the model regardless of rollout scope, but we can stage the deployment to minimize disruption.

Objection five: what if the vendor raises prices or discontinues the model? Response: we are negotiating a 24-month pricing commitment with the vendor to lock in current rates. If the vendor discontinues the base model, we can migrate our fine-tuning to a different base model with four to six weeks of effort and $20,000 in retraining costs. We are not locked in irreversibly, though migration is not free.

Objection six: how does this compare to just hiring more support agents? Response: hiring agents to handle the current error rate would require an additional two full-time agents at $68,000 each, or $136,000 annually, just to absorb the rework from misrouted tickets. That does not fix the root cause or improve customer experience. Fine-tuning costs $220,000 in year one but eliminates the root cause, delivers $840,000 in value, and scales without adding headcount as ticket volume grows.

Prepare for these objections by role-playing with a colleague or by reviewing past business case presentations and noting what questions came up. The better prepared you are, the more confident you appear, and confidence matters when asking for six-figure investments.

## Building Executive Sponsorship

Approval is not the same as support. You can get budget approved and still struggle with adoption, prioritization, and organizational alignment if you do not have executive sponsorship. Executive sponsorship means a senior leader who actively advocates for the project, removes obstacles, and holds teams accountable for execution.

Identify the executive whose goals are most aligned with the project's outcomes. For a customer support classification project, that is likely the head of customer experience or the COO. For a fraud detection project, that is the CFO or chief risk officer. For a content moderation project, that is the head of trust and safety or the general counsel. Approach that executive early in the process, before you present the formal business case, and get their input on the problem definition, success criteria, and value framing.

When you present the business case, position the executive sponsor as a collaborator, not just an approver. Say: we have been working with the head of customer experience to understand the impact of ticket misrouting on customer satisfaction and agent productivity. This project directly supports her goal of reducing average resolution time by 15% this year. The sponsorship becomes part of the narrative, signaling to other executives that this is not just an engineering initiative but a strategic priority for a peer.

After approval, maintain regular communication with the executive sponsor. Share progress updates, flag risks early, and ask for help when you encounter obstacles. If adoption is lagging because the support team is resistant to changing workflows, the executive sponsor can intervene. If you need prioritization over competing projects, the executive sponsor can advocate. Sponsorship is not a one-time conversation. It is an ongoing relationship.

## The Follow-Up: Reporting Actual Performance Against Projections

The business case does not end with approval. It continues through deployment and into production as you track actual performance against projected performance. Finance teams and executive sponsors will ask: are we getting the ROI you promised? You need to be able to answer with data.

Build a quarterly reporting cadence that compares actual results to projections. Report on key metrics: actual accuracy achieved, actual error rate reduction, actual cost savings or quality benefits realized, actual adoption rate, and actual costs incurred. If actual performance exceeds projections, celebrate and update the business case to reflect higher value. If actual performance is below projections, explain why, what you are doing to close the gap, and what the revised ROI looks like.

For the support ticket classification example, the quarter-one report might say: we deployed the fine-tuned model to 100% of tickets in March. Actual accuracy in production is 89%, slightly below the projected 90%, due to a higher-than-expected volume of tickets related to a new product launch that was not in the training data. We are adding 500 new examples covering the new product and will retrain in May. Error rate is 11% versus the projected 10%. Actual error reduction value in Q1 is $38,000 versus projected $40,000. We are on track to deliver $152,000 in error reduction value in year one versus projected $162,000. Total year-one ROI is projected at 268% versus the original projection of 282%. The project remains highly successful.

Transparent reporting builds trust. It shows that you are managing the project rigorously, that you are not hiding underperformance, and that you are committed to delivering the value you promised. It also protects you from the perception that AI projects overpromise and underdeliver, a perception that kills future AI investments across the organization.

## The Meta-Lesson: Business Cases Are About Trust

The best business case in the world will not get approved if stakeholders do not trust you. Trust comes from competence, transparency, and accountability. Competence means you have done the technical and financial work thoroughly. Transparency means you have been honest about assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Accountability means you will own the results and report on actual performance, not just take the budget and disappear.

Build trust by being conservative in your projections, explicit about your assumptions, and prepared for objections. Build trust by showing that you have considered alternatives and chosen fine-tuning for sound reasons, not because it is trendy or because you want to play with new technology. Build trust by demonstrating that you understand the business context, not just the technical problem.

When you present a business case, you are not just presenting a financial model. You are presenting yourself as someone who can be trusted with resources, responsibility, and organizational credibility. Executives are betting on you as much as they are betting on the project. Make it easy for them to bet on you by being clear, thorough, and realistic.

The business case is the bridge between technical capability and organizational impact. It is how you turn a fine-tuning experiment into a funded project, a funded project into a production system, and a production system into measurable business value. Master the business case, and you unlock not just this project but every AI project that follows.
