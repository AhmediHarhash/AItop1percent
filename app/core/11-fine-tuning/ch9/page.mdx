# Chapter 9 — Production Deployment and Lifecycle Management

Deploying a fine-tuned model is the beginning, not the end. Training is one-time work; serving, monitoring, retraining, versioning, and compliance are ongoing operational disciplines that determine whether your model stays useful or becomes a burden. The chapters that follow cover the full lifecycle: how to serve fine-tuned models at scale with optimized inference, quantization techniques for smaller models on cheaper hardware, gradual rollout strategies that catch problems early, fast rollback when a fine-tune degrades in production, continuous monitoring for quality drift, retraining cadence and data freshness, model versioning and artifact management, multi-model serving for A/B testing and variant rollout, and the governance structures required by the EU AI Act for general-purpose AI models including your fine-tuned adapters.

Production deployment also requires attention to security and compliance that training teams often overlook. You will learn how to implement model registries and lineage tracking so you know who trained what on which data, maintain reproducibility through config management and deterministic pipelines, monitor for post-deployment data leakage and security incidents, handle multi-tenant isolation when serving different customers' LoRAs from shared infrastructure, and prepare the regulatory documentation pack that modified model deployments must provide to downstream users. A fine-tuned model is not complete until it passes security review, compliance audit, and operational readiness before reaching users.

*Training the model is the easy part. Keeping it alive, compliant, and improving in production is where the real engineering begins.*
