# 1.12 — The Fine-Tuning Change Advisory Process for Regulated Teams

Deploying a fine-tuned model without change advisory approval in a regulated industry is not a shortcut — it is a compliance violation with penalties that can reach seven figures. This is not hypothetical risk or theoretical exposure. A regional bank learned this in early 2025 when they deployed a fine-tuned model for loan application risk assessment without notifying their change advisory board, treating it as a routine software feature rather than a regulated change to a decision system. The model had been trained by the data science team, passed internal accuracy tests, and was approved by the product owner. Two months into production, a state banking regulator conducted a routine audit, discovered the model, and requested documentation: the model card, the training data lineage, the evaluation methodology, the approval chain, and the change control record. The bank could not produce most of these documents because they had never been created. The model deployment had bypassed the bank's formal change management process, which required all production system changes to be documented, reviewed, and approved by a cross-functional board. The regulator issued a finding, required the model to be taken offline pending full documentation and re-approval, and imposed a 1.2 million dollar penalty for inadequate model governance. The penalty was not for model failure or inaccuracy — the model worked as designed — but for process failure, for deploying a system that influences financial decisions without the governance controls that regulators require for all automated decision systems regardless of the underlying technology.

For teams in finance, healthcare, insurance, legal services, government, and other regulated sectors, fine-tuning is not just an engineering decision. It is a **model change** that impacts risk, compliance, and auditability. Every fine-tuned model that influences customer outcomes, financial decisions, clinical care, or legal determinations must go through a formal change advisory process. This process includes pre-deployment review by a change advisory board, comprehensive documentation of training data and evaluation methodology, approval workflows with sign-offs from risk, compliance, and legal stakeholders, audit trail creation for all decisions, and post-deployment monitoring with governance oversight. The process is slow, bureaucratic, and intentionally conservative. It is also non-negotiable. If you work in a regulated industry and deploy a fine-tuned model without change advisory approval, you are creating liability for your organization and yourself.

## Why Regulators Care About Model Changes

Regulators treat model changes as changes to automated decision systems. If a model influences lending decisions, it falls under fair lending regulations. If a model influences insurance pricing, it falls under insurance underwriting rules. If a model influences clinical care, it falls under medical device and patient safety regulations. If a model processes personal data, it falls under data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA. The fact that the model is powered by a large language model instead of traditional machine learning does not exempt it from these regulations.

When you fine-tune a model, you are creating a new decision system. The fine-tuned model behaves differently than the base model. It has learned patterns from your training data, which may include biases, errors, or proprietary information. Regulators need to verify that the model complies with applicable laws, that the training data was sourced and used appropriately, that the model outputs are accurate and auditable, and that there are controls to detect and mitigate failures.

The EU AI Act, enforced as of 2026, explicitly classifies certain AI systems as high-risk and imposes obligations on downstream modifiers. If you fine-tune a foundation model for a high-risk use case — credit scoring, employment screening, law enforcement, critical infrastructure — you are a downstream modifier. You must document your training process, conduct conformity assessments, register the system with regulators in some jurisdictions, and maintain technical documentation for audits. Ignoring these obligations is not an option.

The regulatory concern extends beyond fairness and accuracy. Regulators worry about model drift, where a fine-tuned model's performance degrades over time as production data shifts. They worry about data leakage, where the model memorizes sensitive training examples and reproduces them in outputs. They worry about adversarial inputs, where users deliberately manipulate inputs to elicit non-compliant outputs. They worry about lack of explainability, where the organization cannot explain why the model made a particular decision. The change advisory process exists to surface and address these risks before deployment.

## The Change Advisory Board for Model Updates

Most regulated organizations have an existing IT change advisory board that reviews and approves production system changes. The CAB typically includes representatives from IT operations, information security, risk management, compliance, and business stakeholders. When a team wants to deploy new code, change a database schema, or modify infrastructure, they submit a change request to the CAB. The CAB reviews the request, assesses the risk, and approves or rejects the change.

Fine-tuned models must go through the same CAB process. The model deployment is treated as a production change, and the change request must include all the documentation the CAB requires: a description of what is changing, the business justification, the risk assessment, the rollback plan, the testing results, and the approval signatures. The difference is that model changes require additional documentation specific to AI systems.

Some organizations create a **model risk management committee** that sits alongside or within the CAB and focuses specifically on AI and ML changes. The MRMC includes data scientists, model validators, legal counsel, and domain experts. The MRMC reviews model training methodologies, evaluates model fairness and bias, assesses data lineage, and verifies compliance with model risk management frameworks like SR 11-7 in the US banking sector or the equivalent frameworks in other industries.

The regional bank in the opening story did not route their fine-tuned model through the CAB because the data science team believed it was a machine learning project, not a system change. This was a misunderstanding of governance scope. If the model touches production systems or influences business decisions, it is a system change regardless of the underlying technology. The bank's updated process now requires all fine-tuning projects to be registered with the MRMC at the scoping phase, reviewed by the MRMC before training begins, and submitted to the CAB for approval before deployment.

## Documentation Requirements: Model Cards, Data Lineage, Evaluation Results

Regulators and internal governance teams require comprehensive documentation for every fine-tuned model. The core documents are the **model card**, the **data lineage report**, the **evaluation report**, and the **change control log**.

The model card is a structured document that describes the model's purpose, training process, performance characteristics, limitations, and intended use. For a fine-tuned model, the model card includes the base model name and version, the fine-tuning objective and task definition, the size and composition of the training dataset, the hyperparameters used, the performance metrics on test data, known failure modes and edge cases, the intended production use case, and the date of deployment. The model card must be written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders, including regulators who may not have ML expertise.

The data lineage report documents where the training data came from, how it was collected, who labeled it, what quality checks were applied, and whether it contains sensitive or regulated information. For example, a healthcare organization fine-tuning a model on clinical notes must document that the notes were de-identified, that patient consent was obtained if required, that the data was stored in HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, and that access to the data was logged. A financial institution fine-tuning on transaction data must document that the data complies with fair lending laws, that protected attributes were handled appropriately, and that data retention policies were followed.

The evaluation report documents how the model was tested, what metrics were measured, what the results were, and how the model compares to the baseline. The report must include performance on overall metrics like accuracy and F1 score, performance disaggregated by demographic groups or other protected classes if the task involves decisions about people, performance on adversarial test cases designed to detect vulnerabilities, and latency and cost metrics if those impact production operations. The evaluation report must also document any safety or compliance tests, such as checking that the model does not generate prohibited content or violate output constraints.

The change control log is the audit trail. It records when the fine-tuning project was initiated, who approved the project at intake, when training began and ended, what versions of the model were produced, which stakeholders reviewed the model, what the gate review decision was, when the model was deployed, and who approved the deployment. The log is timestamped and immutable. If a regulator asks "who decided to deploy this model and when," the log provides the answer.

These documents are not created at the end of the project. They are created incrementally throughout the fine-tuning lifecycle. The model card starts as a draft during intake and is updated at each phase. The data lineage report is created when the training data is finalized. The evaluation report is produced during the training phase and reviewed at the gate. The change control log is maintained continuously. By the time the model reaches deployment, the documentation is complete and ready for CAB review.

## Approval Workflows and Sign-Offs

The approval workflow for a fine-tuned model involves multiple stakeholders, each with veto power. The workflow typically proceeds in stages: initial approval from the requesting team's leadership, data approval from the data governance office, risk approval from the model risk management committee, compliance approval from legal and regulatory affairs, security approval from the information security team, and final deployment approval from the CAB.

Each approval stage requires a sign-off. The data governance office verifies that the training data complies with data usage policies and that data lineage is documented. The MRMC verifies that the model meets risk thresholds for accuracy, fairness, and robustness. Legal and regulatory affairs verify that the model complies with applicable laws and that required disclosures are in place. Information security verifies that the model does not introduce vulnerabilities and that access controls are appropriate. The CAB verifies that the deployment plan is sound, that rollback procedures exist, and that monitoring is configured.

The workflow is sequential. You cannot proceed to the next approval stage until the previous stage is complete. If any stakeholder rejects the model, the project is paused, the issue is addressed, and the approval process restarts. This sequential gating ensures that all risks are evaluated before deployment.

A healthcare technology company deploying a fine-tuned model for patient triage had to obtain nine sign-offs: the clinical lead who verified medical accuracy, the HIPAA compliance officer who verified patient data handling, the bias review team who verified fairness across demographic groups, the IT security team who verified secure deployment, the medical device regulatory specialist who verified that the system did not require FDA clearance as a medical device, the legal team who verified informed consent and liability, the risk management team who verified that failure modes were acceptable, the CAB who verified operational readiness, and the chief medical officer who provided final executive approval. The approval process took six weeks from gate review to deployment, but the model launched with full governance coverage and zero compliance findings in the subsequent audit.

## Audit Trail Requirements

Audit trails are mandatory for regulated systems. Every decision, every change, and every incident must be logged in a tamper-proof system. For fine-tuned models, the audit trail includes training event logs showing when training started, what data was used, what hyperparameters were set, and what checkpoints were produced. It includes evaluation logs showing when the model was tested, what test cases were used, and what the results were. It includes deployment logs showing when the model was deployed, what version was deployed, and who authorized the deployment.

The audit trail also includes inference logs. Every time the model generates an output, the input, output, timestamp, user ID, and session ID are logged. If a customer disputes a decision made by the model, the organization can retrieve the exact input and output from the audit trail and review the decision. If a regulator asks "how many people were affected by this model in March 2025," the audit trail provides the count.

Audit trails must be retained for the period required by regulation. In banking, model documentation and logs are often retained for seven years. In healthcare, retention periods vary by jurisdiction but can extend to ten years or longer. The audit trail must be stored in immutable storage so it cannot be altered retroactively. It must be backed up and recoverable in case of system failure.

The regional bank's compliance failure included an audit trail gap. They had deployed the model without enabling inference logging, so when the regulator asked for evidence of decision-making, the bank could not produce it. The updated process now requires all fine-tuned models to have inference logging enabled at deployment and mandates quarterly audits to verify that logs are being retained correctly.

## EU AI Act Obligations for Downstream Modifiers

The EU AI Act introduces the concept of **downstream modifiers** — organizations that take a general-purpose AI model and adapt it for a specific high-risk use case. If you fine-tune GPT-5.1 or Claude Opus 4 for credit scoring, fraud detection, hiring, or law enforcement, you are a downstream modifier. The Act imposes several obligations on you.

First, you must assess whether your use case qualifies as high-risk. The Act defines high-risk categories, including systems used for credit assessment, employment decisions, law enforcement, critical infrastructure, and access to essential services. If your fine-tuned model falls into a high-risk category, you are subject to the full compliance regime.

Second, you must conduct a **conformity assessment** before deployment. This assessment evaluates whether the model meets the Act's requirements for accuracy, robustness, transparency, and human oversight. For some high-risk systems, the conformity assessment must be conducted by a third-party notified body, not internally.

Third, you must register the system with the relevant authorities if required by your jurisdiction. Some member states require registration of high-risk AI systems in a public database. The registration includes the system's purpose, the provider's identity, and the risk mitigation measures in place.

Fourth, you must maintain **technical documentation** for at least ten years. The documentation includes the training data description, the model architecture and training process, the evaluation methodology and results, the risk management plan, and the change log. This documentation must be available for audits.

Fifth, you must implement **human oversight**. High-risk systems cannot operate fully autonomously. There must be a human in the loop who can review and override model decisions. For a fine-tuned loan approval model, this means a loan officer reviews the model's recommendation and makes the final decision. The model provides decision support, not decision automation.

Sixth, you must conduct **fundamental rights impact assessments** for systems that process personal data or affect fundamental rights. This assessment evaluates the model's impact on privacy, non-discrimination, and due process.

A fintech company deploying a fine-tuned model for credit decisioning in the EU engaged a third-party notified body to conduct the conformity assessment. The assessment took eight weeks and cost 120,000 euros. The notified body reviewed the training data for bias, tested the model on adversarial cases, verified the human oversight workflow, and audited the technical documentation. The model passed the assessment, was registered with the national authority, and deployed with full EU AI Act compliance. The cost and timeline were significant, but non-compliance was not an option — the penalties for deploying a non-compliant high-risk system can reach 6% of global annual revenue.

## Integrating Fine-Tuning Governance with IT Change Management

The fine-tuning change advisory process must integrate with your organization's existing IT change management process, not run parallel to it. This means using the same change ticketing system, following the same approval workflows, adhering to the same deployment schedules, and reporting to the same governance bodies.

When a fine-tuned model is ready for deployment, the fine-tuning team opens a change request in the IT change management system, just as they would for any other production change. The change request includes the standard fields: change description, business justification, risk rating, rollback plan, testing summary, deployment window. It also includes model-specific attachments: the model card, the data lineage report, the evaluation report, and the approval signatures from the MRMC and legal teams.

The change request is reviewed by the CAB during their regular review cycle. For low-risk changes, the review may be expedited. For high-risk changes, the review may require multiple CAB meetings and additional stakeholder input. The CAB assigns a risk rating to the change based on the model's impact, the quality of the documentation, and the robustness of the rollback plan. High-risk changes may be scheduled for deployment during low-traffic maintenance windows with extended monitoring.

If the CAB approves the change, the deployment proceeds according to the deployment plan. If the CAB defers or rejects the change, the fine-tuning team addresses the CAB's concerns and resubmits. The change is not deployed until the CAB grants approval.

Post-deployment, the fine-tuning team submits a **deployment summary** to the CAB within 48 hours. The summary confirms that the deployment completed successfully, reports any issues encountered, and provides initial monitoring metrics. If the deployment failed or if monitoring detected anomalies, the summary includes the incident details and the remediation plan.

This integration ensures that model changes are subject to the same rigor as infrastructure changes, application deployments, and schema migrations. It prevents model changes from being treated as special cases that bypass governance.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring and Governance Oversight

Deploying a fine-tuned model is not the end of the governance process — it is the beginning of ongoing oversight. Post-deployment monitoring tracks model performance, detects drift, and surfaces incidents. Governance oversight ensures that monitoring is functioning and that incidents are escalated appropriately.

The monitoring plan, approved by the CAB at deployment, specifies the metrics to track, the thresholds that trigger alerts, and the escalation path for incidents. Common metrics include inference volume, error rate, latency, accuracy on canary test cases, and drift indicators. The thresholds are defined based on the baseline performance documented in the evaluation report. If accuracy drops below the baseline by more than a specified margin, an alert is triggered.

Governance oversight requires regular reporting. The model owner submits a **model performance report** to the MRMC and the CAB on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. The report includes production metrics, incident summaries, drift analysis, and any changes to the model or its deployment. If the model has underperformed, the report explains why and what corrective actions are planned. If the model has been retrained, the report documents the retraining process and the new evaluation results.

Some organizations conduct **model audits** where an independent team reviews the deployed model's documentation, code, data, and performance. The audit verifies that the model is operating as documented, that monitoring is functioning, that data handling complies with policies, and that incidents were handled appropriately. Audit findings are reported to senior leadership and the board if the model is high-risk.

A health insurance company conducts annual audits of all fine-tuned models used in claims processing and risk assessment. The audit team reviews the model card, compares documented performance to actual production performance, tests the model on a sample of recent claims, and interviews the model owner about incidents and retraining. The audit report is submitted to the board's risk committee. Models that fail the audit are decommissioned or retrained.

## The Retraining Change Process

When a fine-tuned model requires retraining — due to drift, task changes, or new regulatory requirements — the retraining is treated as a new change and must go through the same change advisory process. The retraining change request includes the reason for retraining, the new training data description, the updated evaluation results, and the delta in performance between the old and new model versions.

Retraining changes are often lower-risk than initial deployments because the task and deployment infrastructure are already established. However, they still require review and approval because retraining can introduce new failure modes or degrade performance on edge cases. The CAB reviews the retraining change request, verifies that the new model is better than the old model, and approves deployment of the updated model.

Some organizations establish a **standing approval** for routine retraining if the retraining follows a predefined process and the performance remains within acceptable bounds. For example, a model that is retrained quarterly on the same data pipeline with the same hyperparameters may have a standing CAB approval as long as the new model's performance is within 2% of the previous model's performance and no new failure modes are detected. This reduces governance overhead for routine maintenance while preserving oversight for significant changes.

## Common Governance Failures

The most common governance failure is bypassing the CAB entirely because the team believes model changes are not subject to change management. This leads to compliance violations and regulatory findings. The second most common failure is incomplete documentation. Teams deploy models without model cards, without data lineage, or without evaluation reports, which makes audits impossible.

The third most common failure is inadequate audit trails. Teams do not enable inference logging or do not retain logs for the required period. The fourth most common failure is not involving legal and compliance early. Teams seek legal approval only after the model is trained, at which point legal may identify issues that require retraining or project termination.

The fifth most common failure is treating retraining as a technical task rather than a governance task. Teams retrain models and deploy new versions without CAB review, which creates risk if the new version underperforms or violates policies.

These failures are prevented by treating fine-tuning as a formal change process from day one, documenting everything, involving governance stakeholders at every phase, and maintaining audit trails for all activities.

## The Cost of Governance

Governance adds time and cost to fine-tuning projects. A fine-tuned model that could be deployed in six weeks without governance may take twelve weeks with full change advisory process, conformity assessments, and approval workflows. The documentation requirements add effort. The CAB reviews add wait time. The audit trails add infrastructure cost.

For regulated teams, this cost is unavoidable. The alternative — deploying without governance — is not an option. The regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruption from a compliance failure far exceed the cost of governance. The regional bank's 1.2 million dollar penalty for deploying a model without CAB approval was far more expensive than the six weeks of governance process they skipped.

The governance cost also has benefits. It forces discipline. It prevents low-quality models from reaching production. It ensures that risks are identified and mitigated before deployment. It creates institutional knowledge about what works and what does not. Teams that treat governance as a checklist to bypass are missing the point — governance is a risk management process that protects the organization and its customers.

## Building a Governance-Ready Culture

For governance to work, the engineering and data science teams must understand that governance is not optional and not negotiable. This requires cultural change. Engineers must learn that deploying a fine-tuned model without CAB approval is a violation, not a shortcut. Data scientists must learn that model cards and data lineage are deliverables, not optional documentation. Product managers must learn that governance timelines are part of the project schedule, not overhead to be compressed.

Leadership sets the tone. If the CTO or chief risk officer clearly states that all fine-tuned models require CAB approval and enforces that policy, teams will comply. If leadership treats governance as bureaucracy to be minimized, teams will bypass it. The post-incident review from the regional bank included a clear statement from the chief risk officer: "Bypassing CAB approval for model deployments is a fireable offense." That statement changed the culture.

Governance-ready culture is reinforced through training. All engineers and data scientists working on fine-tuning must complete training on the change advisory process, documentation requirements, and regulatory obligations. The training is not optional. It is a prerequisite for participating in fine-tuning projects.

The training covers the regulatory landscape, including GDPR, HIPAA, the EU AI Act, and industry-specific regulations like SR 11-7 for banking or FDA regulations for medical devices. It covers the documentation requirements for model cards, data lineage, and evaluation reports. It covers the approval workflow and the role of each stakeholder. It covers the consequences of non-compliance, including regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and potential personal liability for engineers who knowingly bypass governance.

The training also includes case studies of governance failures. The regional bank's 1.2 million dollar penalty for deploying a model without CAB approval is a teaching example. Teams see the consequences of bypassing governance and understand why the process exists. The training is updated regularly as regulations evolve and as the organization learns from its own governance experiences.

## Governance Automation and Tooling

Governance does not have to be entirely manual. Organizations invest in tooling to automate parts of the governance process, reducing overhead while maintaining rigor. Automated tooling includes intake forms that enforce required fields and reject submissions with missing information, model card generators that populate sections automatically from training metadata, data lineage trackers that log data sources and transformations, evaluation pipelines that run standardized tests and produce reports, and approval workflow systems that route change requests to the correct stakeholders and track sign-offs.

A healthcare technology company built a governance automation platform for their fine-tuning projects. When a team submits an intake request, the platform validates that the evaluation set meets minimum size requirements and that the baseline performance is documented. When a model is trained, the platform automatically generates a draft model card with the training hyperparameters, dataset size, and performance metrics pulled from experiment tracking logs. When the model is submitted for gate review, the platform routes the model card and evaluation report to the MRMC, legal, and security stakeholders and tracks their approvals. The platform reduced the time spent on governance documentation by 60% while increasing compliance with documentation standards.

Automation also extends to audit trails. Every action in the fine-tuning lifecycle — intake submission, approval, training start, evaluation completion, gate review decision, deployment — is logged automatically to an immutable audit database. The logs are timestamped, cryptographically signed, and retained for the required period. If a regulator requests the audit trail for a specific model, the platform generates a comprehensive report in minutes.

Automation does not replace human judgment. The CAB still reviews change requests, the MRMC still evaluates model risks, and legal still assesses compliance. But automation reduces the manual effort required to prepare for those reviews and ensures that no steps are skipped.

## Cross-Border Compliance Considerations

For organizations operating in multiple jurisdictions, fine-tuning governance must account for cross-border regulatory differences. A model trained and deployed in the United States may not comply with EU regulations if it is later deployed to European customers. A model trained on data from European users may not comply with GDPR if the data is transferred to non-EU infrastructure without appropriate safeguards.

Cross-border compliance requires careful scoping at the intake phase. The intake form asks: what jurisdictions will this model operate in? What data protection laws apply to the training data? What regulatory obligations apply to the model's outputs? If the model will operate in multiple jurisdictions with conflicting requirements, the team must design the model and its deployment to satisfy the strictest requirements or deploy separate models for different jurisdictions.

A global financial services firm deploying a fine-tuned model for fraud detection faced cross-border compliance challenges. The model would operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. US regulations allowed the use of certain transaction attributes that EU regulations classified as sensitive and restricted. The firm's solution was to train two models: one for US deployment that used all available attributes, and one for EU deployment that excluded the restricted attributes. Both models went through the same governance process, but the EU model had additional GDPR-specific reviews and conformity assessments. The dual-model approach added cost and complexity but ensured compliance in all jurisdictions.

Cross-border compliance also affects data residency. Some jurisdictions require that training data and model artifacts remain within their borders. A healthcare organization training a model on patient data from Germany must ensure that the data is processed on German or EU infrastructure, not transferred to US cloud regions. The governance process includes infrastructure verification to confirm that data residency requirements are met.

## The Role of External Auditors and Third Parties

For high-risk fine-tuned models, internal governance is not sufficient. Regulators may require third-party audits or conformity assessments conducted by independent notified bodies. These external reviews add another layer of assurance but also add cost and timeline.

A third-party audit involves an external firm reviewing the model's training data, methodology, evaluation results, and deployment plan. The auditor verifies that the model complies with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies. The audit report is submitted to regulators and becomes part of the compliance record.

A third-party conformity assessment for EU AI Act compliance involves a notified body evaluating the model against the Act's technical requirements. The assessment includes testing the model on adversarial cases, reviewing the risk management plan, verifying the quality management system, and auditing the technical documentation. If the model passes, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which is required for lawful deployment of high-risk systems in the EU.

These external reviews are expensive — often 100,000 to 300,000 dollars per model — and time-consuming, adding six to twelve weeks to the deployment timeline. But for high-risk use cases, they are non-negotiable. The governance process must budget for external reviews and include them in the project timeline from the start.

## Governance for Model Decommissioning

Governance does not end when a model is deployed. It also applies when a model is decommissioned. A fine-tuned model may be decommissioned because it is no longer needed, because it has been replaced by a better model, because performance has degraded, or because regulatory requirements have changed. Decommissioning requires a formal change process to ensure no disruption to users or systems.

The decommissioning change request includes the reason for decommissioning, the impact analysis showing which systems and users are affected, the migration plan for transitioning to a replacement system or reverting to manual processes, and the timeline for shutdown. The CAB reviews the decommissioning request and approves the plan.

After decommissioning, the model's documentation and audit logs are retained for the required period, even though the model is no longer active. This ensures that if a dispute or investigation arises about decisions made while the model was in production, the organization can produce the necessary records.

A health insurance company decommissioned a fine-tuned model for claims processing after discovering that it had lower accuracy on complex claims than the prompted baseline. The decommissioning change request documented the performance issues, the decision to revert to the prompted baseline, and the plan to notify affected claims processors of the change. The CAB approved the decommissioning, and the model was shut down over a two-week transition period. The model card was updated with a decommissioning notice, and the audit logs were archived for the ten-year retention period required by healthcare regulations.

## Governance as a Strategic Capability

Organizations that build strong governance for fine-tuning do not view governance as overhead — they view it as a strategic capability that enables responsible deployment of AI at scale. Governance prevents costly mistakes, reduces regulatory risk, builds trust with customers and partners, and creates a competitive advantage in regulated markets where competitors without governance capabilities cannot operate.

Governance also enables velocity. This sounds counterintuitive — how does adding process increase speed? The answer is that governance prevents rework. A model that launches with full governance coverage does not get pulled back for compliance fixes, does not trigger regulatory findings, and does not require emergency documentation after deployment. The upfront investment in governance eliminates the back-end scramble to fix governance failures.

Governance also enables scale. An organization with a mature governance process can deploy dozens of fine-tuned models across multiple teams and jurisdictions with confidence that all models meet regulatory standards. An organization without governance can only deploy a handful of models before the compliance risk becomes unmanageable.

The regional bank that paid a 1.2 million dollar penalty in 2025 rebuilt its governance process and by mid-2026 had deployed seventeen fine-tuned models with zero compliance findings, full audit trails, and complete documentation. The governance process added eight weeks to each deployment timeline but eliminated the risk of penalties and enabled the bank to deploy models at scale across credit, fraud, customer service, and risk management.

The next chapter covers training data: sourcing, labeling, quality control, and the dataset design decisions that determine whether fine-tuning succeeds or fails.
