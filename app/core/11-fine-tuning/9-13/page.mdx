# 9.13 — The Fine-Tuning Maturity Model: From Ad Hoc to Systematic

Fine-tuning maturity is not about how many models you have deployed. It is about whether you can deploy models reliably, govern them systematically, and operate them sustainably as organizational capabilities rather than individual heroics. An organization with three models deployed through rigorous process is more mature than an organization with thirty models deployed through ad hoc experimentation. The difference is reproducibility, governance, monitoring, and the ability to answer basic questions: which models are in production, what data were they trained on, who approved deployment, and how are they performing. An October 2024 logistics technology company had been fine-tuning for fourteen months across three teams: route optimization, demand forecasting, customer service automation. Each team worked independently, different tools, different evaluation frameworks, different deployment procedures. CTO asked for company-wide assessment of fine-tuning ROI and risk. No one could provide a coherent answer. No shared metrics, no common lineage system, no unified governance framework. One team had deployed six model versions in production with no evaluation records. Another team had evaluation records but no approval process. A third team had never considered data retention or reproducibility. CTO commissioned external audit. Classification: Level 1 on ML maturity scale, ad hoc and unrepeatable. Audit recommended nine-month program to establish systematic fine-tuning operations, cost one point four million dollars, required suspending new fine-tuning projects while foundational systems were built. The company lost six months of competitive advantage because they had scaled fine-tuning volume without scaling operational discipline.

The failure was operating without a maturity model. Fine-tuning maturity is not binary—you are not simply doing it right or wrong. Maturity exists on a continuum from ad hoc experimentation to systematic, optimized operations. Understanding where you are on that continuum, and what capabilities you need to advance, is essential for scaling fine-tuning safely and efficiently. Most organizations begin at Level 1, treating fine-tuning as a research activity with minimal process. The organizations that succeed in production move through defined maturity levels, systematically building the capabilities needed for reliable, compliant, and efficient fine-tuning operations.

## The Five Maturity Levels

The **Fine-Tuning Maturity Model** defines five levels, adapted from the Capability Maturity Model developed for software engineering. Level 1 is ad hoc, Level 2 is repeatable, Level 3 is defined, Level 4 is managed, and Level 5 is optimizing. Each level represents a step increase in process discipline, tooling sophistication, risk management, and operational efficiency.

Level 1 organizations conduct fine-tuning as individual experiments with no standardized process. Each researcher or engineer follows their own approach, using their own tools, and documenting results informally or not at all. There is no central registry of models, no approval process, no systematic evaluation, and no operational support for deployed models. Fine-tuning works when individuals are skilled and diligent, but there is no organizational capability that survives personnel turnover.

Level 2 organizations have established basic repeatable processes for fine-tuning within individual teams. Teams use consistent tools and frameworks, maintain some documentation, and have informal quality gates. However, practices vary across teams, there is no company-wide governance, and processes are not formally documented or enforced. Fine-tuning is repeatable within a team but not across the organization.

Level 3 organizations have defined and documented fine-tuning processes that are standardized across the organization. There is a formal model governance framework, a central model registry, documented evaluation standards, and mandatory approval gates. All fine-tuning projects follow the same process, and compliance is expected and monitored. Fine-tuning is a managed organizational capability, not an individual practice.

Level 4 organizations not only have defined processes but actively measure and manage them. They collect metrics on training efficiency, evaluation coverage, deployment success rates, and incident frequency. They use these metrics to identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and drive continuous improvement. Fine-tuning operations are instrumented, monitored, and actively managed.

Level 5 organizations continuously optimize their fine-tuning operations based on quantitative feedback. They run experiments on process changes, measure the impact, and adopt improvements systematically. They automate large portions of the fine-tuning workflow, from data preparation through deployment. They share learnings across teams and maintain a culture of continuous improvement. Fine-tuning is a strategic capability that provides sustained competitive advantage.

Most organizations in early 2026 are at Level 2 or Level 3. A small number of technology leaders—large cloud providers, AI research labs, advanced technology companies—operate at Level 4 or Level 5. The goal is not to reach Level 5 immediately. The goal is to understand your current level, identify the capabilities needed to advance, and systematically build those capabilities over time.

## Level 1: Ad Hoc

At Level 1, fine-tuning is an individual activity. Researchers and engineers experiment with fine-tuning for specific projects, but there is no organizational process or infrastructure. Training happens on individual laptops or ad hoc cloud instances. Data is prepared manually for each experiment. Hyperparameters are selected by intuition or trial and error. Evaluation is informal or omitted. Models are deployed by copying checkpoint files to production servers.

Level 1 organizations have no model registry, no lineage tracking, no reproducibility controls, and no governance framework. If you ask "which models are deployed in production," no one knows. If you ask "what data was used to train this model," the answer is a guess or a shrug. If a model fails, the response is to retrain it and hope the problem goes away.

The primary risk at Level 1 is lack of visibility and control. You do not know what models are deployed, what they were trained on, or how they will behave. You cannot respond to audits, comply with regulations, or debug incidents systematically. Fine-tuning at Level 1 is acceptable for pure research or internal experimentation with no production deployment, but it is professional negligence for production systems.

Organizations at Level 1 advance by establishing basic tooling and process. You need a central location—a shared drive, a wiki, a simple database—where training runs are logged. You need a standard template for documenting training configurations and results. You need a basic approval process—even if it is just an email to a manager—before deploying a model. These minimal steps move you toward Level 2.

## Level 2: Repeatable

At Level 2, individual teams have established repeatable processes for fine-tuning. A team uses the same training framework, the same evaluation scripts, and the same deployment procedure across multiple projects. Team members know the process and can train others on it. However, the process is informal—it exists in team knowledge and maybe a few documents, but it is not enforced or standardized across teams.

Level 2 organizations have basic tooling—a shared experiment tracking system like MLflow or Weights and Biases, a shared compute cluster or cloud environment, and some documentation of best practices. Teams maintain logs of training runs and evaluation results, but these logs are scattered across team-specific systems.

The primary advancement at Level 2 is repeatability within a team. If a team member leaves, the remaining members can continue fine-tuning projects because the process is documented and practiced. However, if you ask two different teams how they do fine-tuning, you get two different answers. There is no organizational standard.

Level 2 is sufficient for organizations with a small number of fine-tuning projects concentrated in a single team. It becomes problematic as fine-tuning scales across teams, because the lack of standardization creates silos, incompatible tooling, and duplicated effort. Two teams may solve the same problem in different ways, wasting resources and creating maintenance burden.

Organizations at Level 2 advance by documenting a company-wide fine-tuning process, establishing a central model registry, and creating governance expectations. You need a written process document that says "this is how we do fine-tuning," a registry where all models are cataloged, and a governance body that reviews and approves deployments. These steps move you toward Level 3.

## Level 3: Defined

At Level 3, fine-tuning is a defined organizational process. There is a written standard that describes how fine-tuning is conducted, from problem definition through deployment. All teams follow this standard. There is a central model registry where all fine-tuned models are cataloged. There is a governance framework with mandatory approval gates. There are documented evaluation standards that all models must meet.

Level 3 organizations have mature tooling—a model registry integrated with experiment tracking, a lineage system that captures training provenance, a deployment pipeline that enforces quality gates, and monitoring infrastructure for deployed models. Fine-tuning is not an ad hoc activity. It is a managed process with clear expectations and accountability.

The primary advancement at Level 3 is organizational consistency and control. If you ask "what models are deployed in production," you get an authoritative answer from the model registry. If you ask "what data was used to train this model," the lineage system provides documented evidence. If a regulator audits your fine-tuning practices, you can produce process documentation and compliance evidence.

Level 3 is the minimum acceptable maturity for production fine-tuning in regulated industries or high-stakes applications. If you are deploying fine-tuned models that affect customer decisions, financial outcomes, or safety-critical functions, you must operate at Level 3 or above. Operating below Level 3 in these contexts is an unacceptable risk.

Organizations at Level 3 advance by instrumenting their processes, collecting metrics, and using those metrics to drive improvement. You need to measure training efficiency, evaluation coverage, deployment success rates, incident frequency, and compliance adherence. You need to analyze these metrics regularly and act on the insights. These steps move you toward Level 4.

## Level 4: Managed

At Level 4, fine-tuning processes are not just defined but actively managed using quantitative metrics. The organization collects data on every aspect of fine-tuning—how long training takes, how often models pass evaluation, how often deployments succeed, how often incidents occur, how long incidents take to resolve. This data is analyzed to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and risks.

Level 4 organizations set targets for key metrics—evaluation pass rate above 90 percent, deployment success rate above 95 percent, incident resolution time below four hours—and actively manage toward those targets. When metrics fall short, the team investigates root causes and implements corrective actions. When metrics exceed targets, the team analyzes what went well and replicates it across projects.

The primary advancement at Level 4 is data-driven management. Decisions about process changes, tooling investments, and team structure are informed by quantitative evidence, not intuition or anecdote. If training is taking too long, the team measures where time is spent—data preparation, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation—and invests in automation or optimization for the biggest bottleneck. If incidents are frequent, the team analyzes incident patterns to identify common root causes and implements preventive measures.

Level 4 organizations also implement advanced automation. Data preparation pipelines are automated. Hyperparameter tuning uses automated methods like grid search or Bayesian optimization. Evaluation is automated and integrated into CI/CD. Deployment is automated with rollback capabilities. This automation reduces manual effort, increases consistency, and enables faster iteration.

Level 4 is the standard for organizations where fine-tuning is a core competitive capability—AI-native companies, large technology platforms, advanced enterprise AI teams. These organizations treat fine-tuning as a strategic asset and invest in the tooling and discipline needed to optimize it.

Organizations at Level 4 advance by institutionalizing continuous improvement. You need a culture of experimentation where process changes are tested, measured, and adopted based on evidence. You need mechanisms for sharing learnings across teams. You need automation that continuously evolves based on operational feedback. These steps move you toward Level 5.

## Level 5: Optimizing

At Level 5, fine-tuning operations are continuously optimized through systematic experimentation and feedback. The organization treats its fine-tuning process as a system that can be improved and runs controlled experiments to test improvements. When a new training technique is proposed, it is tested on a small set of projects, measured against existing approaches, and adopted if it demonstrates superior results.

Level 5 organizations have a culture of learning and sharing. Teams document lessons learned from each fine-tuning project and share them across the organization. The organization maintains a knowledge base of best practices, failure modes, and optimization techniques that grows over time. New team members are onboarded into this knowledge base, accelerating their effectiveness.

The primary advancement at Level 5 is continuous, systematic improvement. The organization does not just follow a defined process; it continuously refines that process based on evidence. The tooling does not just automate tasks; it learns from operational data to improve automation over time. The organization is not just good at fine-tuning; it is getting better at a measurable rate.

Level 5 is rare. As of early 2026, only a handful of organizations operate at this level for fine-tuning. These are typically organizations where AI is the core product and fine-tuning is a critical capability—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI. For most organizations, Level 4 is the realistic target.

## Assessing Your Maturity Level

To assess your organization's fine-tuning maturity, evaluate eight capability dimensions: process documentation, tooling and automation, data management, evaluation standards, governance and approval, lineage and reproducibility, incident response, and metrics and improvement.

For each dimension, ask: Is this capability ad hoc, team-specific, organizationally defined, quantitatively managed, or continuously optimized? If most dimensions are ad hoc, you are Level 1. If most are team-specific, you are Level 2. If most are organizationally defined, you are Level 3. If most are quantitatively managed, you are Level 4. If most are continuously optimized, you are Level 5.

The assessment reveals your current state and highlights gaps. If you are Level 3 overall but have ad hoc incident response, you know incident response is a priority for improvement. If you are Level 2 overall but have defined evaluation standards, you know evaluation is an area of strength to build on.

## Advancing Through Maturity Levels

Advancing through maturity levels is not about a one-time project. It is about sustained investment in capability building. Each level requires specific investments—Level 2 requires basic tooling, Level 3 requires process documentation and governance, Level 4 requires instrumentation and metrics, Level 5 requires a culture of experimentation.

You cannot skip levels. You cannot go from Level 1 to Level 4 in a single initiative. You must build the foundational capabilities at each level before advancing to the next. An organization that tries to implement Level 4 metrics without Level 3 process definitions will fail because there is no consistent process to measure.

The timeline for advancing one level is typically six to 12 months, depending on organization size and complexity. Advancing from Level 1 to Level 3 typically takes 12 to 24 months. Advancing to Level 4 takes an additional 12 to 18 months. These timelines assume dedicated investment—a team focused on building fine-tuning capabilities, executive sponsorship, and budget for tooling and training.

The return on investment is substantial. Organizations at Level 3 or above experience fewer incidents, faster time to deployment, higher model quality, and stronger compliance posture than organizations at Level 1 or 2. The ability to fine-tune models reliably and efficiently becomes a strategic advantage.

Fine-tuning maturity is not a destination. It is a journey. The organizations that succeed are the ones that assess their current state honestly, commit to systematic capability building, and invest in the people, process, and tooling needed to advance. The organizations that fail are the ones that treat fine-tuning as a purely technical activity and neglect the operational discipline required for production deployment. In 2026, fine-tuning is no longer a research experiment. It is a production capability, and it must be managed with the same rigor as any other production system.

In the next subchapter, we turn to supply chain security for model artifacts—the practices needed to secure model checkpoints, weights, and registries against tampering, unauthorized access, and supply chain attacks.
