# 7.1 — Why Fine-Tuned Models Need Stricter Evaluation Than Base Models

In mid-2025, a healthcare technology company spent seven months fine-tuning GPT-5 on 40,000 internal clinical documentation examples to reduce verbosity and improve adherence to their institutional style guide. The team ran accuracy tests on a 2,000-example holdout set, saw task performance improve from 81% to 93%, and deployed the model to production serving 1,200 clinicians across three hospital systems. Within eleven days, the compliance team flagged the model for generating responses that omitted critical safety disclaimers present in the base model outputs, refused to answer legitimate clinical questions it had previously handled correctly, and introduced demographic assumptions not present in the training data or the base model behavior. The root cause was not a training data problem. The fine-tuning process had degraded capabilities the team never tested for, introduced biases they never measured, and removed safety behaviors they assumed were immutable. They had evaluated the model more casually after fine-tuning than before, operating under the assumption that a model trained on their own data would be safer and more reliable than the base model. They were wrong. The incident cost $1.8 million in rollback effort, compliance review, and re-training, and delayed their deployment by five months.

This failure reflects the single most dangerous misconception in fine-tuning: that training a model on your own data makes it safer, more predictable, and less in need of rigorous evaluation. The opposite is true. Fine-tuning introduces risk in ways base model usage does not, and every fine-tuned model requires stricter, broader, and more adversarial evaluation than the base model it derives from. This is not optional caution. It is a structural requirement driven by the mechanics of how fine-tuning alters model behavior.

## The False Confidence Trap

When you use a base model from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, you inherit the benefit of evaluation work performed by teams of dozens of researchers over thousands of hours. These models have been tested for alignment, safety, bias, refusal behavior, instruction following, factual accuracy, and robustness across millions of prompts and adversarial scenarios. When you fine-tune that model, you discard an unknown portion of that work. You do not know which behaviors will degrade, which safety guardrails will weaken, or which capabilities will vanish until you test for them explicitly. The base model's safety properties are not a floor. They are a starting point you are actively modifying.

Teams fall into the false confidence trap because fine-tuning feels like refinement. You are training the model on real examples from your domain, written by your experts, reviewed for quality and correctness. The intuition is that this process makes the model more aligned with your needs and therefore more reliable. That intuition is correct for the narrow capabilities you are training for. It is catastrophically wrong for everything else. Fine-tuning is not additive. It is transformative. Every parameter update changes the model's behavior in ways that extend far beyond the examples in your training set. You are not teaching the model new tricks while preserving old ones. You are reshaping the entire probability distribution that governs its outputs.

The result is that fine-tuned models exhibit failure modes base models do not. They forget how to perform tasks they previously handled well. They develop new biases not present in the training data. They refuse requests they should handle or comply with requests they should refuse. They generate outputs that are technically correct for your task but violate safety norms, ethical guidelines, or regulatory requirements in adjacent contexts. These are not edge cases. They are predictable consequences of the fine-tuning process, and they require evaluation strategies specifically designed to detect them.

## Catastrophic Forgetting and Capability Degradation

The first category of risk is **catastrophic forgetting**, the phenomenon where fine-tuning a model on a narrow task causes it to lose performance on tasks not represented in the fine-tuning data. This is not a bug. It is how gradient descent works. When you optimize a model to perform well on your training distribution, you shift probability mass away from behaviors not rewarded by that distribution. If your training data consists entirely of clinical summaries, the model gets worse at writing marketing copy, generating code, translating languages, and performing arithmetic unless those capabilities happen to be exercised incidentally by your training examples.

Catastrophic forgetting is particularly insidious because it is silent. The model does not warn you that it has lost the ability to perform tasks you never tested. It continues to respond confidently to prompts in degraded domains, producing outputs that are plausible but incorrect. In the healthcare company's case, the fine-tuned model lost the ability to correctly handle edge-case clinical scenarios not well-represented in the training set, including rare diagnoses, non-standard patient populations, and low-frequency medication interactions. The base model handled these cases correctly because it had seen diverse medical literature during pre-training. The fine-tuned model had seen 40,000 examples of routine documentation from three hospitals and optimized for that distribution at the expense of everything else.

You cannot prevent catastrophic forgetting entirely, but you can measure it. This requires maintaining a **regression test suite** that evaluates the model on capabilities you care about preserving, even if those capabilities are not the primary focus of your fine-tuning effort. If you are fine-tuning for clinical documentation, your regression suite must include clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, medication safety, and patient communication scenarios. If you are fine-tuning for customer support, your regression suite must include escalation handling, refund policy adherence, and cross-sell appropriateness. These are not optional tests. They are the minimum necessary to detect whether your fine-tuning process has broken things you depend on.

## Safety Degradation and Alignment Drift

The second category of risk is **safety degradation**, the phenomenon where fine-tuning weakens the model's refusal behavior, bias mitigation, or adherence to ethical guidelines established during base model training. Base models from major providers are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback, constitutional AI, or other alignment techniques designed to make the model refuse harmful requests, avoid generating biased content, and respect user safety. Fine-tuning can undo this work. If your training data contains examples that implicitly reward behavior the base model was trained to avoid, the fine-tuned model will learn to produce that behavior.

This happens even when your training data is clean. Consider a customer support fine-tuning dataset consisting of 10,000 real support conversations labeled with resolution outcomes. The base model has been trained to refuse requests for personally identifiable information, decline to generate financial advice, and avoid making medical recommendations. Your training data contains no examples of these refusals because your support team correctly escalates those requests to specialized teams, and those escalations are not logged in the training set. The fine-tuned model learns from the absence of refusals. It sees thousands of examples where customer requests are fulfilled directly and zero examples where requests are appropriately declined. The result is a model that is more compliant than the base model, more willing to attempt tasks it should refuse, and less likely to recognize when a request is outside its scope of safe operation.

Safety degradation is not hypothetical. In the healthcare case, the fine-tuned model began omitting standard liability disclaimers present in base model outputs because those disclaimers were inconsistently included in the training data. The model learned that shorter, more direct responses were rewarded by the fine-tuning objective and optimized for brevity at the expense of safety. The base model had been trained to include disclaimers as a default behavior. The fine-tuned model had been trained on examples where disclaimers were often omitted, and it learned to omit them systematically.

You detect safety degradation by running adversarial evaluations designed to test refusal behavior, bias, and alignment. These evaluations must be more comprehensive for fine-tuned models than for base models because you are testing not only whether the model refuses harmful requests but also whether fine-tuning has introduced new categories of harm. Your adversarial suite must include requests the base model refuses, edge cases where refusal is contextually appropriate, and scenarios where the fine-tuned model might have learned to comply inappropriately based on patterns in your training data.

## Bias Introduction and Amplification

The third category of risk is **bias introduction**, the phenomenon where fine-tuning introduces or amplifies demographic, cultural, or contextual biases not present in the base model. This occurs when your training data reflects biases in your organization's historical practices, your user population, or your domain-specific conventions. The model learns these biases as patterns and generalizes them to new contexts.

A financial services company fine-tuned GPT-4 on three years of loan application review notes written by their underwriting team. The training data was factually accurate and procedurally correct. It also reflected the demographic composition of their historical applicant pool, which skewed heavily toward higher-income urban applicants in their primary geographic markets. The fine-tuned model learned to associate creditworthiness signals with demographic markers correlated with that population. When deployed to a new market with different demographic patterns, the model systematically underestimated creditworthiness for applicants whose profiles differed from the training distribution, even when those applicants met all objective criteria for approval. The base model did not exhibit this bias because its training data was broader and more demographically diverse. The fine-tuned model learned the bias from the company's own data.

Bias introduction is particularly difficult to detect because it requires testing the model on populations and scenarios not well-represented in your training data. If you evaluate the model only on holdout examples drawn from the same distribution as your training set, you will not see the bias. You must construct adversarial test cases that probe for differential performance across demographic groups, geographic regions, language variants, and contextual factors that correlate with protected characteristics. This is not a one-time test. It is an ongoing evaluation requirement that must be repeated as your training data evolves and your deployment context changes.

## Unpredictable Emergent Behaviors

The fourth category of risk is **emergent behavior**, the phenomenon where fine-tuning causes the model to develop new failure modes that were not present in the base model and were not predictable from the training data. These behaviors emerge from complex interactions between the base model's pre-training, the fine-tuning data distribution, and the optimization dynamics of the fine-tuning process. They are not bugs in the traditional sense. They are properties of the learned model that you did not intend and cannot easily explain.

A legal technology company fine-tuned Claude Opus 4.5 on contract review examples to improve precision in identifying non-standard clauses. The fine-tuned model became significantly more cautious in its classifications, flagging standard clauses as non-standard when they appeared in unusual positions within the contract structure, even when the clause language was identical to known-standard templates. The base model did not exhibit this behavior. The fine-tuned model had learned a spurious correlation between clause position and non-standard status from the training data, where non-standard clauses were disproportionately located in atypical sections. The emergent behavior was not a failure of the training process. It was a consequence of the model learning a pattern that was predictive in the training distribution but not valid in the general case.

You cannot predict emergent behaviors in advance, but you can detect them through comprehensive testing that goes beyond simple accuracy metrics. You must evaluate the model on diverse test cases that probe for sensitivity to input variations, consistency across paraphrased prompts, robustness to distributional shift, and stability under adversarial perturbations. These tests are not standard practice for base model evaluation, but they are essential for fine-tuned models because fine-tuning increases the likelihood of emergent behaviors by narrowing the model's training distribution.

## The Evaluation Strictness Principle

The fundamental principle is this: fine-tuned models require stricter evaluation than base models because fine-tuning introduces risk that base model usage does not. You are modifying a system that has been extensively tested by the provider, and you are doing so with orders of magnitude less evaluation resources, on a narrower distribution, with less visibility into the consequences. This asymmetry demands a more rigorous, more adversarial, and more comprehensive evaluation process than you would apply to the base model.

Stricter evaluation means testing for more failure modes, using more diverse test cases, applying more stringent acceptance criteria, and running evaluations more frequently. It means maintaining separate test suites for regression, safety, bias, and emergent behavior, and treating all four as mandatory gates for deployment. It means evaluating the fine-tuned model not only on your primary task but also on adjacent tasks, edge cases, and adversarial scenarios designed to reveal degradation. It means comparing fine-tuned model performance to base model performance on every metric you care about and requiring that the fine-tuned model match or exceed the base model on all of them, not just the narrow task you fine-tuned for.

This is more work than most teams budget for. It is also non-negotiable. The cost of insufficient evaluation is not a minor performance regression. It is a production incident, a compliance violation, a safety failure, or a bias scandal that destroys user trust and regulatory standing. The healthcare company learned this the hard way. You do not have to.

The next step is establishing a rigorous baseline before you begin fine-tuning, ensuring you have a clear reference point for what the base model can do and what your fine-tuned model must preserve. That baseline is the foundation of every evaluation decision that follows.
