# Chapter 5.3 — Balancing & Difficulty (Easy / Normal / Hard / Adversarial)

**What we're doing here:**
If your eval dataset is too easy, your metrics lie.
If it's too hard, your team ignores the results.
If difficulty is unbalanced across slices, you'll ship confidently in one area and silently fail in another.

Difficulty balancing is how you make your evaluation dataset **honest** — reflecting the real spread of easy, moderate, hard, and adversarial cases your system will face in production.

## 1) Why difficulty mix matters

Most teams start with whatever examples they have. The result: 70–80% of cases are "normal" or easy, and the hard/adversarial tail is barely represented.

What happens next:
- **Metrics look great** — because most cases are easy
- **Leadership approves a release** — based on those metrics
- **Production fails** — on the hard, ambiguous, multi-constraint, adversarial cases that real users actually send

This is the "easy dataset trap," and it's one of the most common eval failures in enterprise AI.

**The 2026 reality:**
Models have become very good at easy cases. By mid-2026, most frontier models saturate traditional benchmarks. The signal now lives almost entirely in the hard and adversarial tail. If your dataset doesn't include that tail, your eval is worthless for differentiating model versions or catching regressions.

## 2) The four difficulty levels

### Easy
Single-step, clear intent, unambiguous, well-covered by training data and docs.
- **Chat:** "What are your business hours?" — single fact, no ambiguity
- **RAG:** Query with one obvious matching doc, answer is a direct quote
- **Agent:** Single tool call, no branching, no confirmation needed
- **Voice:** Clear speech, quiet environment, simple command

### Normal
Typical production complexity. May require moderate reasoning, context use, or multi-step logic, but not edge-case territory.
- **Chat:** "I want to change my plan but keep my current billing date" — requires understanding plan rules
- **RAG:** Query requires synthesizing 2–3 chunks, answer needs slight rephrasing
- **Agent:** 2–3 tool calls in sequence, standard parameters, expected success
- **Voice:** Some background noise, natural speech with filler words

### Hard
Requires complex reasoning, handles ambiguity, involves multiple constraints, or tests rare-but-real scenarios.
- **Chat:** Multi-constraint request with conflicting rules
- **RAG:** Query semantically close to a wrong doc (retrieval trap), correct answer requires careful grounding
- **Agent:** Multi-tool workflow with a partial failure mid-sequence, requires fallback logic
- **Voice:** Heavy accent, barge-in mid-sentence, noisy environment, multi-turn with corrections

### Adversarial
Intentionally designed to break or manipulate the system. Tests safety boundaries, prompt injection resistance, policy edge cases, and failure resilience.
- **Chat:** Prompt injection attempt, social engineering to bypass refusal
- **RAG:** Queries designed to make the model cite non-existent sources or hallucinate authority
- **Agent:** Requests for prohibited tool sequences, attempts to bypass confirmation requirements
- **Voice:** Spoofed identity attempts, abusive language, rapid topic-switching to confuse dialog state

## 3) Default mix ratios

These are practical defaults. Adjust based on your product's risk profile.

**General assistant (Tier 0–1 heavy):**
15–20% easy, 55–65% normal, 15–20% hard, 5–10% adversarial

**High-stakes product (Tier 2–3 heavy):**
10% easy, 45–50% normal, 25–30% hard, 15–20% adversarial

**Safety/red-team suite (dedicated):**
0% easy, 10% normal, 30% hard, 60% adversarial

Why adversarial gets its own heavy allocation in safety suites: safety failures almost never happen on easy cases. If you're testing safety, you need adversarial-dominant datasets — otherwise you're testing the absence of attacks, not resistance to them.

## 4) How to assign difficulty labels

Difficulty labeling is not "just guess." Use a structured approach.

### Heuristic signals (automated first pass)
Score each case on query complexity (number of constraints, multi-hop reasoning, ambiguity), context requirements (how many docs/chunks needed), action complexity (number of tools, branching, error handling), and environmental factors (noise, accent, interruptions).

Simple heuristic: count the hard factors present. Zero factors means easy. One to two means normal. Three to four means hard. Intentionally adversarial design gets the adversarial label.

### Human review pass (required for gold sets)
After automated labeling, sample 20% of each difficulty bucket. Have a domain expert confirm or override. Pay special attention to the easy/normal boundary (the most commonly mislabeled) and hard vs adversarial (adversarial must be intentional, not just hard).

### Production signals (feedback loop)
Use production data to validate difficulty labels. High retry rate suggests the case is likely hard or mislabeled as normal. High escalation rate suggests hard. High thumbs-down rate could be hard or a model failure on normal. Flagged/reported cases are potentially adversarial.

This feedback loop lets you re-calibrate difficulty labels over time based on real-world performance.

## 5) Balancing across slices

Difficulty must be balanced **within each slice**, not just overall.

If your English cases are 60% easy but your Spanish cases are 80% hard, your per-language comparison is broken — any quality difference might just reflect difficulty imbalance.

For each slice dimension (language, tier, tenant, channel), check: does the difficulty distribution roughly match the target mix? Are any slices missing adversarial cases entirely? Are any slices dominated by easy cases?

You don't need perfect balance. You need: every tier has representation at every difficulty level, no slice has more than double the target ratio for any difficulty level, and adversarial cases exist for every Tier 2–3 slice. If a slice is under-represented, use synthetic generation to fill the gap (5.1 source rules apply).

## 6) Knobs & defaults

**Difficulty label field** — add to every eval example:
```
difficulty: easy | normal | hard | adversarial
difficulty_source: heuristic | human | production_signal
difficulty_version: v1.0
```

**Rebalance cadence:** Monthly check of difficulty distribution per slice. Per model upgrade, re-run difficulty heuristics (what was "hard" for v1 may be "easy" for v2). Per dataset expansion, ensure new cases don't skew the mix.

**Over/under-sampling rules:** Never drop hard/adversarial cases to "fix" low scores — that's gaming, not balancing. Over-sample hard cases in Tier 2–3 suites. Under-sample easy cases if the dataset is too large (cut easy first, never hard).

---

## 7) Failure modes

**"Our metrics look great but production quality is bad."**
Dataset is 70%+ easy cases. Hard/adversarial tail under-represented. No difficulty-stratified reporting. Fix: audit difficulty distribution, add hard and adversarial packs, report metrics sliced by difficulty.

**"Our eval scores are so low the team stopped trusting them."**
Dataset is too adversarial-heavy. Hard cases dominate normal production distribution. Fix: rebalance toward production-realistic mix. Separate safety/adversarial suite from quality tracking suite. Report difficulty-level scores separately.

**"Scores improved but nothing changed."**
Difficulty drift — model got better, so "hard" cases became effectively "normal." Dataset difficulty was never recalibrated. Fix: re-assess difficulty labels after every major model change. Track model pass rate by difficulty over time — if "hard" pass rate hits 90%, those aren't hard anymore.

**"Adversarial cases leak into the normal test set."**
No clear labeling distinction between "hard real scenario" and "intentionally adversarial." Cases created for red-teaming were added to the general eval set. Fix: enforce adversarial tag at creation time. Separate adversarial suite from general quality suite.

## 8) Enterprise expectations

- They label every eval case with difficulty and track difficulty distribution as a dataset health metric
- They maintain separate suites: general quality (balanced mix), safety/adversarial (adversarial-heavy), regression (stable mix)
- They re-calibrate difficulty after every major model or prompt change
- They report metrics sliced by difficulty level — leadership sees "hard-case quality" as a distinct metric
- They treat difficulty balance as a release gate: if adversarial coverage drops below threshold, dataset is not ready
