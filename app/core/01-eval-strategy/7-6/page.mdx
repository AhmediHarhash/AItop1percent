# 7.6 Confidence, Abstention & Escalation to Humans

A radiologist reviews a chest X-ray. The scan shows a small nodule in the upper left lobe. It could be benign calcification. It could be early-stage cancer. The radiologist has seen thousands of similar cases, but this one sits right on the edge of their experience. They flag it: "Recommend biopsy and specialist consultation." They don't guess. They escalate.

Your automated eval system needs the same discipline. Not every case can be judged with high confidence. Some outputs are ambiguous. Some tasks are novel. Some failures are subtle enough that even a well-calibrated LLM judge hesitates. In 2026, the best eval systems know when to say "I don't know" and route the hard cases to humans who can make the final call.

This chapter covers **confidence estimation**, **abstention policies**, and **escalation routing**—the mechanisms that let automated eval know its limits and ask for help when it needs it.

## Why Automated Eval Needs Confidence

You deploy an LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to score 10,000 customer support responses per day. The judge gives each response a score: Pass or Fail. You trust the results. You update your production model based on these scores. Then, three weeks later, a human reviewer samples the judge's decisions and finds that 15% of the "Pass" cases were actually failures—the judge misunderstood nuance, missed context, or hallucinated a justification.

The problem wasn't that the judge was bad. The problem was that you treated every judgment as equally reliable. Some cases were easy: clear policy violations, obvious hallucinations, perfect responses. The judge scored those with high confidence. Other cases were hard: borderline tone issues, ambiguous customer intent, edge-case policy interpretations. The judge guessed on those—and guessed wrong 30% of the time.

**Confidence** is the judge's internal estimate of how reliable its own score is. A confident judgment says "I'm sure this is a Pass." A low-confidence judgment says "I think this might be a Pass, but I'm not certain." Without confidence estimates, you can't tell the difference. You treat every score as gospel, and you inherit all the judge's mistakes on the hard cases.

In 2026, production eval systems route high-confidence cases through automation and escalate low-confidence cases to humans. This **hybrid eval pattern** (see Chapter 6.8) lets you scale judgment while maintaining quality on the cases that matter most.

---

## Confidence Estimation Methods

How does an LLM judge express confidence? Several techniques have emerged:

**1. Explicit confidence scores**

Prompt the judge to output a confidence rating alongside its score:

```yaml
judge_prompt: |
  Score this response as Pass or Fail.
  Then rate your confidence: Low, Medium, or High.

  Output format:
  Score: [Pass/Fail]
  Confidence: [Low/Medium/High]
  Reasoning: [brief explanation]
```

The judge outputs "Confidence: Low" when the case is ambiguous. You parse this field and route low-confidence cases to human review. Simple, interpretable, and effective for many use cases.

**2. Chain-of-thought certainty markers**

Ask the judge to reason out loud and look for hedging language:

- "I'm fairly certain this is a Pass" → medium confidence
- "This is clearly a Fail" → high confidence
- "It's hard to say" or "This could go either way" → low confidence

You parse the reasoning for keywords like "unclear," "ambiguous," "possibly," "might be." If the reasoning contains multiple hedge words, flag for escalation. This method works well with verbose reasoning traces but requires careful prompt engineering to avoid false positives.

**3. Consistency across multiple samples**

Run the judge three times with temperature greater than 0. If all three runs produce the same score, confidence is high. If the scores disagree (Pass, Fail, Pass), confidence is low—the judge is uncertain and sampling from a broad distribution.

This **multi-sample consistency check** is robust to prompt variance but triples your inference cost. In 2026, teams use it selectively: for high-stakes evals, edge-case detection, or calibration audits.

**4. Logit-based confidence**

For models that expose token-level probabilities, extract the logits for the final score token. If the model assigns 0.95 probability to "Pass," confidence is high. If it assigns 0.52 to "Pass" and 0.48 to "Fail," confidence is low—the model is nearly indifferent.

Logit-based confidence is theoretically clean but requires API access to token probabilities (not always available) and careful calibration (see below). Some teams find it more reliable than prompt-based confidence; others find it poorly calibrated out of the box.

**5. Ensemble disagreement**

Run two or three different judge models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro). If they agree, confidence is high. If they disagree, confidence is low—different models see the case differently, signaling ambiguity.

This **multi-judge ensemble** (covered in depth in Chapter 7.7) is expensive but powerful. In 2026, it's standard for safety-critical evals, high-value decisions, and calibration baselines.

---

## The Confidence Threshold Decision

Once you have confidence estimates, you need a **threshold**: the cutoff that decides whether to trust the judge or escalate to a human.

Set the threshold too high, and you escalate 80% of cases—automation provides little value. Set it too low, and you auto-approve low-confidence failures—quality collapses.

The right threshold depends on three factors:

**1. Task risk**

High-risk tasks (customer-facing content, compliance decisions, safety classifications) demand high confidence. You set the threshold at 0.85 or "High" and escalate liberally. Better to over-escalate than to auto-approve a critical failure.

Low-risk tasks (internal summarization, draft generation, brainstorming feedback) tolerate lower confidence. You set the threshold at 0.6 or "Medium" and let the judge handle ambiguous cases. Human review is expensive; you reserve it for clear errors.

**2. Human review capacity**

If you have 50 human reviewers and 10,000 cases per day, you can afford to escalate 5% of cases (500 per day, 10 per reviewer). Your threshold should produce roughly 5% escalation rate.

If you have 5 reviewers, you can only afford 1% escalation (100 cases per day, 20 per reviewer). You raise the threshold to reduce escalation volume, accepting that some low-confidence cases will slip through.

**3. Cost-quality tradeoffs**

Escalation costs money: human time, delayed feedback, operational overhead. Automation mistakes cost reputation, user trust, or regulatory risk. The optimal threshold balances these costs.

Some teams run **A/B threshold experiments**: route 50% of traffic through threshold=0.7, 50% through threshold=0.8, and measure downstream impact (error rates, escalation volume, human reviewer satisfaction). The threshold that minimizes total cost—automation errors plus human review time—wins.

In 2026, mature teams treat the confidence threshold as a **tunable hyperparameter** and adjust it quarterly based on model updates, task drift, and business priorities.

---

## Abstention: When to Refuse to Score

Confidence thresholds handle uncertainty by escalating low-confidence cases. But there's a more aggressive approach: **abstention**—teaching the judge to refuse to score when it's unsure.

Instead of outputting "Score: Pass, Confidence: Low," the judge outputs "Score: ABSTAIN, Reason: Insufficient context to evaluate tone." The case goes straight to human review without a tentative automated score.

Abstention is cleaner than low-confidence scoring. It avoids the failure mode where a "Pass (Low)" score gets treated as a Pass by downstream systems that ignore the confidence field. It forces explicit routing: either the judge is confident enough to score, or it abstains and escalates.

When should a judge abstain?

**1. Missing context**

The output references a conversation history that's not provided. The judge can't evaluate coherence without context, so it abstains.

**2. Ambiguous criteria**

The rubric says "tone should be professional" but doesn't define "professional" for this edge case. The judge recognizes the ambiguity and abstains.

**3. Novel task types**

The judge was trained on customer support evaluations but now sees a legal contract. It's out of distribution. It abstains rather than guessing.

**4. Multi-dimensional uncertainty**

The output is factually accurate but ethically questionable. The judge is confident on accuracy (Pass) but uncertain on ethics (Fail?). Rather than picking one dimension, it abstains and lets a human weigh the tradeoffs.

**5. Calibration failure**

The judge's reasoning contains contradictions: "This response is polite and professional, so I'll score it as Fail." The inconsistency signals a reasoning error. The judge abstains to avoid propagating the mistake.

Abstention policies are stricter than low-confidence routing. They reduce automation coverage (you escalate more cases) but increase precision (you auto-score only when truly confident). In 2026, teams use abstention for safety-critical evals and confidence-based routing for high-volume production evals.

---

## Escalation Routing: Sending Cases to the Right Humans

Once you've flagged a case for escalation, where does it go? Not all human reviewers are equally qualified to handle all edge cases.

**Routing by task type**

Technical accuracy cases go to domain experts (engineers, researchers). Tone and safety cases go to content moderators or policy specialists. Legal or compliance cases go to legal reviewers. Multi-dimensional cases (e.g., "Is this medically accurate and ethically appropriate?") go to hybrid teams with multiple specializations.

**Routing by risk tier**

Low-risk escalations (internal feedback, draft suggestions) go to junior reviewers or crowdworkers. High-risk escalations (customer-facing content, regulatory decisions) go to senior reviewers with veto authority. Critical escalations (safety incidents, legal exposure) go to incident response teams with 24-hour SLAs.

**Routing by confidence level**

Cases flagged as "Low Confidence" might go to a single human reviewer for a quick check. Cases flagged as "ABSTAIN - Novel Task" might go to a panel of three reviewers for consensus judgment. Cases flagged as "Multi-Judge Disagreement" (see below) might go to a senior arbitrator who reviews all three judge rationales and makes the tiebreaker decision.

**Routing by active learning value**

Some escalations are more informative than others. A case that sits exactly on the decision boundary—where the judge outputs 0.50 probability Pass—teaches you more about the judge's calibration than a case where the judge outputs 0.51 Pass (barely low-confidence). In 2026, teams use **active learning** heuristics to prioritize the most informative escalations for human review, maximizing the signal from limited human capacity (see Chapter 7.3 on calibration).

**Routing metadata**

Escalation tickets include:
- The original input/output pair
- The judge's tentative score (if any)
- The judge's reasoning trace
- The confidence estimate or abstention reason
- The task rubric and any relevant context
- A recommended reviewer type (technical, safety, legal)

This metadata helps the human reviewer understand why the case was escalated and what decision the judge struggled with. It turns escalation into a **collaborative judgment** rather than a blind handoff.

---

## The Cost-Quality Curve

Confidence thresholds create a tradeoff:

- **Higher threshold** → more escalations → higher cost, higher quality, lower automation coverage
- **Lower threshold** → fewer escalations → lower cost, lower quality, higher automation coverage

This is the **cost-quality curve**. Every team finds a different sweet spot based on their risk tolerance, budget, and quality bar.

Example: An e-commerce company evaluating product descriptions.

- Threshold = 0.9: Escalates 20% of cases. Automation precision = 98%. Human review cost = $2000/day. Quality incidents = 0.1/day.
- Threshold = 0.7: Escalates 5% of cases. Automation precision = 92%. Human review cost = $500/day. Quality incidents = 2/day.
- Threshold = 0.5: Escalates 1% of cases. Automation precision = 85%. Human review cost = $100/day. Quality incidents = 5/day.

If each quality incident costs $500 in customer trust and support overhead, the optimal threshold is 0.7: you spend $500 on review and $1000 on incidents (2 × $500) = $1500 total, cheaper than the $2100 at threshold 0.9 ($2000 + 0.1 × $500) or the $2600 at threshold 0.5 ($100 + 5 × $500).

The math depends on your specific cost structure, but the principle holds: **optimal confidence thresholds minimize the sum of automation errors and escalation costs**.

In 2026, teams model this curve explicitly. They run threshold sweeps (test 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), measure escalation rates and error rates at each threshold, assign dollar costs to errors and reviews, and pick the threshold that minimizes total cost. They update this analysis quarterly as models improve (shifting the curve) and business priorities change (shifting the cost weights).

## Multi-Judge Confidence: Wisdom of Crowds for AI

A single judge's confidence estimate is noisy. It might say "High Confidence: Pass" on a case it misunderstands. It might say "Low Confidence: Fail" on a case it understands perfectly but second-guesses itself.

**Multi-judge ensembles** provide a more robust confidence signal. If three judges all agree on Pass, you trust the decision. If two say Pass and one says Fail, you escalate—disagreement signals ambiguity.

**Agreement as confidence**

- 3/3 agreement → high confidence, auto-approve
- 2/3 agreement → medium confidence, escalate or auto-approve depending on risk
- 1/2/0 split (one Pass, one Fail, one Abstain) → low confidence, always escalate

**Weighted voting**

Not all judges are equal. If Judge A has 95% precision and Judge B has 85% precision (measured on your calibration set), you weight Judge A's vote more heavily. A 2-1 vote where the two agree votes come from high-precision judges is more confident than a 2-1 vote where the two agree votes come from low-precision judges.

**Reasoning similarity**

Three judges might all output "Pass," but if they give wildly different reasons ("It's factually accurate" vs. "It's polite" vs. "It's concise"), confidence is lower than if they all say "It's factually accurate." You parse the reasoning traces and compute similarity (e.g., embedding cosine similarity). High reasoning similarity → high confidence.

Multi-judge confidence is expensive—3× the inference cost—but it's worth it for high-stakes evals. In 2026, teams use it selectively:
- Run 3 judges on every escalation candidate (low-confidence single-judge cases)
- Run 3 judges on a random 10% sample for calibration checks
- Run 3 judges on all cases for safety-critical evals (abuse detection, compliance)

The wisdom of crowds applies to AI as much as to humans. Disagreement is information. Agreement is confidence.

---

## Edge Case Detection

Some cases are inherently hard to judge. They're ambiguous, novel, or multi-dimensional. **Edge case detection** is the art of identifying these cases automatically so you can route them to appropriate review.

**Ambiguity signals**

- The input contains contradictory instructions ("Be concise but comprehensive")
- The rubric allows multiple interpretations ("professional tone" in a casual industry)
- The output sits exactly on a decision boundary (score = 0.500)

**Novelty signals**

- The input is out-of-distribution (embedding distance from training examples above threshold)
- The output uses vocabulary or structure never seen in calibration data
- The task type is new (first time seeing a legal contract in a support eval system)

**Multi-dimensional conflict**

- High accuracy, low safety (factually correct but offensive)
- High relevance, low groundedness (answers the question but hallucinates evidence)
- High utility, low compliance (solves the problem but violates policy)

When multiple criteria conflict, the case is an edge case. The judge might score each dimension independently and flag cases where dimensions disagree.

**Uncertainty cascades**

The judge's reasoning trace contains nested hedges: "I think this might be accurate, though it's unclear if the source is reliable, but assuming the source is valid, then possibly it's a Pass, but I'm not certain." This kind of cascading uncertainty is a strong signal of an edge case.

In 2026, teams run **edge case classifiers** before running the full judge. The classifier outputs "Edge Case: Yes/No" based on the signals above. If "Yes," the case goes straight to human review without even invoking the judge. This saves inference cost on cases that will be escalated anyway.

---

## Feedback Loops: Learning from Escalated Cases

Escalation isn't just a safety valve. It's a **data source**. Every escalated case represents a failure mode: something the judge couldn't handle. Human decisions on escalated cases feed back into judge improvement.

**Calibration updates**

You escalated 1000 low-confidence cases last month. Humans reviewed them and scored 600 as Pass, 400 as Fail. Now you have 1000 new labeled examples where you know the judge was uncertain. You add these to your calibration set and retrain the judge (or update the prompt) to handle these patterns better.

**Threshold tuning**

You set the confidence threshold at 0.7 and escalated 5% of cases. Humans found that 50% of escalated cases were actually clear-cut (the judge was over-cautious). You lower the threshold to 0.65 to reduce unnecessary escalations. Conversely, if humans found that 20% of auto-approved cases were actually failures, you raise the threshold to 0.75.

**Abstention policy refinement**

You taught the judge to abstain when "context is missing." Humans review 200 abstention cases and find that 80% could have been scored correctly without the missing context. You refine the abstention rule: only abstain when specific context (e.g., conversation history) is missing, not when general background might be helpful.

**Escalation reason analysis**

You tag each escalation with a reason: "Low Confidence," "Multi-Judge Disagreement," "Novel Task," "Ambiguous Criteria." You analyze which reasons are most common (30% are "Ambiguous Criteria") and invest in fixing the root cause (clarifying the rubric, adding examples).

**Judge selection**

You run a multi-judge ensemble. You notice that Judge A escalates 10% of cases while Judge B escalates 20%. Humans find that Judge A's escalations are well-calibrated (80% are genuinely hard cases) while Judge B's escalations are noisy (50% are clear-cut). You replace Judge B with a better model or retune its prompts.

Escalation feedback loops turn your eval system into a **self-improving flywheel**: escalations generate labels, labels improve judges, better judges reduce escalations. In 2026, mature teams close this loop with automated pipelines: escalations flow into a review queue, human decisions get logged, weekly scripts retrain or retune judges based on the new data.

---

## The Confidence Calibration Problem

A well-calibrated judge is one where "90% confident" means "correct 90% of the time." If the judge says "High Confidence: Pass" on 1000 cases, roughly 950 should actually be Pass. If only 700 are Pass, the judge is overconfident. If 990 are Pass, it's underconfident.

Many judges out of the box are **poorly calibrated**. They output "High Confidence" on 80% of cases (overly optimistic) or "Low Confidence" on 70% of cases (overly cautious). This breaks your escalation logic: if everything is "High Confidence," you never escalate; if everything is "Low Confidence," you always escalate.

**Calibration checks**

Take a labeled validation set of 500 cases. Run the judge and record its confidence estimates. Bucket cases by confidence: 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, ..., 0.9-1.0. For each bucket, compute the actual accuracy. Plot confidence vs. accuracy. A well-calibrated judge produces a diagonal line (confidence = accuracy). An overconfident judge produces a curve below the diagonal (confidence higher than accuracy). An underconfident judge produces a curve above the diagonal.

**Calibration fixes**

**1. Prompt tuning**

Add phrases like "Be conservative with confidence ratings" or "Only say High Confidence if you're certain." This nudges the judge toward better calibration.

**2. Temperature adjustment**

Lower temperature (e.g., 0.3) makes the model more confident. Higher temperature (e.g., 0.7) makes it less confident. Tune temperature to match your desired calibration curve.

**3. Confidence scaling**

Post-process confidence scores with a learned transformation. If the judge outputs 0.8 but historically only 0.65 of those cases are correct, you scale 0.8 → 0.65. This is a **calibration layer** on top of the raw model output.

**4. Platt scaling**

Fit a logistic regression from raw confidence scores to actual outcomes. The regression learns the optimal mapping from uncalibrated confidence to calibrated confidence. Standard technique in ML; applies to LLM judges too.

**5. Re-sampling for consistency**

Instead of using raw logits, sample the judge multiple times and use agreement rate as confidence. If 3/3 samples agree, confidence = 1.0. If 2/3 agree, confidence = 0.67. This empirically grounds confidence in actual consistency.

In 2026, teams run monthly calibration audits. They plot calibration curves, compute expected calibration error (ECE), and retune prompts or apply scaling if ECE exceeds 0.05. Calibration is not a one-time setup; it's an ongoing discipline.

## 2026 Patterns: Active Learning, Dashboards, Adaptive Thresholds

By 2026, confidence-aware eval systems have matured into sophisticated platforms:

**Active learning for eval**

Instead of escalating random low-confidence cases, you escalate the cases that are most informative for improving the judge. You use **uncertainty sampling** (cases with confidence nearest 0.5), **diversity sampling** (cases that are dissimilar to existing labeled data), or **disagreement sampling** (cases where multiple judges disagree most). This maximizes the value of limited human review capacity.

**Confidence-aware dashboards**

Your eval dashboard shows not just pass/fail rates but confidence distributions: "80% of cases scored with High Confidence, 15% Medium, 5% Low. 3% escalated." You drill down into low-confidence cases and see common patterns (certain task types, certain model versions, certain times of day). You use this to prioritize improvements.

**Adaptive thresholds**

Confidence thresholds aren't static. During a model rollout, you temporarily raise the threshold to catch unexpected failures. During stable periods, you lower it to maximize automation. During peak traffic, you raise it to avoid overwhelming human reviewers. The threshold adapts in real-time based on system load, error rates, and business priorities.

**Confidence-weighted metrics**

Instead of reporting "overall accuracy = 92%," you report "high-confidence accuracy = 98%, low-confidence accuracy = 78%." This tells you where the system is reliable and where it struggles. You set different SLAs for different confidence buckets.

**Escalation SLA management**

You commit to reviewing all escalated cases within 24 hours. Your dashboard tracks escalation queue depth, review latency, and reviewer workload. If the queue exceeds capacity, you temporarily lower the confidence threshold to reduce incoming escalations (accepting slightly lower quality) until the backlog clears.

---

## Failure Modes

Confidence-based escalation can fail in subtle ways:

**Overconfident judges**

The judge says "High Confidence: Pass" on ambiguous cases. You trust it. You auto-approve failures. Solution: Regular calibration audits, multi-judge checks, human spot-checks on high-confidence decisions.

**Threshold drift**

You set threshold=0.7 based on last month's data. The task distribution shifts. Now 20% of cases are low-confidence instead of 5%. Your human review team is overwhelmed. Solution: Monitor escalation rates, adjust thresholds dynamically, set alerting on sudden escalation spikes.

**Escalation fatigue**

Humans review 100 escalations per day. 80% are borderline; 20% are clear-cut. Reviewers get frustrated: "Why did this even get escalated?" They start rubber-stamping the judge's tentative score. Solution: Improve edge case detection, tighten abstention rules, show judge reasoning to help reviewers understand the uncertainty.

**Feedback loop stagnation**

You collect human labels on escalated cases but never retrain the judge. The same edge cases keep getting escalated month after month. Solution: Automate calibration updates, schedule quarterly judge retraining, close the loop from escalation to improvement.

**Confidence gaming**

The judge learns that "Low Confidence" cases get human review, so it outputs "Low Confidence" on hard cases to avoid being blamed for mistakes. It becomes overly cautious, escalating 30% of cases unnecessarily. Solution: Evaluate judges on both accuracy and calibration, penalize unnecessary escalations, use multi-judge ensembles to cross-check confidence.

**Adversarial inputs**

An attacker discovers that certain input patterns trigger low confidence and escalation. They spam your system with these patterns to overwhelm human reviewers (denial-of-service via escalation). Solution: Rate-limit escalations per user, detect anomalous escalation patterns, add abuse detection before eval.

---

## Enterprise Expectations

In production environments, confidence and escalation systems must meet rigorous standards:

**Auditability**

Every escalation decision must be logged: which case, which judge, which confidence score, which threshold, which human reviewer, which final decision. Auditors can reconstruct why a case was escalated or auto-approved.

**Explainability**

Escalation tickets include the judge's reasoning, the confidence estimate, and the uncertainty factors (missing context, novel task, multi-judge disagreement). Humans understand why the case was flagged.

**Consistency**

The same case escalated twice should produce the same routing (same reviewer type, same SLA). No randomness in escalation logic unless explicitly justified (e.g., load balancing across reviewers).

**Scalability**

Confidence estimation should not double your inference cost unless the value justifies it. Single-judge explicit confidence (cheap) is preferred over multi-judge ensembles (expensive) unless quality requirements demand it.

**Reviewer experience**

Escalation queues are well-organized (sorted by priority, tagged by task type, filterable by confidence level). Reviewers can quickly understand context, make decisions, and provide feedback.

**Performance monitoring**

SLAs on escalation review latency (e.g., 90% of escalations reviewed within 24 hours). Alerting on SLA violations. Dashboards showing reviewer workload and queue depth.

In 2026, confidence-aware eval is not optional for production systems. It's the difference between brittle automation (fails on edge cases) and resilient hybrid judgment (knows when to ask for help).

## Template: Confidence-Aware Judge Prompt

```yaml
judge_prompt: |
  You are evaluating a customer support response.

  Task: Determine if the response is acceptable (Pass) or unacceptable (Fail).

  Rubric:
  - Pass if: Accurate, polite, addresses the customer's question
  - Fail if: Inaccurate, rude, ignores the customer's question

  Input: {{input}}
  Output: {{output}}

  Instructions:
  1. Read the input and output carefully
  2. Evaluate against the rubric
  3. Assign a score: Pass or Fail
  4. Rate your confidence: Low, Medium, or High
     - High: You are certain this is the correct score
     - Medium: You believe this is correct but there is some ambiguity
     - Low: You are uncertain; the case is borderline or unclear
  5. If you cannot score confidently due to missing context, ambiguous criteria,
     or novel task type, output "ABSTAIN" instead of Pass/Fail
  6. Provide brief reasoning

  Output format:
  Score: [Pass/Fail/ABSTAIN]
  Confidence: [Low/Medium/High]
  Reasoning: [1-2 sentences explaining your score and confidence]

escalation_policy:
  high_confidence: auto_approve
  medium_confidence: auto_approve  # adjust based on risk tolerance
  low_confidence: escalate_to_human
  abstain: escalate_to_human

routing:
  technical_accuracy: domain_expert_queue
  tone_safety: content_moderator_queue
  policy_interpretation: senior_reviewer_queue
  novel_task: specialist_panel
```

This template provides explicit confidence ratings, clear abstention instructions, and routing logic—the foundation of a confidence-aware eval system.

## Interview Q&A

**Q1: How do I choose between confidence-based escalation and abstention? When should the judge refuse to score vs. score with low confidence?**

Use **abstention** when the judge fundamentally cannot score the case: missing context, out-of-distribution task, contradictory rubric. Use **low-confidence escalation** when the judge can score but isn't certain: borderline cases, ambiguous phrasing, multi-dimensional tradeoffs. Abstention is stricter (smaller automation coverage) but cleaner (no tentative scores that might be misused). Low-confidence escalation is more flexible but requires careful threshold tuning. For high-risk evals, prefer abstention. For high-volume evals, prefer confidence-based routing.

**Q2: My judge outputs "High Confidence" on 90% of cases, but accuracy on those cases is only 85%. How do I fix overconfidence?**

This is a **calibration failure**. Run a calibration audit: plot stated confidence vs. actual accuracy on a labeled validation set. If the curve is below the diagonal (overconfident), apply one of these fixes: (1) Prompt tuning—add "Be conservative; only say High Confidence if you're certain." (2) Temperature adjustment—raise temperature to make the model less confident. (3) Confidence scaling—post-process "High" → "Medium" if historical accuracy is below 95%. (4) Multi-judge consistency—use agreement rate as confidence instead of stated confidence. Retest after each fix. Calibration is iterative; expect multiple rounds of tuning.

**Q3: Where should I set my confidence threshold? How do I balance automation coverage vs. quality?**

Model the **cost-quality curve**: run threshold sweeps (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), measure escalation rate and error rate at each threshold, assign dollar costs to errors and human reviews. The optimal threshold minimizes total cost = (error rate × error cost) + (escalation rate × review cost). Start with threshold=0.7 as a default, then adjust based on observed metrics. If escalation queue is overwhelmed, lower the threshold (accept more risk). If error rate is too high, raise the threshold (escalate more). Re-evaluate quarterly as models improve and business priorities shift.

**Q4: How do I route escalations to the right humans? Not all reviewers can handle all edge cases.**

Tag escalations with metadata: task type (technical, safety, legal), confidence level (low, abstain, multi-judge disagreement), risk tier (low, high, critical). Define routing rules: technical accuracy → domain experts, tone/safety → content moderators, novel tasks → specialist panels, critical risk → senior reviewers with 24h SLA. Use **active learning** to prioritize informative cases (boundary cases, diverse cases, disagreement cases). Provide escalation tickets with full context: input/output, judge reasoning, confidence estimate, rubric. Monitor reviewer workload and adjust routing to balance load. Good routing turns escalation into collaborative judgment, not blind handoff.

**Q5: How do I close the feedback loop from human decisions on escalated cases back to judge improvement?**

Automate the pipeline: (1) Log all escalations with judge tentative score, confidence, and reasoning. (2) Log human final decision and reasoning. (3) Weekly, extract disagreements (judge said Pass, human said Fail). (4) Add disagreements to calibration set as new labeled examples. (5) Retrain judge or update prompts to handle these patterns. (6) Re-run calibration audit to verify improvement. Track escalation rate over time—if judges improve, escalation rate should decrease. Track repeat patterns—if the same edge cases keep escalating, you're not learning; dig deeper into root causes (ambiguous rubric, missing context, out-of-distribution tasks). Closing the loop turns escalation from cost center to improvement engine.

## Bridge to Chapter 7.7

You've built a confidence-aware eval system. The judge estimates its own confidence, abstains when unsure, and escalates edge cases to humans. But what if you run multiple judges? When they agree, you're confident. When they disagree, you escalate. But what if two judges agree and one dissents? How do you measure agreement rigorously? How do you know if disagreement signals ambiguity or poor judge quality?

Chapter 7.7 covers **Judge Agreement and Meta-Evaluation**—the methods for measuring consistency across judges, detecting systematic biases, and evaluating the evaluators themselves. If confidence is about knowing when to trust a single judge, agreement is about knowing when to trust a panel. Let's formalize it.
