# Chapter 3.10 — Risk Tier Misclassification: The Mistakes That Kill Products

Getting your risk tier wrong is one of the most expensive mistakes in AI product development. And it happens constantly — not because teams are careless, but because risk classification requires judgment calls that are easy to get wrong.

### Under-Classification: Treating High Risk as Low

This is the dangerous direction. Your product is Tier 3 but you're operating like Tier 1.

**How it happens:**

- "It's just a suggestion, the user makes the final decision." True for some products, but if users routinely follow the suggestion without independent verification — which they will — the AI is effectively making the decision.

- "We're only doing internal testing right now." Internal testing with plans to go customer-facing next quarter. But the evaluation infrastructure, monitoring, and safety systems for customer-facing aren't being built in parallel.

- "It's not a medical device, it's a wellness app." Regulatory boundaries are blurry. An app that says "you might have condition X" might be classified as a medical device by the FDA regardless of how you brand it.

- "We're in a jurisdiction where this isn't regulated." Regulations follow users, not companies. If your product serves EU users, the EU AI Act applies. If it processes US health data, HIPAA applies. Geographic assumptions about regulatory scope are frequently wrong.

**What happens:** You ship a product without adequate evaluation, monitoring, or safety infrastructure. Something goes wrong. The incident is more severe than your systems can handle. Regulators get involved. The product gets pulled. The company faces liability. This isn't hypothetical — in 2025-2026, multiple companies faced enforcement actions for AI products that weren't appropriately classified.

### Over-Classification: Treating Low Risk as High

This is the expensive direction. Your product is Tier 1 but you're operating like Tier 3.

**How it happens:**

- "We need to be safe." Safety is good. But applying Tier 3 safety protocols to an internal summarization tool means you spend six months on compliance documentation for a product that helps employees read emails faster.

- "The legal team wants full risk assessment." Legal teams naturally default to maximum caution. That's their job. But the engineering team's job is to push back with a proportionate risk analysis. A proportionate assessment of a Tier 1 product should take hours, not months.

- "What if it goes customer-facing someday?" Design for the tier you're at, not the tier you might be at in the future. Build upgrade paths, not premature infrastructure.

**What happens:** Your competitors ship in four weeks. You ship in four months. By the time your over-engineered Tier 1 product launches, the market has moved on. Over-classification doesn't protect you — it paralyzes you.

### The Classification Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Classifying by intent, not by impact.**
You intended the product for low-risk use. But users use it for high-risk decisions. A general-purpose AI assistant intended for drafting emails gets used by employees to answer customer legal questions. Your intent doesn't determine your risk — your users' behavior does.

**Mistake 2: Classifying at launch and never re-assessing.**
Your product was Tier 1 when it launched internally. Then it went customer-facing (Tier 2). Then it started handling financial data (Tier 3). But your evaluation and monitoring infrastructure never upgraded. Risk tiers change as products evolve.

**Mistake 3: Classifying the feature, not the system.**
The AI feature is low-risk. But it's embedded in a high-risk workflow. An AI-powered search feature is Tier 1 on its own. Embedded in a medical records system, it inherits the system's risk tier.

**Mistake 4: Assuming the model provider handles risk.**
"We use OpenAI/Anthropic, so safety is handled." No. The model provider handles model-level safety. You handle product-level safety — input validation, output filtering, use-case-specific guardrails, monitoring, and compliance. The provider's safety measures are a foundation, not a complete solution.

### The Re-Classification Trigger List

Re-assess your risk tier whenever:
- The product moves from internal to customer-facing
- You enter a new industry or regulatory jurisdiction
- The product starts handling sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial)
- Users start using the product for decisions it wasn't designed for
- The product gains agent capabilities (tool use, actions)
- A new regulation takes effect that covers your use case
- You have a significant quality incident

Keep a calendar reminder to formally re-assess every six months, even if nothing has obviously changed. Risk creep is real, and it's invisible until something breaks.
