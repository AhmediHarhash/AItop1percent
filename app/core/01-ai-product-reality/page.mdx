# Section 1 — AI Product Reality & Risk Tiers

This is where everything starts — not with models, not with prompts, not with frameworks. With reality.

Most AI projects fail. Not because the technology is wrong, but because teams skip the hard thinking that happens before the first line of code. They build demos that dazzle executives, pick models before defining problems, and ship products without understanding what "good" even means for their users.

This section is your foundation. We cover what AI products actually are (and aren't), the different shapes they take, how to classify risk so you don't over-engineer or under-protect, who needs to be on the team, how to scope requirements that won't collapse on contact with reality, what the competitive landscape actually looks like in 2026, and how to get from a blank page to your first real evaluation.

If you skip this section, you'll build faster — and fail faster too.

## What You'll Learn

- **Chapter 1 — What AI Products Actually Are:** The gap between demos and deployable products, why most projects fail, and the honest decision framework for when AI is (and isn't) the right choice.

- **Chapter 2 — AI Product Categories & Archetypes:** The nine product shapes you'll encounter — from chatbots to agents to multimodal systems — and why the archetype determines your entire technical strategy.

- **Chapter 3 — Risk Tiers & Why They Matter:** A practical risk framework that goes beyond safety into regulatory, operational, and business risk — including EU AI Act tiers, GPAI model obligations, and data residency.

- **Chapter 4 — The AI Product Team:** Who owns what, how AI changes the PM/Eng/ML dynamic, why domain experts matter more than you think, and the human operations most teams forget.

- **Chapter 5 — Scoping & Requirements for AI Products:** Why traditional PRDs fail for AI, how to write requirements that survive contact with probabilistic systems, threat modeling, SLOs, unit economics, and explainability.

- **Chapter 6 — Market Reality & Competitive Landscape:** Commoditization, vendor lock-in, provider resilience, and how to differentiate when everyone has access to the same foundation models.

- **Chapter 7 — From Idea to First Eval:** The practical first steps — picking a use case, building your first eval set, setting thresholds, creating the feedback flywheel, and knowing when to kill a project early.
