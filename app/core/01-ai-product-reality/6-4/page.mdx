# Chapter 6.4 — Open Source vs Proprietary: The Real Tradeoffs

"Just use open source — it's free!" This is one of the most common and most dangerous oversimplifications in AI product development. Open-source models are powerful, increasingly capable, and genuinely transformative. They're also not free, not always better, and not right for every use case.

Let's walk through the real tradeoffs so you can make this decision with your eyes open.

### Where Open Source Wins

**Cost at scale.** When you're making millions of API calls per month, the savings from running your own model are significant. A self-hosted Llama 3 instance might cost 60-80% less per query than an equivalent proprietary API at high volume. The breakeven point depends on your volume, but for high-traffic products, the math favors self-hosting.

**Data control.** When you self-host, your data never leaves your infrastructure. For healthcare, financial services, defense, and government use cases, this isn't a preference — it's a requirement. No API terms of service to worry about. No data processing agreements to negotiate. Your data, your servers, your rules.

**Customization depth.** You can fine-tune open-source models on your specific data, modify the architecture, adjust the tokenizer, and optimize for your exact use case. With proprietary APIs, you get fine-tuning endpoints (limited) and prompting. With open source, you get the full model.

**No vendor dependency.** Nobody can deprecate your model, change your pricing, or update your terms of service. You control the version, the deployment, and the lifecycle.

### Where Proprietary Wins

**Raw capability.** As of early 2026, the frontier proprietary models (GPT-4-class, Claude 3.5-class, Gemini Ultra-class) still outperform open-source alternatives on the hardest reasoning tasks. The gap has narrowed — dramatically — but it hasn't closed for every use case. If you need peak performance on complex reasoning, proprietary models still lead.

**Speed to production.** An API call is one line of code. Self-hosting a model requires GPU infrastructure, model serving software, load balancing, monitoring, and ML ops expertise. If you're a small team that needs to ship fast, the API gets you to market months sooner.

**Managed infrastructure.** The model provider handles scaling, redundancy, hardware failures, and model updates. You handle your product. For teams without ML infrastructure expertise, this division of labor is valuable.

**Safety and alignment.** Frontier proprietary models have undergone extensive safety training, red teaming, and alignment work. Open-source models vary widely in their safety properties. If your product is high-risk, the safety investment in proprietary models has real value.

### The Hybrid Approach

Most mature AI products in 2026 use both. A common pattern:

- **Proprietary API** for the hardest, highest-value tasks (complex reasoning, nuanced generation)
- **Open-source model** for high-volume, simpler tasks (classification, extraction, embeddings)
- **Open-source fallback** when the proprietary API is down or throttled

This gives you the best of both: frontier capability where it matters, cost efficiency where it doesn't, and resilience when things go wrong.

### The Decision Framework

Choose **proprietary API** when: you need frontier capability, you're moving fast with a small team, your volume is low-to-moderate, or you lack ML infrastructure expertise.

Choose **open source** when: your volume is high, data sovereignty is required, you need deep customization, or you're building in a regulated industry that prohibits external data processing.

Choose **hybrid** when: you've reached a scale where cost optimization matters but you still need frontier capability for some tasks. This is where most successful products end up.

The decision isn't permanent. Many products start with proprietary APIs, prove product-market fit, then migrate high-volume workloads to open source as they scale. Start where you can move fastest. Optimize when it matters.
