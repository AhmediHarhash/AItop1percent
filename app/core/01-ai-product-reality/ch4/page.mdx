# Chapter 4 — The AI Product Team

You can have the best model, the best data, and the best evaluation framework — and still fail because the wrong people are making the wrong decisions.

AI product teams are different from traditional software teams. They need roles that don't exist in conventional engineering orgs, decision-making processes that account for probabilistic behavior, and communication patterns that bridge the gap between ML engineers who think in loss functions and product managers who think in user stories.

This chapter covers who you need, what they own, how they work together, and the communication patterns that prevent the failures that kill most AI projects. Whether you're a founder building your first AI team or a VP restructuring an existing org, this is your playbook.

## What This Chapter Covers

- **4.1** — Who owns what (PM, engineering, ML, QA, legal — the RACI)
- **4.2** — The AI product manager role in 2026
- **4.3** — ML engineers vs AI engineers vs software engineers
- **4.4** — Where evaluation ownership lives
- **4.5** — Cross-functional decision making
- **4.6** — The role of domain experts
- **4.7** — Building vs hiring (team composition at each stage)
- **4.8** — Communication patterns that prevent failures
- **4.9** — Human-in-the-loop operations (escalation, support, moderation)

The technology is the easy part. The team is the hard part. Get this right, and the rest follows.

*Let's start with who owns what — because unclear ownership is where AI projects go to die.*
