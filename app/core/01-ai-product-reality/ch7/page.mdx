# Chapter 7 — From Idea to First Eval

Everything in the previous six chapters was preparation. This chapter is execution.

You have an idea for an AI product. You understand the category, the risk tier, the team structure, the requirements, and the market. Now it's time to make something real — and more importantly, to prove that it works.

The path from idea to first evaluation is shorter than most teams think. Within 48 hours, you should have a working prototype. Within a week, you should have a quality baseline measured with real numbers. Within a month, you should be in production with real users.

This chapter walks you through that path step by step — from prototype to evaluation to model selection to prompt architecture to your first deployment. No theory. Just the practical playbook for getting an AI product into the world.
