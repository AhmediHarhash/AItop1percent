# Chapter 3.8 — How Risk Tier Dictates Your Release Process

Your release process is the last gate between your AI system and the real world. Get it right and you ship confidently. Get it wrong and you ship hopefully — which is another word for recklessly.

### Tier 1 Release: Ship and Watch

At Tier 1, speed matters more than ceremony.

**Process:** Developer merges the change, runs the basic eval set, confirms results look reasonable, deploys. No formal approval needed.

**Rollback plan:** If users report issues, revert the change. Since it's internal and human-reviewed, the blast radius of a bad deploy is small.

**Monitoring after release:** Check usage metrics and user feedback within the first day. If nobody complains and usage is normal, move on.

This isn't sloppy — it's appropriately calibrated. Over-engineering the release process for a Tier 1 product slows you down without meaningfully reducing risk.

### Tier 2 Release: Gate and Verify

At Tier 2, you need confidence before customers see the change.

**Process:**
1. Run the full eval set. Compare results to the previous version.
2. Check that all metrics meet defined thresholds (accuracy, safety, latency, cost).
3. If any metric regresses beyond an acceptable margin, block the release.
4. Deploy to a canary group (1-5% of traffic) for 24-48 hours.
5. Monitor canary metrics. If stable, roll out to 100%.
6. Post-release monitoring for 72 hours with tighter alerting thresholds.

**Rollback plan:** Automated rollback if error rate exceeds threshold during canary. One-click rollback capability for the full release.

**Monitoring after release:** Daily quality sampling for the first week. Return to normal monitoring cadence after that.

The key at Tier 2 is the canary. It's your safety net. A 2% regression that's invisible in eval data becomes obvious when 5% of real traffic hits the new version for 24 hours.

### Tier 3 Release: Multi-Stage with Expert Sign-Off

At Tier 3, no single person can approve a release.

**Process:**
1. Full eval suite run with results documented.
2. Domain expert review of a random sample of outputs from the new version.
3. Bias audit comparing performance across demographic groups.
4. Red team testing session to probe for new failure modes.
5. Engineering sign-off: infrastructure, monitoring, and rollback are ready.
6. Product sign-off: change aligns with product strategy and user needs.
7. Legal/compliance sign-off: no new regulatory concerns.
8. Staged rollout: 1% → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%, with a minimum monitoring period at each stage.

**Rollback plan:** Automated rollback at any stage if quality metrics drop below threshold. Manual rollback authority held by the on-call engineer with explicit criteria documented.

**Monitoring after release:** Real-time quality monitoring for 14 days post-release. Domain expert review of a production sample at day 3 and day 7. Full quality report at day 14.

The Tier 3 release process is deliberately slow. Rushing a release in a high-risk domain isn't bold — it's negligent. The cost of a one-week delay is nothing compared to the cost of a quality incident affecting patients, financial clients, or legal outcomes.

### Tier 4 Release: Regulatory Compliance Gate

At Tier 4, everything from Tier 3, plus:

**Pre-release regulatory package.** Before deployment, assemble the complete documentation required by the applicable regulation: technical file (EU AI Act), validation study (FDA), risk assessment, and conformity declaration.

**Regulatory notification or approval.** Some regulations require notification or approval before a new version is deployed. Build the regulatory timeline into your release schedule — this can add weeks or months.

**Post-market surveillance plan.** Document how you'll monitor the system in production, how you'll detect and report serious incidents, and how you'll handle mandatory adverse event reporting.

**Change control.** The FDA's predetermined change control plan (PCCP) framework requires you to define in advance what kinds of changes you'll make and how you'll validate them. Deviating from the plan may require a new regulatory submission.

### The Release Maturity Path

Most teams start at Tier 1 release processes and evolve. That's fine — as long as your release process matches your current risk tier.

The danger is when your product's risk tier has graduated from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or Tier 3, but your release process hasn't. You're shipping high-risk changes with a low-risk process. That gap is where incidents live.

Every time your product's risk profile changes — new customer segment, new use case, new geography, new regulation — reassess whether your release process still matches.
