# 3.8 — How Risk Tier Dictates Your Release Process

In September 2024, a SaaS company shipped a new version of their AI-powered customer support assistant. The previous version had taken three months to develop and another month to release through their standard process: staging environment testing, canary deployment, gradual rollout, monitoring at each stage. The engineering team decided the new release process was too slow. They simplified it. The new version went from merge to production in four hours. Within twelve hours, customer support tickets spiked by three hundred percent. The new version was hallucinating product features that did not exist, generating incorrect billing information, and occasionally switching languages mid-conversation. The team rolled back. The incident cost them two days of firefighting, thousands of frustrated customers, and a trust penalty that took months to recover from. The old release process had not been too slow. It had been correctly calibrated to a Tier 2 product. The new release process was appropriate for Tier 1, but they were not building Tier 1.

Your release process is the last gate between your AI system and the real world. It is the moment when all your design decisions, all your evaluation work, all your testing either protects you or fails you. Get the release process right and you ship confidently, knowing that you have caught the obvious problems and have the mechanisms in place to catch the non-obvious ones quickly. Get it wrong and you ship hopefully, which is another word for recklessly. Hope is not a strategy. Your release process must match your risk tier, not your schedule, not your executive's impatience, not your competitor's pace.

## Tier 1 Release Means Ship and Watch

At Tier 1, your product is internal, experimental, or human-reviewed before any action is taken. The blast radius of a bad release is small. A confused employee can ask a colleague. An incorrect draft can be edited before it is sent. A broken feature in an experimental tool is annoying but not damaging. Your release process should optimize for speed and learning, not for ceremony and gates.

The process is simple. A developer writes the code, updates the prompt, or changes the model configuration. They run the evaluation set, which at Tier 1 is fifty to one hundred examples reviewed manually. If the results look reasonable, they merge the change. The change goes to production. There is no formal approval process. There is no multi-day canary period. There is no staged rollout. The developer who made the change is responsible for watching it in production for the first day or two.

What does watching mean? Check the usage metrics. Is anyone using the feature? Are they using it more or less than before? Check the error rates. Is the system returning more errors than usual? Check user feedback. If you have a thumbs up or thumbs down mechanism, are users voting down the new outputs more frequently? If you have a support channel or a Slack thread where users report issues, are there complaints? If everything looks normal and no one is complaining, the release is successful. Move on to the next thing.

If something is wrong, fix it. At Tier 1, you do not need an incident response process. You do not need an on-call rotation. You do not need a formal rollback procedure. If the change broke something, revert it. If the change made the product worse but did not break it, decide whether to iterate or revert. Make the decision quickly. This is Tier 1. The stakes are low. The cost of a revert is a few minutes of engineering time.

This release process is not sloppy. It is appropriately calibrated for low-risk products. Over-engineering your release process for Tier 1 slows you down, adds friction to iteration, and prevents you from learning quickly. The whole point of Tier 1 is to move fast and discover what works. A release process that takes a week defeats that purpose.

## Tier 2 Release Means Gate and Verify

At Tier 2, your product is customer-facing. Customers are paying you money, trusting your brand, and integrating your product into their workflows. A bad release frustrates customers, generates support tickets, damages your reputation, and potentially costs you revenue. Your release process must provide confidence that the change improves the product or at minimum does not make it worse.

The process starts with evaluation. Before a change can be released, the full evaluation set must be run. At Tier 2, this is two hundred to five hundred examples with automated scoring for measurable dimensions and human or LLM-as-judge review for subjective dimensions. The results are compared to the previous version. If any metric regresses beyond an acceptable margin, the release is blocked. Define these margins in advance. A two percent drop in accuracy might be acceptable if latency improved by fifty percent. A ten percent drop in accuracy is never acceptable. Write down the rules. Automate the checks. Do not leave the decision to human judgment in the moment.

If the evaluation passes, the change moves to a canary deployment. Deploy the new version to a small percentage of production traffic, typically one to five percent. Monitor the canary group for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. What are you monitoring? Error rates, latency, user feedback, quality scores on sampled traffic, and any business metrics that matter to your product. If your product is an AI writing assistant, monitor completion rates and user edits. If your product is a recommendation engine, monitor click-through rates and conversion rates. If your product is a customer support assistant, monitor resolution rates and customer satisfaction scores.

The canary period is your safety net. A regression that is invisible in your evaluation set becomes obvious when five percent of real traffic hits the new version for twenty-four hours. Real users do things your evaluation set does not cover. Real user behavior is distributed differently than your evaluation examples. Real production load exposes latency issues, rate limiting issues, and edge cases that your staging environment misses. The canary catches these issues before they affect all your customers.

If the canary metrics are stable and within acceptable ranges, expand the rollout. Move from five percent to twenty-five percent, then fifty percent, then one hundred percent. At each stage, monitor for a few hours to a day before expanding further. If at any stage the metrics degrade, halt the rollout. Investigate. Either fix the issue and resume, or roll back entirely.

You need a one-click rollback capability. This is non-negotiable at Tier 2. If something goes wrong, you must be able to revert to the previous version in less than thirty minutes. This means infrastructure that supports instant version switching, configuration that allows rollbacks without code changes, and monitoring that alerts you immediately when metrics cross thresholds. Test your rollback mechanism regularly. If you have never performed a rollback in production, you do not know whether it works.

After the release completes, continue monitoring for seventy-two hours with tighter alerting thresholds. New issues sometimes emerge only after the system has been running at full load for a day or two. After seventy-two hours, if metrics remain stable, return to your normal monitoring cadence.

The Tier 2 release process takes days, not hours. This is intentional. The canary period is doing real work. It is catching issues that evaluation missed. The staged rollout is limiting your blast radius. If you discover a problem at twenty-five percent rollout, you have affected a quarter of your customers, not all of them. The difference matters.

## Tier 3 Release Means Multi-Stage with Expert Sign-Off

At Tier 3, your product makes decisions that affect user safety, user money, or user legal standing. A bad release does not just frustrate users. It harms them. Your release process must ensure that harm does not occur and must provide evidence, if questioned, that you exercised due diligence.

No single person can approve a Tier 3 release. The decision must involve multiple stakeholders, each reviewing from their domain of expertise. Engineering reviews the technical implementation, the infrastructure readiness, the monitoring coverage, and the rollback plan. Product reviews whether the change aligns with product strategy, whether it serves user needs, and whether it maintains the expected user experience. Domain experts review whether the outputs are correct according to the standards of the domain. If you are building a medical AI, physicians review clinical correctness. If you are building a financial AI, financial analysts or compliance officers review financial accuracy and regulatory compliance. If you are building a legal AI, lawyers review legal soundness. Legal and compliance teams review whether the change introduces new regulatory risks, new liability exposures, or new compliance obligations.

Each stakeholder must explicitly sign off. Document the sign-offs. If a regulator or a plaintiff's attorney later asks who approved the release, you must be able to produce the record.

Before sign-off can happen, several work products must be complete. First, the full evaluation suite must pass. At Tier 3, this is a thousand-plus examples validated by domain experts, with multi-layered evaluation including automated checks, domain expert review, red team testing, and bias audits. Second, a random sample of outputs from the new version must be reviewed by domain experts. The sample size depends on your domain and your risk tolerance, but it is typically fifty to two hundred examples. The experts are not just checking whether the outputs are correct. They are checking whether the outputs are safe, whether they meet professional standards, and whether they expose any new failure modes. Third, a bias audit must confirm that performance across demographic groups has not regressed and ideally has improved. Fourth, a red team testing session must confirm that adversarial robustness has not degraded. Fifth, all monitoring, alerting, and rollback mechanisms must be tested and confirmed operational.

Only after all these work products are complete and all stakeholders have signed off does the staged rollout begin. Deploy the new version to one percent of traffic. Monitor continuously. At Tier 3, monitoring is not a dashboard you check once a day. It is real-time alerting on quality metrics, error rates, safety violations, and any domain-specific metrics that indicate harm. If any metric crosses a threshold, the system alerts immediately. A human reviews. The human decides whether to continue, to pause and investigate, or to roll back.

If the one percent deployment is stable for a minimum period, typically twenty-four to forty-eight hours, expand to five percent. Monitor again. If stable, expand to twenty-five percent. Monitor again. If stable, expand to fifty percent. Monitor again. If stable, expand to one hundred percent. At each stage, the minimum monitoring period must pass before you expand further. Do not rush. The cost of a one-week delay is trivial compared to the cost of a quality incident that harms users.

In addition to automated monitoring, domain experts must review a sample of production outputs at each stage. At the five percent stage, review fifty examples. At the twenty-five percent stage, review another fifty. At the fifty percent stage, review another fifty. This expert review catches issues that automated monitoring misses. Automated metrics can tell you that accuracy is stable. They cannot tell you that the system is technically correct but clinically inappropriate, or that the tone has shifted in a way that undermines user trust.

After the release reaches one hundred percent, monitoring continues at elevated intensity for fourteen days. Real-time alerting remains active. Domain experts review production samples at day three, day seven, and day fourteen. A full quality report is produced at day fourteen. Only after fourteen days of stable operation do you return to normal monitoring cadence.

The Tier 3 release process is deliberately slow. It takes weeks from the decision to release to full deployment. Executives will pressure you to move faster. Resist. Explain that the staged rollout is not bureaucracy. It is risk management. Each stage is a checkpoint where you can catch issues before they reach all users. The canary at one percent limits your blast radius to one percent of users. The expansion to five percent confirms that the issue was not a one percent statistical fluke. The expansion to twenty-five percent confirms that the issue does not emerge at moderate scale. The expansion to fifty percent confirms that the issue does not emerge at high scale. Every stage is doing work.

If an executive insists on skipping stages or compressing timelines, document the conversation. Explain the risks. If they persist, escalate to the CEO, the board, or legal counsel. Rushing a Tier 3 release is not bold decision-making. It is professional negligence. If harm occurs, the executive who pushed for speed will not be held accountable. You will be.

## Tier 4 Release Means Regulatory Compliance Gate

At Tier 4, your product is subject to regulatory oversight. Your release process must not only protect users but also satisfy regulators. Everything from Tier 3 applies, plus several additional requirements.

Before you can deploy a new version to production, you must assemble a regulatory documentation package. The contents depend on the regulation, but typically include a technical file describing the system, the validation study demonstrating that the system meets performance requirements, the risk assessment documenting the risks and mitigations, and the conformity declaration stating that the system complies with applicable regulations. For EU AI Act high-risk systems, this package must conform to Articles 9 through 15 and Annex IV. For FDA-regulated software as a medical device, this package must conform to FDA guidance on software validation and the predetermined change control plan framework.

Some regulations require you to notify the regulator before deploying a new version. Some require approval. Build the regulatory timeline into your release schedule. Regulatory notification can take days. Regulatory approval can take weeks or months. If you assume you can deploy immediately after your internal release process completes, you will be surprised and delayed.

Your post-market surveillance plan must be documented and operational. This plan describes how you will monitor the system in production, how you will detect serious incidents, how you will investigate incidents, and how you will report incidents to regulators. The EU AI Act requires providers of high-risk systems to report serious incidents to authorities without undue delay. The FDA requires medical device manufacturers to report adverse events within timelines that vary by severity. Your monitoring infrastructure must support these reporting obligations. If a serious incident occurs, you must detect it immediately, investigate it quickly, and report it within the regulatory timeline. If your monitoring is slow or your investigation process is ad hoc, you will miss the deadline.

Many regulations require you to maintain an audit trail of all changes. Every model version, every prompt version, every configuration change must be logged with full traceability. The log must record who made the change, when they made it, why they made it, what approvals were obtained, and what validation was performed. If a regulator audits you two years from now and asks what version was running on a specific date, you must be able to answer instantly.

Some regulations, particularly in medical devices, allow you to define a predetermined change control plan. This plan specifies in advance what kinds of changes you will make, how you will validate them, and what the release process will be. If you follow the plan, you can deploy changes without submitting a new regulatory filing for each change. This is a powerful tool for maintaining release velocity in a regulated environment. But it requires discipline. If you deviate from the plan, even slightly, you may trigger a requirement for a new regulatory submission. Document your plan carefully. Follow it exactly. Audit your compliance regularly.

The Tier 4 release process can take months from the decision to release to full deployment. This is the reality of operating in a regulated environment. The process is slow because regulators require evidence that you are not putting users at risk. The evidence takes time to produce. You cannot shortcut it. Plan accordingly. If your business model assumes you can release new features every week, and you are subject to Tier 4 regulations, your business model is wrong. Adjust it before you scale.

## Match the Process to the Tier, Then Evolve

Most products start at Tier 1 and evolve. You build an internal tool. It works. You make it customer-facing. It becomes Tier 2. You add a new use case that affects user money or safety. It becomes Tier 3. You expand to a regulated geography. It becomes Tier 4. Your release process must evolve with your risk tier.

The danger is not starting at Tier 1. The danger is staying at Tier 1 when your product has graduated to Tier 2 or Tier 3. You are shipping high-risk changes with a low-risk process. The gap between your actual risk and your process risk is where incidents happen.

Every time your product's risk profile changes, reassess your release process. Did you add a new customer segment? Did you enter a new geography? Did you add a new use case? Did a new regulation become applicable? If yes, reassess your tier. If your tier increased, upgrade your release process immediately. Do not wait for the next release cycle. Do not wait for the next planning meeting. Upgrade now.

The upgrade does not have to be perfect on day one. If you are moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2, start by adding a canary deployment. You do not need the full multi-stakeholder sign-off process yet. That comes when you move to Tier 3. Build incrementally. But build deliberately. Each tier increase requires specific changes to your process. Do not skip them.

Your release process is not overhead. It is not bureaucracy. It is not an obstacle to velocity. It is the mechanism that allows you to ship confidently. A well-designed release process catches issues before they reach all users, limits blast radius when issues do occur, and provides the evidence you need to demonstrate that you acted responsibly. The time you invest in your release process is paid back many times over in incidents you avoid, customers you retain, and regulatory penalties you never face.

Next, we examine how risk tier dictates the depth and cost of monitoring you need in production.
