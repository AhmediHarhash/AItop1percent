# Chapter 6 — Market Reality & Competitive Landscape

You can build the perfect AI product and still fail — because the market wasn't ready, the competition was insurmountable, or your differentiation evaporated overnight when the foundation model provider shipped the same feature for free.

AI markets move faster than any technology market in history. Models improve quarterly. New competitors appear weekly. Platform providers absorb startup innovations monthly. The window between "novel product" and "commoditized feature" is measured in months, not years.

This chapter is about understanding the market you're building into — so you can build something that lasts, not just something that launches.
