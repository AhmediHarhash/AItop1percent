# Chapter 1.4 — The Build, Buy, or API Decision

Every AI product team faces this choice early on, and most make it too fast. Someone on the team has a preference — usually based on what they've used before, not what's right for this product — and the decision gets made in a meeting without anyone writing down the tradeoffs.

That's how you end up locked into a vendor you can't afford, or building infrastructure you don't have the team to maintain.

### The Three Paths

**Path 1: Build (train or fine-tune your own model).**
You own the model. You control the weights, the training data, the inference stack. You can optimize for your specific use case in ways no general-purpose API can match.

When this makes sense:
- Your use case is so specific that general models perform poorly even with good prompting
- You have proprietary data that gives you a real advantage when baked into the model
- Regulatory or security requirements mean data can't leave your infrastructure
- You have the ML team to build, train, evaluate, and maintain the model long-term

When this backfires:
- You underestimate the ongoing cost of model maintenance, retraining, and infrastructure
- Your "proprietary data advantage" turns out to be 500 labeled examples that don't move the needle
- Your ML team of two is now spending 80% of their time on infrastructure instead of product improvement

**Path 2: Buy (use a commercial AI platform or product).**
You license a product like AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or a vertical AI platform built for your industry.

When this makes sense:
- You need AI capabilities but they're not your core differentiator
- You want managed infrastructure, compliance certifications, and SLAs
- Your team is product-focused, not ML-focused
- Time to market matters more than customization

When this backfires:
- The platform doesn't support your specific use case, and you spend months in "custom configuration" that's really building from scratch anyway
- You're paying platform margins on top of model costs, and your unit economics don't work at scale
- The vendor's roadmap diverges from your needs, and you have no leverage

**Path 3: API (call a foundation model API directly).**
You use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or similar APIs. You own the application logic, prompts, and orchestration. The model provider owns the model.

When this makes sense:
- You want to move fast and validate a use case before committing to infrastructure
- General-purpose models perform well enough for your task with good prompting and RAG
- You want to swap models easily as the landscape evolves
- Your differentiation is in the application layer, not the model layer

When this backfires:
- You build your entire product on one provider's API, then they deprecate the model, change pricing, or modify behavior in a way that breaks your product
- You don't plan for latency, rate limits, or outages, and your product goes down when the API does
- You assume API costs will stay constant, but your usage patterns trigger much higher bills than projected

### The Decision Framework

Don't make this choice based on vibes. Walk through these five factors:

**1. Differentiation.** Is the model itself your competitive advantage, or is it the experience you build around it? If it's the model, lean toward Build. If it's the experience, API or Buy will get you there faster.

**2. Data.** Do you have proprietary data that meaningfully improves model performance? Not "we have some data" — but data that creates a measurable quality gap between a fine-tuned model and a prompted general model. If not, Build probably isn't worth it yet.

**3. Team.** Do you have ML engineers who can train, evaluate, and operate models in production? Not researchers who've published papers — production ML engineers. If not, you're not ready to Build.

**4. Compliance.** Do regulations require you to keep data on-premise, explain model decisions, or maintain audit trails that API providers can't support? This might force you toward Build or a specific Buy platform.

**5. Economics.** Model the cost at your target scale. API costs per token times your projected query volume. Build costs including compute, storage, engineering time, and ongoing maintenance. Buy costs including license fees, usage charges, and integration effort. The cheapest option at 1,000 queries per day might be the most expensive at 1,000,000.

### The Real Answer: Start API, Earn Your Way to Build

For most teams in 2026, the right path is: start with APIs, validate the use case, build a real eval framework, then decide if the data and economics justify building or fine-tuning your own model.

The worst outcome is spending six months building a model from scratch only to discover the use case doesn't work — something you could have learned in two weeks with an API prototype.
