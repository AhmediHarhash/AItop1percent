# Chapter 4.7 — Building vs Hiring: Team Composition at Each Stage

The biggest team-building mistake in AI is staffing for the future instead of the present. Companies raise funding, hire a team of ten ML engineers, and then realize they need product-market fit before they need model optimization. Meanwhile, they're burning $200K/month on payroll for capabilities they won't use for a year.

Build the team for the stage you're at. Add capabilities as you earn the right to need them.

### Stage 1: Prototype (1-3 People)

**What you need:** One AI engineer who can prompt, evaluate, and build a basic application. Optionally, one software engineer if the AI engineer isn't strong on application development.

**What you don't need:** ML engineers, data scientists, QA specialists, or domain experts on staff. Use contractors or advisors for domain validation.

**The profile:** A full-stack AI engineer — someone who can write prompts, set up a basic eval, build an API, and deploy it. In 2026, this profile is the most valuable hire in AI. They're not deep specialists in any one area, but they can move fast across the entire stack.

**Build or hire:** Hire the AI engineer. Build everything else yourself or with contractors.

### Stage 2: MVP (3-6 People)

**What you need:** The prototype team plus software engineering depth (the application needs to be reliable, not just functional), a PM (someone needs to own the problem definition and user validation), and regular access to domain expertise.

**What you're adding:**
- Software engineer(s) to harden the application
- PM to own the product direction and quality definition
- Domain expert access (contractor, advisor, or part-time)

**What you don't need yet:** A dedicated ML engineer (unless your use case genuinely requires custom model training), a full QA team, or a compliance officer.

**Build or hire:** Hire core roles. Use contractors for domain expertise and specialized skills you need intermittently.

---

### Stage 3: Production (6-15 People)

**What you need:** A team that can build, ship, evaluate, and operate the product reliably.

**What you're adding:**
- Evaluation specialist or AI engineer focused on eval infrastructure
- Additional software engineers for scaling, monitoring, and reliability
- Domain expert (part-time or full-time depending on risk tier)
- For Tier 3+: legal/compliance resource

**The key transition:** At this stage, evaluation becomes a dedicated function. The person building the eval framework shouldn't also be designing prompts and building features. Split these responsibilities.

**Build or hire:** Build your core team. Still use contractors for periodic needs: security audits, compliance reviews, specialized domain validation.

---

### Stage 4: Scale (15+ People)

**What you're adding:**
- ML engineer(s) if you're fine-tuning or training models
- Platform engineers for shared AI infrastructure
- Dedicated evaluation team or eval platform lead
- Data engineers for training and evaluation data pipelines
- Trust and safety specialist
- For Tier 4: dedicated compliance team

**The key transition:** At this stage, you might split into sub-teams: model/ML team, product/application team, evaluation/quality team, and platform/infrastructure team. The coordination overhead grows, but so does your capability.

### The Hiring Priorities at Each Stage

| Stage | Most Critical Hire | Second Priority | Defer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prototype | Full-stack AI engineer | — | ML engineer, QA, legal |
| MVP | PM + software engineer | Domain advisor | ML engineer, compliance |
| Production | Eval specialist | Domain expert | ML engineer (unless data supports it) |
| Scale | ML engineer (if data warrants) | Platform engineer | — |

### The Contractor Strategy

Not everything needs a full-time hire. Use contractors and advisors for:
- **Domain expertise** during prototype and MVP (weekly review sessions)
- **Security audits** at production stage (quarterly)
- **Compliance reviews** before entering regulated markets (project-based)
- **Red team testing** before major launches (project-based)
- **Specialized ML work** if you need one-time fine-tuning but not ongoing ML capacity

Contractors are cheaper than premature hires and more flexible. The right time to convert a contractor to full-time is when the work is continuous and core to your product — not when you hope it will be someday.
