# Chapter 2.4 — Extraction & Structuring Products (Parsing, Entity Recognition, Summarization)

Extraction products are the unsung heroes of AI in production. They're not flashy. Nobody writes blog posts about them. But they quietly power some of the highest-ROI AI deployments in enterprise today, because they solve a problem every organization has: turning unstructured mess into structured data.

### What Extraction Products Do

Your organization is drowning in unstructured data. Emails, contracts, invoices, medical records, research papers, customer feedback, support transcripts. Somewhere in that mess is the information you need — a name, a date, a dollar amount, a sentiment, a key clause, a summary.

Extraction products pull that information out and structure it so humans and systems can use it.

**Entity extraction** finds specific pieces of information: names, dates, addresses, dollar amounts, product IDs, medical codes. "Find every company name and contract value mentioned in these 10,000 legal documents."

**Document parsing** understands document structure: headers, sections, tables, footnotes, signatures. "Take this 50-page PDF and break it into structured sections I can query."

**Summarization** condenses long content into key points: "Turn this 30-minute meeting transcript into a 5-bullet summary" or "Give me the key findings from this 200-page research report."

**Structured output generation** transforms free-text into a defined schema: "Take this customer email and extract: issue type, product mentioned, urgency level, and requested action."

### Why Extraction Products Are Different

**Correctness is binary, not subjective.** If the contract value is $1.5 million and your system extracts $15 million, that's not "kind of right" — it's wrong. Unlike text generation where quality is somewhat subjective, extraction products often have objectively correct answers. This makes evaluation simpler in some ways (you can automate accuracy checks) but harder in others (even small errors are obvious and damaging).

**Precision matters more than fluency.** Nobody cares if your entity extraction system writes beautifully. They care if it gets the right entity. A system that extracts "John Smith, CEO, Acme Corp, $2.3M" in ugly formatting is infinitely better than one that writes a beautiful paragraph but misses the dollar amount.

**Schema adherence is a first-class requirement.** When your extraction product feeds data into a downstream system — a database, a dashboard, an API — the output must match the expected schema exactly. Wrong field names, unexpected types, or missing required fields break the pipeline. Production extraction systems need strict output validation.

**Edge cases are everywhere.** Dates can be "January 5, 2026," "01/05/26," "5th Jan '26," or "next Tuesday." Dollar amounts can be "$1.5M," "one and a half million dollars," "USD 1,500,000," or "approximately $1.5 million." Names can be misspelled, abbreviated, or written in different scripts. Your extraction system needs to handle all of these, and the long tail of formats is much longer than you expect.

### Eval Strategy for Extraction

**Exact match for structured fields.** Did the system extract the right value? Compare against ground truth. This is the simplest and most reliable evaluation method — and it's available because extraction tasks usually have objectively correct answers.

**Fuzzy match for text fields.** Names, addresses, and descriptions might have legitimate variations. "John A. Smith" and "John Smith" and "J. Smith" might all be correct extractions. Your eval needs to handle these variants.

**Schema compliance rate.** What percentage of outputs match the expected schema exactly? In production, even 95% schema compliance means 5% of your pipeline outputs are broken.

**Coverage.** What percentage of the target entities were found? Missing an entity is often worse than extracting a wrong one, because missing data is invisible — nobody knows the system failed to find it.

### The Business Case

Extraction products often have the clearest ROI in AI. If a human takes 20 minutes to extract data from an invoice and your system does it in 2 seconds with 97% accuracy, the math is obvious. The key is being honest about that accuracy number and the cost of the 3% errors. If the errors require human review anyway, your actual time savings are 20 minutes minus human review time — not 20 minutes to zero.
