# Chapter 1 — What AI Products Actually Are

Let me be direct with you: most people building AI products in 2026 don't actually understand what they're building.

They've seen the demos. They've watched GPT-4 write poetry, Claude analyze contracts, and Gemini describe images. They've sat in boardrooms where someone said "we need an AI strategy" and everyone nodded. Then they hired engineers, picked a model, and started prompting — without ever defining what their product actually is, who it serves, or how they'll know if it works.

That's how you burn six months and a million dollars on something that never ships.

This chapter is about getting honest before you get technical. We'll cover the gap between what AI looks like in demos and what it takes to run in production. We'll talk about why projects fail — and it's almost never the model. We'll walk through the real decision of whether AI should be your core product or a feature inside something else. And we'll build a framework for knowing when you're actually ready to ship, not just ready to show.

If you're a founder, PM, or engineering lead about to start an AI project, this chapter might save you from the most expensive mistake in tech right now: building something impressive that nobody can actually use.

*Let's start with the uncomfortable truth about demos.*
