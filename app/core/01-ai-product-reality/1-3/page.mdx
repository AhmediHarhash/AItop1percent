# Chapter 1.3 — AI as a Feature vs AI as the Product

This decision shapes everything downstream — your team, your pricing, your risk profile, your evaluation strategy, and how much sleep you lose at night. Yet most teams never explicitly make it. They drift into one mode or the other and don't realize the implications until they're in too deep.

Let me walk you through the difference, because getting this wrong is expensive.

### AI as a Feature

Think of Grammarly's tone suggestions, Notion's AI summarizer, or Shopify's product description generator. The core product exists without AI. The AI adds value on top — it makes the product better, faster, or smarter, but if the AI breaks, the product still works.

This is the safer bet for most teams, and here's why:

- **Lower risk.** If the AI gives a bad suggestion, the user ignores it and keeps working. The core product still functions.
- **Gradual rollout.** You can ship AI to 5% of users, measure impact, and scale up. No big-bang launch required.
- **Simpler evaluation.** You're measuring "did the AI feature improve the user's workflow?" not "did the entire product work at all?"
- **Cost containment.** If AI costs spike, you can throttle the feature without killing the product.

The trap with "AI as a feature" is treating it as an afterthought. Even a feature needs evaluation, monitoring, and a fallback plan. The teams that bolt on AI without thinking about quality end up with a feature that annoys more users than it helps.

### AI as the Product

Think of ChatGPT, Midjourney, Harvey (AI lawyer), or Glean (AI search). Remove the AI and there's nothing left. The model is the product.

This is the higher-risk, higher-reward path:

- **Total dependency.** If the AI fails, your product fails. There's no fallback to a non-AI version.
- **Harder evaluation.** You're not measuring a feature improvement — you're measuring whether the entire experience is good enough to justify paying for.
- **Model risk.** You're dependent on foundation model quality, pricing, and availability. If your provider changes their model, deprecates an endpoint, or raises prices 3x, your product is in trouble.
- **Higher quality bar.** Users tolerate a bad AI feature. They don't tolerate a bad AI product. Your error rate needs to be dramatically lower.

The advantage is differentiation. When AI is the product, your entire user experience is built around the model's capabilities. You can design workflows that aren't possible without AI, and you can build a moat through data, fine-tuning, and domain expertise.

### The Hybrid Trap

Many teams end up in a dangerous middle ground. They build a product where AI is technically a feature, but the product's value proposition depends entirely on that feature. An "AI-powered search tool" where the search is all AI — that's not a feature, that's the product wearing a feature's disguise.

The problem with the hybrid trap is you get the risk profile of "AI as the product" but plan and staff like it's "AI as a feature." You under-invest in evaluation, monitoring, and fallback design because you think it's just a feature. Then it breaks, and your entire product goes down.

Be honest about which category you're in. If removing the AI makes your product useless, it's the product — plan accordingly.

### How to Decide

Ask three questions:

**1. What happens if the AI is unavailable for 24 hours?**
If the answer is "users can still do their core job," it's a feature. If the answer is "the product is dead," it's the product.

**2. What's the error tolerance?**
Features can afford 10-15% error rates because users have the core product to fall back on. Products need error rates under 5% — often under 2% — because there's nowhere else to go.

**3. Who's your buyer?**
Feature buyers are already using your product and want it enhanced. Product buyers are choosing your AI over doing the task themselves or using a non-AI alternative. The sales motion, pricing, and competitive positioning are completely different.

### What This Means for Evaluation

This decision cascades into everything we cover in Section 3 (Evaluation Strategy). If AI is a feature, your eval framework focuses on incremental improvement metrics. If AI is the product, your eval framework is the quality system for the entire business.

Get clear on this before you write a single eval test.
