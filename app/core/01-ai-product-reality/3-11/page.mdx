# Chapter 3.11 — Dynamic Risk: When Your Product Changes Tier Over Time

Here's something most risk frameworks don't tell you: your risk tier isn't fixed. It changes as your product evolves, your user base grows, your capabilities expand, and the regulatory landscape shifts. The product you launched at Tier 1 six months ago might be operating at Tier 3 today without anyone having made a conscious decision to change tiers.

### How Risk Tiers Drift

**Feature creep raises risk.** You launch an internal document search tool (Tier 1). Someone adds a "draft response" feature (still Tier 1). Then someone connects it to the customer email system so it can send those drafts (now Tier 2). Then the legal team starts using it for contract analysis (now Tier 3). Each feature addition seemed small. The cumulative risk shift was massive.

**User behavior raises risk.** You build a general-purpose assistant for employee productivity (Tier 1). Employees start using it to answer customer questions by copying and pasting responses (effectively Tier 2). HR starts asking it questions about employment law (effectively Tier 3). You never intended these use cases, but they're happening.

**Scale raises risk.** An AI system serving 100 internal users has limited blast radius. The same system serving 100,000 external users has a completely different risk profile — not because the technology changed, but because the consequences of failure now affect more people.

**Geography raises risk.** You launch in the US where your use case isn't specifically regulated. You expand to the EU and suddenly the EU AI Act applies. Same product, same technology, different risk tier.

**Regulation raises risk.** Your product was unregulated when you built it. A new regulation takes effect. Your risk tier changes overnight without you changing a single line of code.

### Detecting Risk Drift

Risk drift is dangerous because it's gradual. Nobody sends an email saying "our product just moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3." It happens quietly, and teams only notice when an incident forces them to look.

Build detection mechanisms:

**Quarterly risk review.** Every quarter, your product, engineering, and legal teams sit down and re-evaluate the risk tier. Walk through the five dimensions from Chapter 3.1. Has anything changed? New features, new users, new geographies, new regulations?

**Usage pattern monitoring.** Track how users actually use the product, not just how you intended them to use it. If users are asking your chatbot medical questions and you didn't design it for that, your risk profile is different from what you think.

**Feature flag risk tagging.** When you add a new feature, tag it with its risk impact. "This feature adds tool-use capability" = risk tier increase. "This feature adds customer-facing access" = risk tier increase. Make risk impact a required field in your feature specification process.

**Regulatory tracking.** Assign someone to monitor regulatory developments in your industry and geographies. When a new regulation is proposed, assess whether it affects your product's risk tier. Don't wait for enforcement — by then you're already non-compliant.

### Managing Tier Transitions

When your product's risk tier increases, you need a transition plan:

**1. Acknowledge the change.** The first step is admitting that your product has moved to a higher tier. This is often politically difficult — nobody wants to tell leadership that the product now needs three months of additional evaluation work. But denial is more expensive than acknowledgment.

**2. Gap analysis.** Compare your current evaluation, monitoring, release process, and safety infrastructure to what the new tier requires. Identify every gap.

**3. Prioritize by risk.** Fix the most dangerous gaps first. If you've moved to Tier 3 and you don't have safety testing, that's urgent. If you don't have compliance documentation, that's important but not immediate.

**4. Build the bridge while you walk.** You don't have to stop shipping while you upgrade. Implement interim measures — tighter human review, reduced scope, stricter fallbacks — while you build the permanent infrastructure.

**5. Update the team's expectations.** Moving to a higher risk tier means slower release cycles, more evaluation work, and higher quality bars. Everyone needs to understand and accept this, from leadership to individual contributors.

### When Risk Decreases

Risk can also decrease. An agent product that adds a mandatory human approval step might drop from Tier 3 to Tier 2. A product that exits a regulated market might no longer need Tier 4 compliance.

When risk decreases, resist the urge to immediately dismantle the higher-tier infrastructure. Keep it in a simplified form. It's much easier to scale up evaluation depth than to rebuild it from scratch if you ever need to move back up.

*Next: data residency and cross-border compliance — the enterprise reality of Tier 4.*
