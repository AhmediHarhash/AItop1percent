# Chapter 4.8 — Communication Patterns That Prevent AI Product Failures

Most AI product failures aren't technical. They're communication failures disguised as technical failures. The model worked fine — but the PM didn't know the eval set was stale. The eval set was comprehensive — but engineering didn't know the quality had degraded. The quality degradation was detected — but nobody told the stakeholders until a customer complained.

Let me walk you through the communication patterns that prevent these scenarios.

### Pattern 1: The Weekly Quality Sync

**What it is:** A 30-minute weekly meeting where the AI engineer, PM, and eval owner review quality metrics from the past week.

**What you review:**
- Current quality scores vs thresholds
- Any regressions or anomalies
- Top failure modes from the past week (specific examples)
- Upcoming changes that might affect quality (model updates, prompt changes, new features)
- Status of the eval set (is it still representative? any gaps discovered?)

**Why it works:** Quality problems caught in a weekly sync are one-week-old problems. Quality problems caught when a customer complains are one-month-old problems. The weekly cadence creates a drumbeat of quality awareness that prevents drift.

**The rule:** This meeting never gets canceled. If quality is fine, the meeting takes 10 minutes. If quality is degrading, the meeting takes the full 30 and produces action items.

### Pattern 2: The Pre-Ship Checklist Communication

**What it is:** Before any significant change ships (model update, major prompt change, new feature), the person making the change shares a structured pre-ship summary with the team.

**The summary includes:**
- What's changing and why
- Eval results: before and after
- Any regressions (even small ones)
- Risk assessment: what could go wrong
- Rollback plan: how to undo this if it fails

**Why it works:** It forces the person making the change to think through the implications before shipping. And it gives everyone else the information they need to make a ship/no-ship decision without having to dig through dashboards.

### Pattern 3: The Incident Postmortem

**What it is:** After any quality incident (quality dropped below threshold, user-reported issue, safety violation), the team runs a structured postmortem.

**The postmortem answers:**
- What happened? (Timeline and facts)
- Why did it happen? (Root cause analysis)
- Why didn't we catch it sooner? (Detection gap)
- What are we changing to prevent recurrence? (Action items)

**Why it works:** Postmortems convert incidents into improvements. Without them, you make the same mistakes repeatedly. With them, every incident makes your system stronger.

**The rule:** Blame-free. The postmortem is about the system, not the person. If someone shipped a bad change, the question isn't "why did they do that?" — it's "why did our process allow that?"

### Pattern 4: Stakeholder Quality Reports

**What it is:** A monthly report to leadership and stakeholders that summarizes AI product quality in business terms.

**The report includes:**
- Quality metrics trend (are we improving, stable, or declining?)
- User satisfaction signals (NPS, CSAT, support ticket volume)
- Cost metrics (cost per query, total AI spend, cost per resolved task)
- Top issues and what we're doing about them
- Upcoming changes and expected impact

**Why it works:** Stakeholders who receive regular, honest updates are patient and supportive. Stakeholders who only hear about AI quality when something breaks are anxious and reactive. Regular reporting builds trust and sets realistic expectations.

### Pattern 5: The Cross-Functional Slack Channel

**What it is:** A dedicated channel where AI quality signals, alerts, incidents, and observations are shared in real time. Everyone on the AI product team is in the channel.

**What goes in it:**
- Automated alerts when quality metrics cross thresholds
- Interesting failure examples from production
- User feedback highlights
- Eval results from CI/CD runs
- Questions and observations from any team member

**Why it works:** It creates ambient awareness. The PM sees the same quality signals the engineer sees. The domain expert sees the failure examples. Everyone develops an intuition for how the product is performing, without requiring formal meetings for every observation.

### The Meta-Pattern

All five patterns share a principle: **make quality visible and make it everyone's concern.** AI quality isn't a metric that lives in a dashboard nobody checks. It's a living, shared understanding of how the product is performing, where it's struggling, and what's being done about it.

Teams with strong quality communication ship more confidently, catch problems faster, and build better products. Teams without it are always surprised — and surprises in AI are almost never pleasant.
