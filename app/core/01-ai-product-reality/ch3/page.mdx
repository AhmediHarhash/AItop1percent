# Chapter 3 — Risk Tiers & Why They Matter

Here's something that will save you from a career-defining mistake: not all AI products carry the same risk.

An internal tool that suggests meeting titles is not the same as a medical AI that recommends drug dosages. Yet many teams apply the same development rigor to both — either over-engineering the low-risk product (wasting months) or under-engineering the high-risk one (inviting disaster).

Risk tiers are the framework that tells you how much rigor your product actually needs. They determine your evaluation strategy, your release process, your monitoring depth, your compliance requirements, and your team structure. Get the tier wrong, and everything downstream is miscalibrated.

This chapter walks through the four risk tiers, how to classify your product, and what each tier demands — including the AI-specific risks that traditional software frameworks miss entirely.

## What This Chapter Covers

- **3.1** — What risk means in AI (five dimensions)
- **3.2** — Tier 1: Low-risk (internal tools, drafts)
- **3.3** — Tier 2: Medium-risk (customer-facing, non-critical)
- **3.4** — Tier 3: High-risk (financial, medical, legal decisions)
- **3.5** — Tier 4: Regulated (EU AI Act, HIPAA, SOX, FDA)
- **3.6** — Risk by outcome vs risk by action (agents and the OWASP Agentic Top 10)
- **3.7** — How risk tier dictates eval strategy
- **3.8** — How risk tier dictates release process
- **3.9** — How risk tier dictates monitoring depth
- **3.10** — Risk tier misclassification mistakes
- **3.11** — Dynamic risk (when your tier changes over time)
- **3.12** — Data residency and cross-border risk
- **3.13** — GPAI model obligations under the EU AI Act

Misclassifying your risk tier is one of the most expensive mistakes in AI product development. This chapter makes sure you don't make it.

*Let's start with what risk actually means when AI is involved.*
