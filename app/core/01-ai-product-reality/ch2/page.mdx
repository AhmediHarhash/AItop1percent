# Chapter 2 — AI Product Categories & Archetypes

Not all AI products are the same, and the differences matter more than most teams realize.

A chatbot and a document extraction pipeline are both "AI products," but they have completely different architectures, evaluation strategies, failure modes, and user expectations. The team that treats them the same will build the wrong infrastructure, measure the wrong metrics, and miss the wrong risks.

This chapter walks through the nine major AI product archetypes you'll encounter in 2026. For each one, we'll cover what makes it unique, what makes it hard, and what you need to know before you build. By the end, you'll be able to classify any AI product — and understand why that classification drives every decision that follows.

## What This Chapter Covers

- **2.1** — Text generation products (chatbots, copilots, writers)
- **2.2** — Classification and decision products
- **2.3** — Search and retrieval products (RAG, semantic search)
- **2.4** — Extraction and structuring products
- **2.5** — Agent products (autonomous workflows, tool-using AI)
- **2.6** — Voice and conversational products
- **2.7** — Vision and multimodal products
- **2.8** — Code generation and developer tools
- **2.9** — Hybrid products (multiple archetypes combined)

Every product you build will be one of these — or a combination. Knowing which archetype you're building is the first step to building it right.

*Let's start with the most common archetype: text generation.*
