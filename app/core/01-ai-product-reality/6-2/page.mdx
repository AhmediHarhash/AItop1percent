# Chapter 6.2 — Commoditization: When Your Moat Disappears Overnight

Here's a story that played out dozens of times between 2023 and 2025. A startup builds an AI product — say, an email writer. They get traction. They raise funding. Then OpenAI adds the same feature to ChatGPT. Or Google builds it into Gmail. Or Microsoft puts it in Outlook. Overnight, the startup's entire product becomes a free feature inside a platform that already has a billion users.

This is commoditization. And in AI, it happens faster than in any previous technology cycle.

### Why AI Commoditizes So Fast

**The foundation layer is shared.** Unlike traditional software, where you build your own algorithms, AI products largely run on the same foundation models. When everyone uses GPT-4 or Claude or Llama, the model isn't a differentiator — it's a commodity input. Your product's uniqueness has to come from somewhere else.

**New model releases reset the playing field.** You spend six months fine-tuning a model to be great at medical summarization. Then a new foundation model releases that's better at medical summarization out of the box. Your six months of work is now worth less. This happens regularly — model capabilities improve in jumps, not gradual slopes.

**Features are easy to replicate.** "We built an AI that summarizes documents" is a feature, not a moat. Any team with API access can build the same thing in a week. If your entire product is one AI capability with a UI on top, you're one API update away from irrelevance.

### What Doesn't Commoditize

**Proprietary data.** If you have data nobody else has — customer-specific data, industry-specific datasets, proprietary knowledge bases — that's a moat. The model is the engine, but data is the fuel. Better fuel produces better outputs, regardless of the engine.

**Workflow integration.** Being deeply embedded in a customer's workflow creates switching costs. If your AI is woven into their Salesforce pipeline, their approval process, and their reporting dashboards, they can't replace you by switching to a different AI tool. Integration is stickier than capability.

**Domain expertise encoded in the product.** Not just "we fine-tuned the model," but "we built evaluation frameworks, edge case handling, fallback logic, and domain-specific guardrails that took 18 months to develop." The product intelligence that surrounds the model is harder to replicate than the model call itself.

**Trust and compliance.** In regulated industries, being trusted and compliant is a moat. If a hospital has validated your AI through their clinical review process, they're not switching to a competitor just because the competitor has a slightly better model. The validation process itself creates lock-in.

**Network effects and data flywheels.** Every user interaction makes your product smarter. More users generate more data, which improves your evaluations, which improves your product, which attracts more users. This is the strongest moat in AI — but it takes time and volume to build.

### The Commoditization Test

Before you build, ask: "If a well-funded competitor decided to build exactly this product tomorrow, how long would it take them to match us?"

- **Less than 3 months:** You don't have a moat. Rethink your strategy.
- **3-12 months:** You have a head start, not a moat. Move fast and build defensibility.
- **More than 12 months:** You have something defensible. Invest in it.

The honest answer is usually less time than you think. That's not a reason not to build — it's a reason to build the right things.
