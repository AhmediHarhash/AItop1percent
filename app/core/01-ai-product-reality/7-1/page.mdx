# Chapter 7.1 — The First 48 Hours: From Idea to Working Prototype

You have an idea for an AI product. Maybe it's from a customer conversation, a market gap, or a problem you've experienced yourself. The distance between that idea and a working prototype is shorter than you think — if you start in the right place.

Most teams start by designing the architecture, debating the tech stack, or writing a PRD. Don't. Start by making the AI do the thing. In 48 hours, you should have a working prototype that answers the most important question: can an AI actually do this task well enough to be useful?

### The 48-Hour Prototype

**Hour 0-2: Define one task.** Not your full product vision. One specific task. "Summarize a customer support ticket and suggest a response." "Extract the key terms from a legal contract." "Answer a product question using our documentation." Pick the single task that represents the core value of your product.

**Hour 2-6: Build the simplest possible version.** Open a playground (Claude, ChatGPT, or any model provider's interface). Write a system prompt. Feed it real examples of the task. See what happens. No code. No infrastructure. Just a human talking to a model and evaluating the outputs.

**Hour 6-12: Try 20 real examples.** Not toy examples you made up — real inputs from your actual use case. Customer support tickets from your ticketing system. Real contracts. Real product questions. Run 20 of them through your prompt. For each one, rate the output: good, acceptable, or bad.

**Hour 12-24: Iterate on the prompt.** The first results will be mixed. Some outputs will be surprisingly good. Others will be clearly wrong. Improve the prompt based on the failure patterns you see. Add examples. Add constraints. Clarify instructions. Re-run your 20 examples.

**Hour 24-48: Build a minimal interface.** A simple script, a Streamlit app, or a basic web form. Something that lets you (or a colleague, or a potential user) try the AI on new inputs without touching the prompt. This isn't a product — it's a test harness that lets you collect more feedback faster.

### What You're Looking For

After 48 hours, you should know:

**Can the AI do this task at all?** If the best available model can't produce acceptable outputs on your task with good prompting, no amount of engineering will fix it. Some tasks are beyond current AI capability. Better to discover this in 48 hours than 6 months.

**What's the baseline quality?** Of your 20 examples, how many were good, acceptable, or bad? This is your day-zero baseline. Everything you build from here should improve on this number.

**What are the failure patterns?** Where does the AI fail? Does it hallucinate specific types of facts? Does it miss nuances that a domain expert would catch? Does it follow instructions inconsistently? These failure patterns tell you what your eval framework needs to measure and what your product needs to handle.

**Is this worth building?** If the prototype is already useful — imperfect but genuinely helpful — you have something. If it's consistently wrong or unhelpful despite your best prompting efforts, you either need a different approach or a different product idea.

### The Prototype Trap

One warning: don't fall in love with the prototype. A prototype that works on 20 examples might fail on 200. A prompt that works in a playground might break in production. The purpose of the 48-hour prototype is to decide whether to invest further — not to declare victory.

The prototype gives you a green light or a red light. Green means: proceed to evaluation. Red means: pivot, adjust, or abandon.
