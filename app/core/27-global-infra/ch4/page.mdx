# Chapter 4 — Networking, Storage, and the Data Plane

The orchestration layer schedules your workloads. The data plane moves bytes between them. And in AI infrastructure, the data plane is where physics becomes your primary constraint. Web applications move kilobytes per request. AI training moves terabytes per hour between GPUs that must stay synchronized within microseconds. AI inference serves model weights that are tens of gigabytes each, loading them into GPU memory before a single token can be generated. The network fabric, the storage tier, and the interconnect topology underneath your Kubernetes cluster determine the ceiling for everything above it. No amount of clever scheduling compensates for a bandwidth bottleneck between GPU nodes. No autoscaling policy fixes a storage system that cannot deliver model weights fast enough to meet cold-start targets.

This chapter covers the physical and logical fabric that AI workloads depend on. You will learn why InfiniBand and RDMA dominate training networks while Ethernet struggles, how NVLink topology shapes multi-GPU communication, why NCCL collective operations fail silently at scale, and what high-performance storage actually means for model checkpointing and dataset streaming. You will also confront the problems that most teams discover too late: multi-gigabyte container images that blow up pull times, cold-start stampedes that overwhelm artifact registries, and the data gravity principle that reshapes where inference must happen. The network and storage layer is not glamorous infrastructure. It is the foundation that determines whether your AI platform performs or chokes.

*When you understand the data plane, you stop blaming the orchestrator for problems that live in the network, the storage tier, and the physics of moving large artifacts across a planet.*
