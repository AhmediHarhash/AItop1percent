# Chapter 5 — Multi-Region Architecture for AI Systems

Running AI in a single region is a bet that nothing will go wrong in that region and that every user on the planet will tolerate the latency. It is also a bet that no regulator in any market you serve will ever require data to stay within national borders. In 2026, all three of those bets are losing bets. Cloud providers experience regional outages multiple times per year. Users in Tokyo notice the 180 milliseconds to Virginia. The EU AI Act, combined with GDPR data residency requirements and emerging sovereign AI mandates in India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia, means that a single-region deployment increasingly limits where you can legally operate. Multi-region is not an optimization. It is a prerequisite for production AI at global scale.

But multi-region AI is categorically harder than multi-region web. A typical web application replicates a database and deploys stateless containers. AI systems replicate model weights measured in tens of gigabytes, maintain inference state that does not survive failover cleanly, and depend on GPU capacity that varies dramatically by region and provider. Some regions have thousands of available H100 GPUs. Others have a six-month waitlist. Traffic steering cannot simply route to the nearest healthy endpoint when the nearest healthy endpoint lacks the GPU capacity to serve the request. Every architectural decision in multi-region AI touches cost, latency, compliance, and capacity simultaneously, and optimizing for one often degrades another.

This chapter covers how to design AI systems that span multiple regions without breaking the budget or the physics. You will learn how to replicate model weights efficiently, synchronize model versions across regions, steer traffic based on latency and capacity and compliance constraints together, and plan regional capacity in a world where GPU supply changes quarterly.
