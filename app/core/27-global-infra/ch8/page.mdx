# Chapter 8 — Training Infrastructure and Job Management

Training infrastructure operates under a fundamentally different contract than inference infrastructure. Inference needs low latency for millions of short requests. Training needs sustained throughput for a single massive job that runs for hours, days, or weeks -- consuming entire GPU nodes, saturating high-bandwidth interconnects, and accumulating costs that reach thousands of dollars per run. When a training job fails at hour eleven of a twelve-hour run because nobody configured proper checkpointing, the money is gone and the only deliverable is a restart. When three teams submit competing jobs to the same cluster and the scheduler has no fair-share policy, the result is not just wasted compute but organizational conflict that slows everyone down. Training infrastructure is where GPU scarcity, distributed systems complexity, and team coordination collide.

This chapter covers the infrastructure you need to train and fine-tune models reliably at scale: cluster architecture and interconnect design, distributed training frameworks like FSDP and DeepSpeed, job scheduling and resource allocation, checkpointing strategies that survive hardware failures, experiment tracking that scales beyond a single researcher, continuous fine-tuning pipelines, and the critical handoff that moves a trained model into production serving without manual intervention or silent regression.

*A cluster that can train models is only as valuable as the operational practices around it. The next chapter turns from building the platform to operating it -- the observability, cost attribution, on-call practices, and maturity model that determine whether your AI infrastructure is a shared experiment or a production-grade internal product.*
