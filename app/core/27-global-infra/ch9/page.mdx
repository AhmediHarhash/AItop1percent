# Chapter 9 — Observability, Operations, and Platform Maturity

Building the AI platform is the part that gets funded. Operating it -- day after day, incident after incident, upgrade after upgrade -- is the part that determines whether the investment pays off. GPU metrics behave differently from CPU metrics, and the dashboards your infrastructure team built for traditional services miss the signals that matter most for AI workloads. Distributed tracing for AI pipelines crosses more service boundaries than conventional microservices, passing through model servers, vector databases, orchestration layers, and guardrail services in a single request. Power and cooling constraints that never mattered for CPU-based infrastructure become hard capacity limits when you fill racks with high-wattage accelerators. Cost attribution to teams and projects requires FinOps discipline that most organizations have not yet developed for AI spend. And the platform itself must evolve from a shared cluster that a few ML engineers maintain into an internal product with SLOs, self-serve portals, golden paths, and the kind of operational rigor that earns trust from the rest of the organization.

This chapter covers what it takes to run the platform, not just build it. You will learn the observability patterns that catch silent degradation before users do, the GPU-specific metrics that predict failures and waste, the FinOps practices that make AI spend accountable, the on-call structures that work for AI infrastructure, and the maturity model that tells you where your platform sits today and what to build next.

*Every platform starts as an experiment. The ones that survive become products -- internal products with real users, real SLOs, and real operational accountability. This chapter gives you the map from where you are to where the platform needs to be.*
