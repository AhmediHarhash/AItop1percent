# Section 27 — Global Infrastructure and Kubernetes at Scale

Every AI system runs on infrastructure. The question is whether that infrastructure was designed for AI or merely inherited from the web application era.

Most organizations start the same way. They provision a few GPU instances, deploy a model behind an API, and call it production. It works for the first team. Then the second team arrives, and the third, and suddenly the company is running twelve different GPU clusters with no shared scheduling, no cost visibility, and no way to failover when a region goes down. The infrastructure that worked for one model collapses under the weight of a platform.

This section is for the people who build and operate that platform. Not the application team choosing models and writing prompts — that is Section 19. This is for the infrastructure team: the platform engineers, the SREs, the Kubernetes operators, the capacity planners, the people responsible for making sure that when a product team says "I need four A100s for inference," those GPUs are available, networked, monitored, and cost-attributed within minutes instead of weeks.

We cover the full stack: Kubernetes for AI workloads, GPU scheduling and device management, multi-tenancy and governance, high-performance networking and storage, multi-region architecture, multi-cloud strategy, edge deployment, training infrastructure, and the operational practices that keep it all running. The perspective throughout is that of a principal SRE designing for multi-region, multi-cloud operations from day one — because retrofitting global infrastructure is ten times harder than building it right the first time.

*The infrastructure you build determines what every other team can ship. Get it right, and the entire organization moves faster. Get it wrong, and every AI project becomes an infrastructure project first.*
