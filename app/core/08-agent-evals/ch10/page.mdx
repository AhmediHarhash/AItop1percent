# Chapter 10 — Agent Deployment, Scaling, and Cost Management

Deploying an agent is not the same as deploying a REST API. Agents are stateful, long-running, and resource-intensive. They can spin out of control, burn through budgets, and create operational chaos if you treat them like traditional services.

Production agent systems need deployment patterns that support gradual rollouts, cost controls that prevent runaway spending, and scaling strategies that handle bursts without breaking the bank. They need session management for long-running tasks, queue management for high concurrency, and resume-replay-cancel logic for fault tolerance.

This chapter covers the infrastructure, operational, and financial concerns of running agents at scale: from canary deployments to cost anomaly detection, from step budgets to acceptance tests. You'll learn how to deploy safely, scale efficiently, and keep costs predictable as agent usage grows.
