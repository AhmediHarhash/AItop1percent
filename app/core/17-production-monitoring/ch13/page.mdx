# Chapter 13 — Observability Tooling and Platform Selection

The AI observability market in 2026 is fragmented and fast-moving. Gateway-based tools like Helicone and Portkey sit between your application and model providers, capturing telemetry with zero code changes. Platform tools like Langfuse, LangSmith, and Arize Phoenix provide end-to-end tracing with native support for prompts, chains, and agents. Enterprise APM vendors like Datadog and New Relic have added AI-specific capabilities to their existing platforms. Choosing between these options requires understanding your constraints — privacy requirements, multi-provider support, self-hosting needs, and integration complexity. The wrong choice locks you into a tool that does not scale with your system.

*The best observability tool is the one your team will actually use. Features on paper mean nothing if the integration is too painful to complete.*
