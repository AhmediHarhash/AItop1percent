# Chapter 1 — Why AI Observability Is Different

Traditional monitoring tells you when your service is down. AI observability tells you when your service is wrong. That distinction shapes everything about how you build, operate, and trust production AI systems. The techniques you learned for monitoring web applications, databases, and APIs will not save you when your model starts hallucinating at 3am. The dashboards that tell you latency is low and error rates are zero will stay green while your system confidently gives users incorrect advice. AI observability is a fundamentally different discipline because AI failure modes are fundamentally different — silent, gradual, and invisible to infrastructure metrics.

*The team that invests in AI observability early is the team that sleeps through the night. Everyone else gets paged for problems they could have seen coming.*
