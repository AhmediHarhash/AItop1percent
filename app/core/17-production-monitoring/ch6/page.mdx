# Chapter 6 — Agent and Multi-Step System Observability

Agents are not API calls. They are autonomous processes that plan, execute, and adapt across multiple steps, often calling external tools with real-world consequences. Observing agents requires tracking not just individual responses but entire trajectories — the sequence of decisions, the tools invoked, the reasoning at each step, and the cumulative cost and latency of the full execution. Agent failures compound. A bad decision at step three propagates through steps four through twelve. A tool call that hangs blocks the entire execution. A loop that never terminates burns budget until someone notices. Agent observability is fundamentally about trajectory monitoring, not request monitoring.

*A single agent request can execute twenty tool calls, make fifty API round trips, and spend more than a human operator costs per hour. You need to see every step.*
