# Chapter 11 — Cost Monitoring and Optimization

AI costs are variable in ways that traditional software costs are not. A single user with long context windows can consume more budget than a hundred users with short queries. An agent loop that spins can burn through your monthly allocation in hours. A prompt change that increases verbosity by twenty percent increases costs by twenty percent. Cost monitoring is not a finance function — it is an operational function that belongs in your observability stack alongside latency and quality. Real-time cost tracking, budget alerts, anomaly detection, and token waste analysis are not nice-to-haves. They are the infrastructure that prevents a successful product from becoming an unprofitable one.

*You cannot optimize what you do not measure. Teams without cost observability discover their margins in monthly invoices. Teams with it discover them in daily dashboards.*
