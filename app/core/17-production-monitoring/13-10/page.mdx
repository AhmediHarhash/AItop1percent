# 13.10 — Evaluating Observability Tools: The Questions to Ask Before Committing

Start with realistic test data. The marketing agency evaluated observability tools by sending ten test requests through each platform and comparing dashboards. They chose the tool with the prettiest interface. In production, they discovered the tool could not handle their actual request volumes, charged ten times more than projected, and lacked features they needed. The evaluation had tested nothing that mattered.

Tool evaluation requires testing the specific scenarios your production system will encounter. Not hypothetical best-case usage. Not vendor demos with curated data. Your actual workload at your actual scale with your actual requirements. The only way to discover whether a tool works for you is testing it under conditions that approximate production reality.

## The Load Testing Question

How does the tool perform at your expected scale? The e-commerce company processed five million AI requests daily with spikes to eight million during promotions. They needed observability that handled peak load without degrading. During evaluation, they sent one million synthetic traces through each candidate tool over a twelve-hour period. Two tools became unusably slow. One tool started dropping traces silently. One tool handled the load without issues. That single test eliminated three options definitively.

Load testing reveals whether pricing scales reasonably. Per-event pricing that seems cheap at small volumes can become prohibitively expensive at scale. The education platform sent their projected monthly volume through each tool during trials. They discovered one vendor would charge twenty-three thousand dollars monthly at scale despite claiming competitive pricing. Another vendor would charge four thousand dollars for the same volume. The pricing difference was invisible until they tested at realistic scale.

Load testing also reveals operational issues. Does the tool slow down with large trace volumes? Do queries timeout? Does the UI become unusable? Do exports fail? The financial services company discovered during load testing that their chosen tool's search feature stopped working with more than ten million traces. Their production system would exceed that in two months. They found a disqualifying limitation before signing a contract.

## The Data Privacy and Compliance Question

Where does your data go and who can access it? The healthcare company needed written documentation that their observability vendor would never store protected health information in US data centers and that no vendor employee could access trace data without explicit authorization. Most vendors could not provide those guarantees. The few that could became the only viable options regardless of other features.

Ask for specific architectural details. Where physically are data centers located? What encryption is used in transit and at rest? Who has database access? What happens to data during support tickets? Can vendor engineers see your prompts? The insurance company asked these questions to every vendor. The answers varied dramatically and several vendors admitted they had not considered some scenarios. The depth of answers revealed maturity and trustworthiness.

Request compliance certifications relevant to your industry. SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA compliance, GDPR adequacy, ISO 27001. Do not accept vague claims of compliance. Request actual audit reports and certifications. The fintech company eliminated vendors who could not provide recent SOC 2 reports. Compliance is not negotiable. Tools that do not take it seriously are not enterprise-ready.

## The Integration Question

Does the tool work with your existing systems? The logistics company used Slack for alerts, PagerDuty for incident management, Snowflake for data warehousing, and Tableau for reporting. They needed observability tools that integrated with all four. During evaluation, they tested each integration specifically. Two tools claimed Slack integration but only supported basic webhook notifications, not rich formatting or threading. One tool claimed PagerDuty integration but it was unreliable and dropped alerts occasionally. Testing revealed that marketing claims did not match implementation quality.

Integration testing should include failure scenarios. What happens when the integration endpoint is temporarily down? Does the observability tool queue data or drop it? Does it retry? Does it alert you that integration is failing? The media company tested integration resilience by deliberately breaking connections. One tool silently dropped data when webhooks failed. Another tool queued data and retried with exponential backoff. The difference was critical for production reliability.

Test data export capabilities thoroughly. Can you export raw trace data? What format does it use? How often can you export? Are there rate limits? The research platform needed daily exports to their data lake. During evaluation, they discovered one vendor limited exports to weekly and charged extra for more frequent access. The restriction would have prevented their entire analytics workflow. They discovered it during trial, not after signing.

## The Multi-Provider Support Question

Send traffic to different model providers during evaluation. The content generation company used GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 in production. They sent test requests to all three through each observability tool. One tool calculated costs incorrectly for Anthropic. One tool could not distinguish between different Google models. One tool worked flawlessly with all providers. Testing revealed provider support quality that documentation did not specify clearly.

Check how the tool handles provider API changes. Providers update APIs regularly. Ask vendors how quickly they adapt to changes. The social media company asked each vendor what happened when Claude Opus 4.5 released with new API fields. Two vendors admitted they were still catching up weeks later. One vendor had shipped support within days. The response indicated engineering velocity and commitment to staying current.

## The Query and Analysis Question

Build the dashboards you actually need during evaluation. The travel company created five critical dashboard views they knew they would need in production. Booking funnel with AI assist rates. Model latency by endpoint and region. Cost per booking by model. Quality scores over time. Error rates by type and model. They tried building each dashboard in every tool during trials.

Two tools made some dashboards impossible to build without exporting data externally. One tool had all the necessary features but query performance was unusably slow for their data volumes. One tool let them build everything they needed with good performance. The dashboard building exercise revealed usability and capability gaps that feature lists did not show.

Test complex queries that cross multiple dimensions. The insurance company needed to analyze claims processing accuracy by claim type, model version, time of day, and processor experience level. This required joining trace data with business context and filtering across multiple dimensions. Most tools struggled with the query complexity. One tool handled it naturally. The ability to answer complex questions was a deciding factor.

## The Cost Transparency Question

Understand exactly what you will pay. Get pricing in writing with specific volume tiers and overage rates. The marketing agency was quoted five thousand dollars monthly by a vendor. They asked for a detailed breakdown. The quote included only basic features. The features they actually needed cost an additional eight thousand dollars monthly. The true cost was two point six times the initial quote.

Model your costs at different scale points. What will you pay at current volume? At two times volume? At ten times volume? The SaaS company modeled costs for one, five, and twenty million traces monthly. One vendor's pricing grew linearly and stayed affordable. Another vendor's pricing curve became exponential at high volumes. Knowing this before signing let them choose a vendor whose economics aligned with their growth plans.

Ask about hidden costs. Are there charges for API calls? Data export fees? Support costs? Premium feature charges? The e-commerce company discovered during contract review that their chosen vendor charged separately for team collaboration features that they assumed were included. The additional cost was small but the lack of transparency was concerning. Hidden costs indicate vendors who will continue finding ways to extract more money.

## The Support and Reliability Question

Test support responsiveness during trials. Open support tickets with real questions. Time how long responses take. Evaluate response quality. The financial services company opened tickets with each vendor asking technical questions about data retention policies and API rate limits. Response times varied from one hour to three days. Response quality ranged from detailed technical answers to generic marketing replies. The exercise revealed which vendors had strong support teams.

Ask about SLA commitments. What uptime guarantees does the vendor provide? What happens when they miss SLA? Do they offer credits or refunds? The healthcare company required ninety-nine point nine percent uptime guarantees with financial penalties for failures. Most vendors offered no SLA. The few that did became the only options under consideration.

Check vendor stability and funding. The observability tool market is young. Not all vendors will survive. The logistics company researched each vendor's funding status, revenue, and customer base. They eliminated early-stage startups with uncertain futures. The risk of vendor failure disrupting their operations was unacceptable. They chose established vendors even when newer tools had better features.

## The Customization and Extension Question

Can you modify the tool's behavior for your specific needs? The legal tech company needed custom PII redaction before traces were stored. They needed to add case numbers as metadata to every trace automatically. They needed custom alert logic based on jurisdiction-specific thresholds. Most tools could not support these requirements. One tool offered extensive API and webhook capabilities that let them build custom workflows. The extensibility was essential for their use case.

Test whether the tool can grow with your evolving needs. The media company knew their requirements would change as they learned more about AI operations. They evaluated whether tools provided flexibility to add new metrics, create custom visualizations, and integrate with future tools. Tools that locked them into rigid workflows were eliminated. Tools that provided building blocks they could compose were preferred.

## The Migration and Exit Question

Ask about data export and migration paths. If you decide to leave, how do you get your data out? What format does it use? Are there export limits? The insurance company asked every vendor for specific data export documentation. Most vendors provided vague answers. One vendor had detailed export documentation and API support. The transparency indicated a vendor confident enough to make leaving easy.

Test actual data export during trials. Export sample data and verify you can import it into alternative tools or your own systems. The travel company exported traces from each tool during evaluation and tried importing them into their data warehouse. Two tools provided exports but in formats that required significant transformation. One tool exported clean JSON that loaded directly. The export quality test revealed operational maturity.

## The Real World Testing Protocol

The evaluation framework that works reliably includes five phases. First, eliminate tools that do not meet hard requirements. Compliance, data residency, pricing constraints, required integrations. Second, send realistic test loads to remaining tools. Third, build your critical dashboards and queries in each tool. Fourth, test integration with your specific systems. Fifth, evaluate vendor stability, support quality, and exit paths.

The document processing company followed this framework and evaluated six tools over four weeks. They eliminated two immediately due to compliance issues. They load tested the remaining four and eliminated one that could not handle scale. They built dashboards in the remaining three and found one had better query performance. They tested integrations deeply with the final two and chose the one with more reliable webhook delivery.

The evaluation required significant time but prevented a wrong decision that would have cost far more. The investment in thorough evaluation is always cheaper than the cost of migrating away from a bad choice later. The question is not whether evaluation takes time but whether you can afford to skip it. Most teams cannot.

The tool landscape will evolve. The best tool today may not be the best tool in two years. Regular reevaluation keeps your observability architecture aligned with your needs as both your system and available tools change. But reevaluation should be deliberate, not reactive. You choose when to reconsider tools, not vendors or market conditions. That control comes from preserving optionality through portable architecture and continuous data ownership. With comprehensive understanding of tool selection, integration, and migration strategies, teams can build observability that grows with their systems and preserves flexibility as the landscape evolves.
