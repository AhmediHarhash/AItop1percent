# Chapter 9 — Reliability Engineering for AI Systems

Reliability engineering brings the rigor of SRE practices to AI systems — SLOs that define acceptable quality levels, error budgets that quantify how much degradation you can tolerate, failover strategies that maintain service when primary systems fail, and capacity planning that prevents overload before it happens. AI reliability differs from traditional reliability because quality is a first-class dimension alongside availability and latency. An AI system that returns fast, correct responses 99.9 percent of the time and confidently wrong responses 0.1 percent of the time might have excellent traditional reliability metrics while causing real harm. AI SLOs must account for quality, safety, and cost — not just uptime.

*An AI system with 99.99 percent uptime and 95 percent quality is not a reliable system. It is a liability that happens to stay online.*
