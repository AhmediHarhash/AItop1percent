# Chapter 10 — Model Rollout and Experiment Observability

Most AI failures happen during rollout. You update a prompt, switch models, or deploy a fine-tuned version — and something breaks that worked before. Rollout observability is how you catch these regressions before they affect all users. Shadow mode lets you test changes in production without risk by running new versions alongside current versions and comparing outputs. Canary releases expose changes to a small percentage of traffic first. A/B testing quantifies the impact of changes with statistical rigor. Feature flags give you instant rollback capability when something goes wrong. The observability infrastructure for rollouts is not optional — it is what makes confident iteration possible.

*The team that deploys without shadow testing is the team that discovers regressions in production complaints. The team that deploys with shadow testing discovers them in dashboards.*
