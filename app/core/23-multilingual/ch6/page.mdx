# Chapter 6 — Multilingual RAG and Retrieval

In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation, the query language, the corpus language, the embedding model's strongest language, and the desired output language may all differ — and each mismatch is a silent failure point. A user searching in Japanese across an English knowledge base with a multilingual embedding model expects answers in Japanese, but the retrieval layer may rank English-adjacent results higher, the chunking strategy may split CJK text at the wrong boundaries, and the generation step may drift into the wrong language mid-response. Cross-lingual embedding models like BGE-M3, Qwen3-Embedding, and Cohere Multilingual have made multilingual retrieval tractable in 2026, but the architecture decisions — one unified index versus language-partitioned indexes, chunking strategies that respect script boundaries, reranking models calibrated across languages — determine whether the system actually works or merely appears to.
