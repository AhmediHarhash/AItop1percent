# Chapter 10 — Code-Switching, Dialects, and Language Variation

Code-switching is not an edge case — it is the default mode of communication in most multilingual markets. When a user in India writes half a sentence in Hindi and half in English, or a user in Morocco mixes Darija with French, they are not confused. They are communicating naturally, the way hundreds of millions of people communicate every day. Models, embeddings, RAG systems, and evaluation pipelines all break under mixed-language input, and most teams never test for it because their test sets are written in clean, standard, single-language text that no real user actually produces.

*The gap between the language your model was tested on and the language your users actually speak is where quality goes to die.*
