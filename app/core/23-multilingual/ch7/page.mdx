# Chapter 7 — Multilingual Prompt Engineering and System Design

English prompts fail silently in other languages. Instruction following, formatting compliance, safety constraints, and even basic task completion all degrade differently depending on the language — and the degradation is rarely uniform or predictable. Most production systems are designed with a single implicit assumption: the system prompt is in English, the user speaks English, and the output is in English. The moment any of those three diverge, a three-way mismatch emerges between the system prompt language, the user's input language, and the desired output language. Teams that ignore this mismatch until production discover that their carefully tuned prompts produce inconsistent tone in German, broken formatting in Arabic, and ignored safety constraints in low-resource languages where the model has weaker instruction-following capability.
