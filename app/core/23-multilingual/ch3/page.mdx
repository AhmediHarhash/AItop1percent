# Chapter 3 — The Token Tax: Tokenization, Scripts, and Encoding Robustness

Every major tokenizer in production today was built for English first. The consequence is a hidden tax: the same sentence costs two to five times more tokens in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Thai, or Hindi than it does in English. That multiplier hits your budget, your latency, and your context window simultaneously. A prompt that fits comfortably within eight thousand tokens in English overflows at four thousand in Japanese, starving the model of the context it needs to produce a coherent answer. Worse, encoding failures in Unicode normalization, homoglyph characters, and zero-width joiners create invisible bugs that corrupt multilingual pipelines without triggering a single error log. This chapter quantifies the token tax by language, traces its technical root cause through byte-pair encoding mechanics, and gives you the mitigation strategies -- from tokenizer selection to prompt compression to cost-model adjustment -- that keep your multilingual system economically viable and technically sound.

*You cannot manage what you do not measure, and most teams have never measured their true per-language token cost. Once you understand the tax, the next question is whether your evaluation system is honest about quality -- and that is where translated eval suites betray you.*
