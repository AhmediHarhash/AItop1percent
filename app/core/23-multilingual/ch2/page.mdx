# Chapter 2 — Multilingual Model Selection

The base model you choose sets a quality ceiling that no amount of prompting, fine-tuning, or post-processing can overcome. A model trained predominantly on English web text will never produce fluent Urdu medical guidance no matter how carefully you craft the system prompt. In 2026, the multilingual model landscape has fractured into regional specialists and global generalists, with MMLU-ProX evaluations showing performance gaps of up to twenty-four percent between high-resource languages like German and low-resource languages like Swahili on the same model. Qwen and DeepSeek dominate CJK workloads. Mistral and multilingual Llama variants lead in European coverage. And for dozens of African, Southeast Asian, and Indigenous languages, no commercial model delivers production-grade quality at all. Choosing wrong here does not just cost you accuracy -- it locks your product out of entire markets.

*The right model for English is almost never the right model for your next ten languages. The next chapter reveals an even more hidden cost -- the token tax that makes some languages four times more expensive to serve than others, before you write a single line of application code.*
