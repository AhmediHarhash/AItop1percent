# 5.10 — Translation Cost Engineering: The Economics of Multilingual Output

In early 2025, a B2B SaaS company launched multilingual support across nine languages for their AI-powered knowledge management platform. They had budgeted carefully for model inference costs, fine-tuning expenses, and embedding storage. They had not budgeted for translation. Six months after launch, the finance team flagged an anomaly: translation-related expenses -- human review, LLM translation API calls, glossary maintenance, quality audits, and integration engineering -- consumed 34% of the total AI infrastructure budget. Model inference, the line item everyone obsessed over, was 28%. Translation was the largest single cost center in their AI stack, and nobody had modeled it before launch. The company spent the next quarter scrambling to build a cost optimization framework that should have existed before the first translated word shipped.

This story repeats across the industry. Teams plan for compute, plan for storage, plan for API calls -- and treat translation as a rounding error. It is not. At multilingual scale, translation economics become a first-class engineering problem that demands the same rigor you apply to model serving costs.

## The Cost Landscape

Translation costs span a spectrum from near-free to extremely expensive, and the right choice depends entirely on the quality requirement for each piece of content.

**Human translation** remains the gold standard for quality. Professional translators charge between $0.08 and $0.30 per word for general content, with specialized domains commanding higher rates. Medical, legal, and financial translation runs $0.15 to $0.40 per word because the translator needs domain expertise, and errors carry regulatory or safety consequences. A 500-word knowledge base article costs $40 to $200 to translate into one language through a professional human translator. Multiply by nine languages and 200 articles, and you are looking at $72,000 to $360,000 just for the initial knowledge base -- before any updates, new content, or dynamic output enters the picture.

**Machine translation post-editing**, or MTPE, reduces cost by starting with machine-translated output and having a human editor correct it. MTPE rates typically run 50 to 75 percent of full human translation rates, landing between $0.04 and $0.15 per word depending on the quality of the initial machine output and the domain complexity. When the machine translation is good -- and for high-resource language pairs with modern NMT or LLM translation, it often is -- the editor makes minor corrections and the workflow is two to three times faster than translating from scratch. When the machine output is poor, the editor may spend more time correcting than they would have spent translating, and the cost advantage disappears.

**LLM translation** through API calls to models like GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.6, or Gemini 3 Pro represents the dramatic cost shift that reshaped multilingual infrastructure between 2024 and 2026. The per-word cost depends on the model and the language, but for a representative calculation: a 500-word English source document produces roughly 700 tokens of input. The translated output in a target language averages 600 to 1,200 tokens depending on the language. At current 2026 API pricing for mid-tier models, the total cost per translation lands between $0.0003 and $0.002 per source word. That same 500-word article costs $0.15 to $1.00 to translate via LLM -- not $40 to $200 as with a human translator. The quality gap has narrowed dramatically since 2024. For high-resource language pairs, LLM translation in 2026 approaches or matches human translation quality on general-purpose content.

**Neural machine translation** through dedicated engines like Google Cloud Translation, Amazon Translate, or DeepL offers the lowest per-word cost at the expense of customization and quality ceiling. At approximately $20 per million characters, NMT costs roughly $0.00003 per word. For bulk, low-stakes content, NMT remains the cheapest option by an order of magnitude. The quality ceiling is lower than LLM translation, particularly for domain-specific terminology, nuanced tone, and low-resource languages.

## Volume Changes Everything

The cost differences between these tiers seem abstract until you project them across real production volumes. Consider a product that generates or updates one million words of translatable content per month -- a realistic figure for a mid-size SaaS product with a knowledge base, help center, marketing content, and AI-generated responses.

At human translation rates of $0.12 per word average, one million words per month costs $120,000 per month per language. Nine languages: $1,080,000 per month. That is $12.9 million per year on translation alone.

At MTPE rates of $0.06 per word, the same volume costs $60,000 per month per language, or $6.5 million per year across nine languages.

At LLM translation rates of $0.001 per word, one million words per month costs $1,000 per month per language, or $108,000 per year across nine languages.

At NMT rates of $0.00003 per word, the cost drops to $30 per month per language, or $3,240 per year across nine languages.

The difference between the human translation approach and the LLM translation approach is $12.8 million per year. Even accounting for the quality review, glossary maintenance, and integration engineering that LLM translation requires, the cost differential is transformative. It is the difference between multilingual support being a strategic luxury reserved for top-revenue markets and multilingual support being a baseline capability that any product can afford.

But these raw per-word numbers obscure a critical nuance: not all content deserves the same treatment.

## The Content Tiering Framework

The most expensive mistake in translation cost engineering is applying a single quality tier to all content. Not every word your product produces carries the same risk, the same user visibility, or the same quality requirement. The teams that manage translation costs effectively do so by routing content to the right cost tier.

**Tier 1: Safety-critical and legally binding content.** Medical instructions, financial disclosures, legal terms, regulatory notifications, and any content where a translation error creates liability. This tier demands human translation or human-reviewed MTPE with domain-expert reviewers. The per-word cost is high, but the volume is typically low -- a few thousand words per language, updated infrequently. Trying to save money on this tier is false economy. A single mistranslated medical dosage or financial disclosure can cost more than a decade of translation budgets.

**Tier 2: User-facing product content.** Help center articles, onboarding flows, feature documentation, marketing pages, and email communications. Users read this content carefully, and quality directly affects trust and brand perception. LLM translation with human post-editing is the cost-quality sweet spot for this tier. The LLM produces a high-quality first draft, and a human editor corrects terminology, adjusts tone, and catches errors. The total cost is typically 30 to 50 percent less than full human translation, with quality that matches or approaches it.

**Tier 3: AI-generated dynamic content.** Chatbot responses, summaries, recommendations, and other model-generated output that users consume but do not archive or reference later. LLM translation without human review is appropriate for this tier, with automated quality monitoring through metrics like COMET or xCOMET scores. The per-word cost is minimal, and the volume is high. Quality issues are caught through sampling and automated scoring rather than exhaustive human review.

**Tier 4: Internal and low-visibility content.** Internal documentation, debug logs, admin panel text, developer-facing content, and community forum translations. NMT or basic LLM translation without review is sufficient. The content serves a functional purpose, and the audience tolerates imperfect translation. Spending human review time on this tier is waste.

The tiering decision is not static. Content can move between tiers as your product matures. A feature that starts with Tier 3 dynamic translations may graduate to Tier 2 once the feature stabilizes and the content becomes part of your core product documentation.

## Hidden Costs That Break Your Budget

Per-word translation costs are the visible line item. The hidden costs often exceed them.

**Glossary and terminology management** requires ongoing investment. Building the initial glossary takes 20 to 40 hours per language for a mid-complexity product. Maintaining it -- adding new terms as features launch, deprecating old terms, resolving conflicts, and distributing updates to translators and LLM prompts -- costs another 5 to 10 hours per language per month. For nine languages, that is 45 to 90 hours of terminology work per month, typically performed by senior linguists or localization managers who command $50 to $100 per hour. Annual cost: $27,000 to $108,000 for terminology management alone.

**Translation memory maintenance** involves deduplication, conflict resolution, quality audits, and term updates as described in the previous subchapter. A mature TM reduces per-word translation costs through reuse, but the TM itself requires maintenance that costs 10 to 20 hours per language per quarter. The ROI is strongly positive -- TM maintenance typically saves three to five times its cost through reduced translation volume -- but it is a real expense that must be budgeted.

**Quality review and evaluation** consumes more time than most teams anticipate. Automated quality scoring through COMET or xCOMET requires infrastructure -- model hosting, pipeline integration, scoring storage, and threshold calibration. Human quality review requires native-speaker reviewers who evaluate samples of translated output. For a nine-language product with rigorous quality standards, the review infrastructure and reviewer time can cost $3,000 to $15,000 per month depending on content volume and review depth.

**Integration engineering** is the one-time cost that teams consistently underestimate. Building the pipeline that routes content to the right translation tier, manages TM lookups, constructs LLM translation prompts with glossary terms and TM examples, runs quality scoring, and handles fallback logic is a non-trivial engineering project. Teams that have built these pipelines report 2 to 4 engineer-months of initial development, plus ongoing maintenance of 10 to 20 percent of an engineer's time.

**Evaluator and annotator costs** appear when you build multilingual evaluation suites. Testing whether your AI system produces culturally appropriate, correctly formatted, properly registered output across nine languages requires native-speaking evaluators for each language. These evaluators create test cases, judge model outputs, and maintain evaluation datasets. For a comprehensive multilingual eval program, expect $2,000 to $8,000 per language per month for evaluator time.

## The Token Tax: Per-Language Cost Variation

Not all languages cost the same to translate with LLMs, even when the API pricing is identical per token. The reason is tokenization efficiency. Most LLM tokenizers were trained primarily on English text, which means English text is tokenized efficiently -- common English words map to single tokens. Other languages, particularly those with non-Latin scripts, are tokenized less efficiently. The same semantic content requires more tokens in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Arabic, and Hindi than it does in English, French, or Spanish.

The impact is measurable. A sentence that tokenizes to 20 tokens in English might tokenize to 35 tokens in Japanese and 40 tokens in Thai using the same tokenizer. Since LLM API pricing is per-token, the same content costs 75 to 100 percent more to translate into or generate in these languages. Over high volumes, this token tax adds up. A product generating one million words of content per month that translates into Japanese pays roughly 1.5 to 2 times the per-token cost compared to translating the same content into French or Spanish.

The token tax also affects generation. When the model generates responses directly in a non-Latin-script language, the output contains more tokens per semantic unit. A Japanese response that conveys the same information as a 100-token English response might require 150 to 200 tokens. The user receives the same amount of information, but you pay for 50 to 100 percent more tokens.

Some model providers have improved tokenization efficiency for non-Latin scripts in their 2025 and 2026 model releases. GPT-5's tokenizer, for example, handles CJK characters significantly more efficiently than GPT-4o's tokenizer did. But the gap has not closed entirely, and for less common scripts -- Thai, Burmese, Georgian, Amharic -- the token tax remains substantial.

Budget for this. If your target languages include CJK, Arabic, Thai, or Hindi, add a 30 to 80 percent markup to your per-word LLM translation cost estimates compared to Latin-script languages. The exact markup depends on the specific model and tokenizer, so run a tokenization benchmark on representative content in each target language before finalizing your budget.

Human translation costs also vary by language, though the drivers are different. Rare language pairs command a premium because fewer qualified translators exist. Translating English to Norwegian costs more per word than translating English to Spanish, simply because the supply of Norwegian translators is smaller. For languages with very small translator pools -- Icelandic, Swahili, Khmer -- the per-word premium can be 50 to 150 percent above rates for high-resource languages.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

Once you understand the cost landscape and have tiered your content, six strategies reduce translation costs without sacrificing quality where it matters.

**Cache aggressively.** Many AI products translate the same or similar content repeatedly. A help center chatbot answering the same ten questions in Japanese generates the same translations hundreds of times. Cache translated responses keyed on a hash of the source content, target language, and translation parameters. A well-implemented translation cache reduces LLM translation API calls by 40 to 70 percent for products with repetitive query patterns.

**Leverage translation memory for cost reduction, not just consistency.** Every TM exact match is a translation you do not pay for -- not from a human translator, not from an LLM API. At 50 percent match rates, your effective translation volume drops by half. At 70 percent match rates, which mature TMs reach after two to three years, your effective volume drops by 70 percent. The TM pays for itself within the first quarter of operation for most products.

**Batch similar content.** LLM translation is cheaper and more consistent when you batch related content together. Translating 50 help center articles in a single batch with shared context -- glossary terms, style guidance, and domain context in the system prompt -- produces better results than translating each article individually. Batching also amortizes the fixed-cost tokens in the system prompt across more content, reducing the effective per-word cost.

**Route by quality tier automatically.** Build pipeline logic that classifies incoming content into tiers based on content type, source, and risk level, then routes it to the appropriate translation method. A new legal disclaimer routes to human translation. A new help article routes to LLM translation with MTPE. A chatbot response routes to LLM translation with automated scoring. A debug log routes to NMT. This routing happens automatically, without manual triage.

**Negotiate volume pricing.** If you consume significant LLM API volume for translation, negotiate volume discounts or reserved capacity with your provider. Similarly, establish retainer agreements with translation agencies for your Tier 1 and Tier 2 content rather than paying per-project rates. Volume commitments typically reduce per-word costs by 15 to 30 percent for human and MTPE translation.

**Invest in source content quality.** Poorly written source content costs more to translate because the translator or LLM must interpret ambiguous meaning, resolve inconsistencies, and make judgment calls that add time and reduce consistency. Clean, well-structured source content with consistent terminology translates faster, cheaper, and more accurately. Style guides and content templates for source content are translation cost reduction tools, even though they do not look like translation investments.

## ROI Modeling: When Translation Pays for Itself

Translation is not a cost. It is an investment. The return on that investment varies dramatically by market, and modeling it correctly determines which languages justify which quality tiers.

The core formula is simple in concept: compare the revenue or value generated by users in a target language against the total cost of supporting that language, including translation, localization, quality assurance, and ongoing maintenance.

A practical example. Your product generates $2.4 million per year from Japanese users. Your total cost of Japanese language support -- Tier 2 LLM translation with MTPE for product content, Tier 3 LLM translation for dynamic content, Tier 1 human translation for legal text, glossary maintenance, quality review, and evaluator time -- is $180,000 per year. The ROI is 13.3 to 1. Japanese language support is a clear investment win.

Now consider your Thai market, generating $120,000 per year. The same quality tier structure costs $95,000 per year because Thai has a higher token tax, a smaller translator pool commanding higher per-word rates, and fewer TM matches due to lower content volume. The ROI is 1.26 to 1 -- barely positive. This is where the tiering framework earns its value. You can reduce Thai costs to $40,000 per year by shifting product content from Tier 2 to Tier 3, reducing human review sampling from 20 percent to 5 percent, and accepting slightly lower quality in a market where you are still establishing presence. The adjusted ROI is 3 to 1, which is viable.

The ROI model should also account for growth. A language that generates $120,000 today but is growing 40 percent year over year will generate $235,000 next year and $330,000 the year after. Investing in quality translation infrastructure for a high-growth market is a forward investment, not a current-period cost optimization.

Markets that generate less translation revenue than their translation costs deserve honest evaluation. If your Estonian market generates $8,000 per year and translation support costs $25,000 per year with no growth trajectory, supporting Estonian is a strategic decision, not a financial one. It might be justified by contractual obligations, regulatory requirements, or market presence goals. But it should not be justified by pretending the economics work when they do not.

## The Annual Translation Budget

Building an annual translation budget requires summing all cost components, not just per-word translation fees.

Start with content volume projections. How many words of new content will your product produce per month? Include knowledge base updates, help center articles, product documentation, marketing content, transactional emails, and an estimate of AI-generated dynamic content volume. Most teams underestimate dynamic content volume by 50 to 200 percent in their first year of multilingual support.

Apply your tiering framework. What percentage of content falls into each tier? For a typical B2B SaaS product, Tier 1 is 2 to 5 percent of volume, Tier 2 is 15 to 30 percent, Tier 3 is 50 to 65 percent, and Tier 4 is 10 to 20 percent.

Calculate per-tier costs using the rates for your chosen translation methods, adjusted for language-specific factors like the token tax and translator pool premiums.

Add hidden costs: glossary maintenance, TM maintenance, quality review infrastructure, evaluator time, and integration engineering amortized over its expected lifespan.

Apply TM discount. If you have a mature TM with 50 percent match rates, reduce your Tier 2 and Tier 3 translation volumes by that match rate, since those segments are served from TM rather than fresh translation.

The result is a comprehensive translation budget that accounts for every cost center. Teams that build this budget before launch make better tiering decisions, negotiate better rates, and avoid the mid-year budget shock that hit the SaaS company in the opening story.

The per-word costs are manageable. The quality assurance costs are manageable. The combination, at scale, across languages, across content tiers, across time -- that is the engineering problem. And the next subchapter tackles the most overlooked piece of it: how you actually verify that the translations your system produces are correct, consistent, and culturally appropriate before your users discover they are not.
