# 12.3 — Language Rights Legislation: Accessibility Requirements by Market

Most AI teams think of language support as a product decision. In a growing number of jurisdictions, it is a legal requirement. The EU AI Act gets the headlines, but language rights laws that predate artificial intelligence by decades are quietly creating compliance obligations that catch teams off guard. These are not AI-specific regulations. They are language protection laws — originally written for government services, public signage, and education — that now extend to any digital service touching their jurisdiction. When your AI-powered product becomes the interface between a government agency and its citizens, or between a regulated business and its customers, you inherit the language obligations of the service you are replacing. Teams that discover this after launch learn it through regulatory notices, not blog posts.

## Canada: The Official Languages Act and the Bilingual Mandate

Canada's Official Languages Act, modernized through Bill C-13 in June 2023, establishes English and French as the two official languages of the federal government and mandates that all federal services be available in both. The modernization was not cosmetic. It was a direct response to the growing dominance of English in digital services, with the explicit recognition that new technologies — including AI — are no guarantee that services will be of equal quality in both official languages.

For AI products serving Canadian federal institutions, the bilingual mandate is absolute. If your AI system powers a federal government chatbot, triages immigration applications, or generates responses for a federal service desk, it must function in both English and French at equivalent quality. Not "good enough" French. Equivalent French. The Commissioner of Official Languages has the power to investigate complaints and, under the modernized Act, can impose administrative monetary penalties on institutions that fail to provide equal-quality services in both languages.

The equal-quality standard is more demanding than it sounds. A chatbot that answers English questions with nuanced, contextually appropriate responses and French questions with grammatically correct but stilted prose is not providing equal quality. A document summarization tool that captures subtle distinctions in English legal text but flattens those distinctions in French summaries is not providing equal quality. The Canadian framework does not ask whether both languages work. It asks whether both languages work equally well. For AI systems where English performance is typically ten to twenty points higher than French on any given quality metric, meeting this standard requires deliberate investment in French-specific evaluation, French-language training data, and French-speaking annotators.

The practical impact extends beyond federal services. The modernized Act also created the Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act, which applies to private-sector organizations in federally regulated industries — banking, telecommunications, transportation, broadcasting. If your AI product serves a Canadian bank's customer service operation, the bank's language obligations flow downstream to your product. The bank cannot satisfy its bilingual requirements by deploying an AI system that handles English at 93% quality and French at 74% quality. Your quality gap becomes their compliance gap.

## Quebec: Bill 96 and the Strengthening of French

Quebec operates under its own language regime that is significantly more aggressive than the federal framework. Bill 96, which amended Quebec's Charter of the French Language, strengthened French language requirements in phases. The June 2025 compliance deadline brought enhanced requirements for French in commercial advertising, product inscriptions, and business communications. Companies with twenty-five or more employees operating in Quebec must register with the Office quebecois de la langue francaise and undergo a francization process.

For AI products, Bill 96 creates specific and often surprising obligations. Contracts of adhesion — standard-form contracts including those made online — must be presented in French first. If your AI product generates contracts, terms of service, or any standard business document for Quebec users, the French version must be the primary version. This is not a translation requirement. It is a primacy requirement. The French text is the authoritative version. If there is a discrepancy between the French and English versions, the French text prevails under Section 7.1 of the Charter.

The fines for non-compliance range from $3,000 to $30,000 per violation, which accumulates quickly for AI systems that generate non-compliant outputs at scale. An AI system that produces a hundred English-first contracts per day in Quebec is potentially generating a hundred violations per day. The financial exposure is not theoretical. The Office quebecois de la langue francaise actively enforces these requirements and has increased its enforcement activity since Bill 96 took effect.

The deeper implication for AI teams is that Quebec requires French-first thinking, not English-first with French translation. If your system's architecture generates English output and then translates it to French, you have built an English-first system that happens to produce French. Under Bill 96, that architectural choice is itself a compliance risk, because the French output is derivative rather than primary. The teams that handle Quebec correctly build French-native generation capabilities — prompts authored in French, few-shot examples in French, evaluation rubrics designed by French speakers — rather than relying on translation layers.

## Belgium: Three Languages, Three Regions, Three Rule Sets

Belgium's language legislation is among the most complex in the world, and AI products that serve the Belgian market must navigate it without simplification. Belgium has three official languages — Dutch, French, and German — distributed across four language areas: the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region, the French-speaking Walloon Region, the German-speaking Community in the East Cantons, and the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.

The principle of territoriality governs language use in Belgium. This means the official language for government and public services in a given region is the language of that region. In Flanders, public services must be provided in Dutch. In Wallonia, they must be in French. In the East Cantons, they must be in German. In Brussels, they must be available in both Dutch and French. These are not suggestions. They are constitutional requirements rooted in the 1932 and 1962 language laws and reinforced by decades of subsequent legislation.

For AI products serving Belgian public institutions, the territorial principle means you cannot deploy a single-language system to a national agency. A federal chatbot must function in Dutch, French, and German. A digital service for the Brussels-Capital Region must function in both Dutch and French. A system deployed for a Flemish municipality that only works in French is not just a poor user experience — it is a violation of language legislation. The requirements extend to all public-facing communications: signage, documents, correspondence, and by extension, AI-generated content that substitutes for these communications.

The Belgian framework also affects private-sector employers. In Flanders, the language of employer-employee relations is Dutch. Employment contracts, internal communications, and workplace instructions must be in Dutch. If your AI tool generates HR communications, performance reviews, or workplace policies for a Flemish employer, those outputs must be in Dutch. Providing them in French or English, even if the employee speaks those languages, violates the language decree. For AI systems that generate workplace content, this means per-region language routing is a legal requirement, not a UX enhancement.

## Switzerland: Four Languages, Pragmatic Equality

Switzerland recognizes four national languages — German, French, Italian, and Romansh — and the principle that citizens can interact with federal authorities in their own national language. The Federal Act on the National Languages and Understanding between Linguistic Communities requires federal services to be available in German, French, and Italian, with Romansh supported for communication with Romansh-speaking citizens.

The Swiss approach is more pragmatic than the Belgian one. While Belgium enforces strict territorial language boundaries, Switzerland allows more flexibility in implementation. Federal documents are published in German, French, and Italian simultaneously. Federal agencies must be able to communicate with citizens in any of the three main languages. But the Swiss framework does not impose the same degree of per-region enforcement that Belgium does, creating somewhat more room for AI products to implement language support progressively.

That said, the Swiss Federal Administration's language policies create specific requirements for AI products deployed in federal contexts. A document classification system used by a federal ministry must process documents in German, French, and Italian with comparable accuracy. A citizen-facing AI assistant must respond in the citizen's language, not the language that happens to be easiest for the model. The expectation of linguistic equality is embedded in Swiss institutional culture, and AI systems that visibly favor one language over another — faster responses in German, more detailed answers in German, higher accuracy in German — will face institutional pushback even before they face regulatory scrutiny.

For commercial AI products serving the Swiss market, the practical requirement is supporting at least three languages at comparable quality. Switzerland is a high-value market with per-capita AI spending among the highest in Europe. But it is also a market where linguistic equality is a deeply held value, not just a regulatory checkbox. Products that serve German-speaking Switzerland well and treat French and Italian as afterthoughts will lose market trust that is difficult to rebuild.

## Spain: Co-Official Languages and Regional Autonomy

Spain recognizes Spanish as the official language of the entire state and recognizes co-official languages in specific autonomous communities: Catalan in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia; Basque in the Basque Country and parts of Navarre; Galician in Galicia; and Aranese in the Val d'Aran. Citizens in these communities have the right to use their co-official language in all interactions with public authorities, and public institutions have a duty of linguistic availability — they must be able to serve citizens in the co-official language of their choice.

For AI products deployed in Spanish public services, the co-official language obligations are concrete. A chatbot for the Catalan government must function in Catalan, not just Spanish. A digital service for the Basque regional health system must work in Basque. A document processing system for the Galician administration must handle Galician input and produce Galician output. These requirements apply even when the citizen also speaks Spanish, because the right to use a co-official language is an individual right that does not depend on whether the citizen has alternative options.

The technical challenge is significant. Catalan is a well-resourced language with substantial digital text, and most modern frontier models handle it reasonably well. Basque, by contrast, is a language isolate — unrelated to any other living language — with a complex morphological system and substantially less training data in most model corpora. AI systems that perform well in Catalan may struggle with Basque, and the quality gap between these two co-official languages can be twenty or more points on standard metrics. The regulatory requirement, however, does not scale with technical difficulty. The Basque-speaking citizen has the same language rights as the Catalan-speaking citizen.

Spain's autonomous communities have been increasingly active in enforcing language requirements for digital services. The Generalitat de Catalunya has published guidelines for the use of Catalan in AI systems, and Basque language institutions have raised concerns about AI products that claim multilingual support but perform poorly in Basque. For teams building AI products for the Spanish market, supporting Spanish alone is not sufficient if the product will serve autonomous communities with co-official languages.

## India: Twenty-Two Scheduled Languages and Growing Digital Reach

India's linguistic landscape is the most complex of any major digital market. The Constitution recognizes Hindi and English as official languages of the Union, and the Eighth Schedule lists twenty-two scheduled languages — including Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, and Punjabi — that the government is constitutionally obligated to develop. The Official Languages Act of 1963 established Hindi as the primary official language and English as a supplementary official language, with specific rules for communications based on regional classification.

For AI products targeting Indian government services, the language requirements are layered. Central government communications with states in Region A — including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh — must be in Hindi, with any English communication accompanied by a Hindi translation. Communications with Region C states — which include Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and most of southern and northeastern India — can be in English or Hindi, but responses to Hindi communications must be in Hindi. The practical implication for AI systems is that language routing is not just a UX decision. It is a regulatory requirement tied to the geographic classification of the recipient.

India's digital transformation agenda, including the Digital India program and the expansion of government services through digital platforms, is creating a new category of AI language obligation. As AI-powered services replace or augment government offices, they inherit the language obligations of the services they replace. A chatbot for the Indian Railways booking system needs to function in Hindi and English at minimum, and increasingly faces pressure to support regional languages for states where Hindi adoption is politically contested. The tension between Hindi as the primary official language and the linguistic identity of non-Hindi-speaking states — particularly in southern India — means that AI language choices carry political as well as regulatory weight.

The commercial opportunity and regulatory complexity are intertwined. India has over 900 million internet users as of 2026, and vernacular internet usage is growing faster than English usage. AI products that serve the Indian market in English alone are missing the majority of potential users. But serving even five or six major Indian languages at production quality requires significant investment in language-specific evaluation, because the quality gap between Hindi and less-resourced scheduled languages like Odia or Assamese can be thirty to forty points on standard metrics with current frontier models.

## South Africa: Eleven Official Languages and the Use of Official Languages Act

South Africa's Constitution recognizes eleven official languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Sepedi, Tswana, Sesotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Ndebele. The Use of Official Languages Act of 2012 requires national government institutions to adopt language policies that provide for effective communication in at least three official languages, and to make those policies publicly available.

For AI products deployed in South African government services, the Act creates a minimum three-language requirement. The specific three languages depend on the institution's language policy, which must consider the languages most commonly used by the institution's target audience. In practice, most national institutions adopt English, Zulu, and Afrikaans or Xhosa as their three primary languages, but regional institutions may require different combinations.

The technical challenge for AI in South Africa is severe. English and Afrikaans are relatively well-resourced in most model training data. Zulu and Xhosa have moderate but growing digital text corpora. But languages like Venda, Tsonga, and Ndebele have minimal representation in the training data of most frontier models, and model quality in these languages is often below usable thresholds. South Africa's Department of Sport, Arts and Culture actively funds human language technology projects through its National Language Service, including projects focused on developing language resources for under-resourced official languages. But the gap between government ambition for eleven-language digital services and the current capability of AI systems in those languages remains substantial.

The compliance path for AI teams targeting South Africa is to work closely with the deploying institution's language policy, support the three designated languages at production quality, and be transparent about limitations in the remaining languages. Claiming eleven-language support when your system produces incoherent output in eight of them is not compliance — it is misrepresentation.

## The European Accessibility Act and Language

The European Accessibility Act, which came into force on June 28, 2025, adds another dimension to multilingual AI obligations. The Act requires that digital products and services be accessible to persons with disabilities, and accessibility has direct language implications.

Screen readers must be able to read your AI-generated content correctly, which means your output must use proper language tags so the screen reader knows which language pronunciation rules to apply. If your system generates a response that mixes French and English without proper language identification, a screen reader will mispronounce the text, making it inaccessible. Text-to-speech systems must function in every language your product supports — if your product claims to support Dutch but your TTS engine cannot produce intelligible Dutch speech, visually impaired Dutch-speaking users are excluded. Speech-to-text input must work in all supported languages — if your voice interface handles English accurately but cannot parse spoken Italian, Italian-speaking users with motor disabilities who depend on voice input are locked out.

The intersection of accessibility and language rights creates a compliance surface that many teams miss entirely. You must not only support multiple languages but support them in multiple modalities — text, speech input, speech output, screen reader compatibility — and each modality must work at a quality level that constitutes genuine access, not a degraded experience presented as accommodation.

## The Pattern: Digital Obligations Inherit Linguistic Obligations

Across all these jurisdictions, a common pattern emerges. Countries with linguistic minorities or multiple official languages developed language rights frameworks decades before AI existed. Those frameworks were designed for human services — government offices, schools, courts, hospitals. As digital services replace human services, the language obligations transfer. As AI replaces digital services, the obligations transfer again. Your AI product does not get a special exemption because it is new technology. It inherits the obligations of the service it replaces.

This pattern is accelerating. In 2024 and 2025, regulatory bodies in multiple jurisdictions began explicitly extending language rights frameworks to digital and AI-powered services. Canada's Official Languages Commissioner investigated AI-powered federal services for bilingual compliance. Belgium's language monitoring bodies evaluated digital government services for regional language compliance. Spain's autonomous communities developed AI-specific language guidelines. The direction is clear: as AI becomes the primary interface for public services, language rights enforcement will follow.

## The Compliance Strategy: Map Before You Build

The teams that handle multilingual compliance successfully share one characteristic: they map their target markets to their language requirements before building, not after a regulatory notice forces them to retrofit.

The mapping exercise is straightforward but labor-intensive. For each target market, answer four questions. First, what are the official or co-official languages, and what legislation governs their use in public and commercial services? Second, which of those languages does your AI system need to support based on the specific use case — government-facing, consumer-facing, enterprise-facing? Third, what quality level does the legislation require — equal quality, adequate quality, or minimum viability? Fourth, what are the consequences of non-compliance — fines, contract termination, market exclusion, or reputational damage?

This mapping should happen during product planning, not during compliance review. The language requirements of your target markets should influence your model selection, your evaluation strategy, your annotator hiring, and your quality thresholds. A team that discovers Belgium's three-language requirement after building a French-only system for the Belgian market has wasted months of engineering time. A team that discovers Quebec's French-first requirement after building an English-first generation pipeline faces an architectural rebuild. A team that discovers India's regional language complexity after committing to a Hindi-and-English-only approach has miscalculated its market potential.

The mapping also reveals which markets are not yet viable. If your AI system cannot produce usable output in Basque, and your target customer is the Basque regional government, that market is not ready for your product regardless of how well it handles Spanish. Knowing this before you invest in sales and marketing for that market saves resources and preserves credibility. Promising capability you cannot deliver is worse than honestly declining the opportunity.

Language rights legislation is not going away. It is expanding. As AI systems become more pervasive in public services, education, healthcare, and commercial interactions, the jurisdictions that have always protected linguistic minorities will extend those protections to AI-mediated interactions. The teams that build their compliance architecture today — mapping markets, measuring per-language quality, documenting capabilities and limitations, implementing language-aware routing — will be positioned for every market they enter. The teams that treat language support as a product decision rather than a legal obligation will keep discovering, market by market, that the law disagrees.

The next subchapter shifts from legal obligations to financial ones, examining the cost structures that make multilingual AI systems fundamentally different from monolingual ones — and how to model per-language unit economics before the costs surprise you.
