# Chapter 8 — Multilingual UX and Interaction Design

Multilingual failures often happen not in the model but in the product layer — right-to-left rendering that mirrors incorrectly, text that truncates mid-word because the UI was designed for English string lengths, form validation that rejects perfectly valid names and addresses, and language switching that resets conversation context. Users do not distinguish between model quality and interface quality. A model that produces perfect Arabic text inside a left-to-right interface is a broken product. A model that generates flawless Japanese but displays it in a font that mangles kanji is a broken product. The gap between what the model can do and what the user actually experiences is the UX layer, and in multilingual systems, that layer is where adoption lives or dies.
