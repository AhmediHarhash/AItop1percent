# 5.5 — Adaptive Translation: Context-Aware, Tone-Aware, Domain-Aware

In late 2025, an e-commerce platform expanded into Japan and Germany with AI-generated product descriptions. The translations were accurate. Every word meant what it was supposed to mean. But the luxury handbag descriptions in Japanese used casual, everyday language -- the kind you would hear between friends at a convenience store, not the aspirational register a customer expects when considering a $2,400 handbag. The German product descriptions addressed customers with the informal "du" -- appropriate for a youth streetwear brand, disastrous for a platform selling professional business attire to corporate buyers. The tone was wrong across 40,000 product listings. User engagement in Japan dropped 35% compared to English-language benchmarks. German conversion rates on premium categories fell by half. The translations were correct. The brand voice was destroyed.

The root cause was not a translation error. It was the absence of adaptive translation -- a system that adjusts not just the words but the tone, the formality, the register, and the domain vocabulary to match the context of each piece of content. The platform treated translation as a uniform function: text goes in, translated text comes out. But translation that ignores context is like a musician who plays every note correctly but ignores the tempo, dynamics, and mood of the piece. Technical accuracy without adaptive control produces output that is right and wrong at the same time.

## What Adaptive Translation Means

Adaptive translation is translation that changes its behavior based on context. The context has at least three dimensions, each of which must be explicitly controlled, not left to the model's default.

The first dimension is **content context** -- what came before and what comes after the text being translated. A sentence in isolation is ambiguous. The word "bank" might mean a financial institution or a riverbank. The phrase "please confirm" might be a polite request or a legal instruction, depending on whether it appears in a customer email or a compliance workflow. Traditional NMT engines translate sentences one at a time, in isolation. Each sentence is a fresh start. This produces translations that are locally correct but globally incoherent -- the same term translated three different ways in the same document, a formal register in one paragraph and a casual register in the next, a pronoun reference that made sense in the source language but breaks when the preceding sentence was translated with different vocabulary.

The second dimension is **tone and register** -- the emotional quality and social positioning of the text. Marketing copy persuades. Technical documentation instructs. Customer support empathizes. Legal text commands. Error messages apologize. Each content type has a different relationship with the reader, and that relationship must survive translation. A support message that says "We are sorry for the inconvenience" carries warmth and accountability in English. Translated into Japanese with the wrong register, it can sound either dismissively casual or absurdly over-formal, depending on which keigo level the translator selects.

The third dimension is **domain vocabulary** -- the specialized terminology that distinguishes one field from another. Medical translation uses clinical terminology: "myocardial infarction," not "heart attack." Legal translation uses juridical precision: "notwithstanding the foregoing," not "despite what was said." Financial translation uses regulatory vocabulary: "material adverse change," not "big bad thing that happened." When a translation system lacks domain awareness, it defaults to general-purpose vocabulary that may be technically correct but signals to the reader that the system does not speak their professional language.

## Why NMT Cannot Adapt

Neural machine translation engines are trained to maximize translation accuracy across a broad distribution of text. They produce one translation for one input, and that translation reflects the statistical average of how similar sentences were translated in their training data. You cannot tell a standard NMT engine to "be more formal" or "use medical terminology" or "match this brand voice guide." The engine does not accept instructions. It accepts text and returns text.

Some NMT providers offer custom models -- engines fine-tuned on your domain-specific data. DeepL's glossary feature allows you to specify that certain source terms must always be translated to specific target terms. Google AutoML Translation lets you train a custom NMT model on your parallel corpora. These features are useful but limited. A custom glossary handles terminology but not tone. A custom model trained on medical data handles medical terminology but still cannot distinguish between formal and informal register within that domain. And neither feature handles the content-context problem -- the need to maintain coherence across paragraphs.

The fundamental limitation is architectural. NMT engines process fixed-size input windows with no mechanism for receiving instructions about how to translate. They are translation functions, not translation collaborators. You provide input and accept whatever output the engine produces.

## How LLMs Enable Adaptive Translation

Large language models changed adaptive translation from a wishful idea to a production capability. The mechanism is simple: LLMs accept natural-language instructions alongside the text to be translated.

When you translate with Claude Opus 4.6 or GPT-5, you do not just send the source text. You send the source text embedded in a prompt that specifies the target language, the tone, the formality level, the domain, the terminology constraints, any terms that must not be translated, and any other adaptive parameters relevant to the content. The model reads these instructions and adjusts its translation behavior accordingly. This is not a hack or a workaround. It is the fundamental capability that separates LLM-based translation from NMT-based translation.

The practical result is that a single LLM can produce dramatically different translations of the same source text depending on the instructions. The sentence "Please confirm your order details" translates into Japanese with at least four distinct register levels depending on whether the prompt specifies casual, polite, honorific, or maximum-deference keigo. Each version is correct Japanese. Each version communicates the same factual request. But each version positions the brand differently relative to the customer, and the wrong choice can cost conversions, damage trust, or confuse the user about the nature of the interaction.

Context-awareness works because LLMs process long input windows. You can include the surrounding paragraphs -- or even the entire document -- alongside the sentence being translated. The model uses that context to resolve ambiguities, maintain terminology consistency, and keep the register stable across the translation. A paragraph about "bank regulations" where the preceding paragraph discusses financial institutions will correctly translate "bank" as a financial institution, not as a riverbank. An NMT engine translating the same sentence in isolation would have to guess.

## The Translation Brief

The mechanism for controlling adaptive translation is the **translation brief** -- a structured set of instructions that travels with every translation request, telling the model exactly how to translate this specific content.

A well-constructed translation brief includes six components. First, the target language and locale -- not just "Spanish" but "Latin American Spanish for Mexico" or "European Spanish for Spain," because vocabulary, phrasing, and cultural references differ significantly between regional variants. Second, the formality level -- explicit specification of the register the translation should use, calibrated to the target culture's formality system. Third, the domain -- medical, legal, financial, technical, marketing, casual conversation. This cues the model to use domain-appropriate vocabulary and avoid register mismatches. Fourth, the tone descriptor -- empathetic, authoritative, encouraging, neutral, apologetic. Tone is distinct from formality. A message can be formal and empathetic (a corporate apology letter) or informal and authoritative (a technical blog post by an expert). Fifth, the terminology list -- key terms with their mandated translations, plus any terms that must be left untranslated (brand names, product names, technical standards). Sixth, any negative instructions -- things the translation must avoid. "Do not use slang," "Do not shorten proper nouns," "Do not translate URLs or code snippets."

The translation brief does not need to be written from scratch for every request. You build a library of briefs -- one per content type per locale. The product description brief for Japanese specifies formal-polite register, consumer electronics domain, aspirational tone, and a product-specific glossary. The customer support brief for German specifies formal-Sie register, customer service domain, empathetic tone, and a support-specific glossary. When content enters the translation pipeline, the system matches it to the appropriate brief based on content type and target locale, and the brief becomes part of the translation prompt.

Teams that invest in building comprehensive translation briefs report measurably higher translation quality from LLMs. The difference between translating with and without a brief is typically 5 to 15 points on COMET scores for tone-sensitive content. For straightforward factual content, the difference is smaller. For highly register-sensitive content -- luxury marketing, formal business communication, medical patient instructions -- the difference can be the gap between usable and unusable output.

## Formality as a First-Class Parameter

Formality is the most frequently mishandled dimension of adaptive translation, because English speakers tend to underestimate how much formality matters in other languages.

English has a relatively flat formality system. You can adjust tone through word choice and phrasing, but the grammatical structure stays the same whether you are writing to your friend or your CEO. Many other languages encode formality directly into grammar, vocabulary, and verb conjugations. Getting the formality wrong is not a subtle tone issue. It is a grammatical and social error that native speakers notice immediately.

**Japanese** has three primary politeness layers that most translation systems need to handle. Plain form is used between close friends and in casual writing. Polite form, built around the "desu/masu" verb endings, is the default for most public-facing communication. Keigo, the honorific system, has three sub-levels: respectful language that elevates the listener, humble language that lowers the speaker, and polite language that maintains general courtesy. A customer-facing AI product in Japan almost always needs polite form at minimum, with keigo for premium brands, formal customer communications, and any context involving someone of higher social status. Using plain form where keigo is expected signals disrespect -- not the kind that offends, but the kind that erodes trust. The user feels the product was not built for them.

**Korean** has seven speech levels, though modern usage has consolidated these into roughly four that matter for AI products: intimate, casual, polite, and formal. The polite level, using the "yo" verb ending, is the safest default for most customer interactions. The formal level, using the "mnida" ending, is appropriate for official communications, corporate contexts, and any situation where the user expects institutional formality. Mixing levels within a single interaction -- starting formal, then dropping to casual mid-conversation -- reads as inconsistent and unprofessional.

**German** distinguishes between "du" (informal you) and "Sie" (formal you). The choice affects not just pronouns but verb conjugations and possessive forms throughout the text. B2C brands targeting younger audiences increasingly use "du." B2B products, financial services, healthcare providers, and government-facing tools almost universally use "Sie." Getting this wrong is immediately noticeable to every German speaker. It is the equivalent of starting a business email with "Hey dude" in English -- technically communicative, socially wrong.

**French** has a similar "tu/vous" distinction. **Spanish** has "tu/usted," with regional variation -- Latin American Spanish uses "usted" more broadly than European Spanish. **Arabic** distinguishes formality through vocabulary choices and pronoun usage. **Thai** encodes social hierarchy into particles and pronouns that change based on the speaker's relationship to the listener.

The practical requirement is that your translation system must treat formality as an explicit parameter, not as something the model figures out on its own. If you do not specify formality in your translation prompt, the model will default to whatever register it has seen most often in its training data for that language -- which is usually a generic middle register that is wrong for half your content types. Specify the formality level in the translation brief for every content type and every target locale. Test the output with native speakers who understand the social implications of register choices. Build formality-specific test cases into your evaluation suite.

## Domain-Aware Vocabulary Control

Domain vocabulary is the third axis of adaptive translation, and it is the one that causes the most insidious errors -- errors that look correct to someone outside the domain and are obviously wrong to someone inside it.

Consider the English word "discharge." In a medical context, it means a patient leaving the hospital. In an electrical context, it means a battery releasing its stored energy. In a legal context, it means releasing someone from an obligation. In a military context, it means releasing someone from service. Each meaning translates to a completely different word in most target languages. A translation system without domain awareness picks whichever meaning is statistically most common in its training data, which for "discharge" is typically the medical meaning. When your electrical engineering documentation gets translated with the medical meaning of "discharge," the result is nonsensical to the target audience.

LLM-based translation handles domain vocabulary better than NMT when you include domain specification in the prompt. Telling the model "this is electrical engineering documentation" activates the right semantic frame for ambiguous terms. But even with domain specification, you need an explicit terminology list for terms that have standard translations in your organization or industry. The medical term "adverse event" might translate correctly as the standard regulatory term in French or German, or it might get translated as a generic "bad thing that happened" if the model is not cued to use regulatory vocabulary.

Build domain glossaries for each language pair and each domain your product operates in. These glossaries should include not just preferred translations but also rejected alternatives -- terms that are technically valid translations but wrong for your domain. Include the glossary in the translation prompt or in a retrieval layer that feeds relevant terminology entries into the prompt based on content analysis. Track terminology consistency across translations using automated term-extraction tools that compare the translated output against the glossary and flag deviations.

## Adaptive Translation in Practice

Putting context, tone, and domain awareness together produces a translation pipeline that behaves more like a skilled human translator than a mechanical word-conversion engine.

The pipeline works as follows. Content enters the system with metadata: content type, target locale, source document identifier. The system looks up the translation brief for that content type and locale combination. It retrieves relevant terminology entries from the domain glossary. If the content is part of a larger document, it includes surrounding paragraphs as context. All of these elements -- the source text, the translation brief, the terminology, the context -- are assembled into a translation prompt and sent to the LLM.

The model returns a translation that reflects all of the adaptive parameters: correct formality level, appropriate domain vocabulary, consistent tone, contextually grounded term choices. The output then passes through the quality pipeline described in the previous subchapters -- automated scoring with CometKiwi or xCOMET, flagging of low-confidence segments, and human post-editing where needed.

The key insight is that adaptive translation shifts quality effort upstream. Instead of producing a generic translation and then having a human editor fix the tone, register, and terminology in post-editing, you produce a targeted translation that already handles these dimensions correctly. The human editor's job shifts from "fix everything" to "verify and polish." This reduces post-editing time, lowers cost, and produces higher-quality final output because the editor is refining a good translation rather than rebuilding a mediocre one.

Teams that implement adaptive translation with well-crafted translation briefs consistently report that post-editing effort drops by 30 to 40 percent compared to translating with LLMs but without briefs. For tone-sensitive content like customer communications and marketing copy, the improvement is even larger -- editors who previously spent most of their time fixing register mismatches now spend that time on genuine accuracy improvements. The translation brief pays for itself within the first production cycle.

## The Limits of Adaptation

Adaptive translation has real limits, and understanding them prevents overreliance on a system that is good but not omniscient.

Creative content -- brand taglines, advertising copy, humor, wordplay, poetry -- resists adaptive translation because the value of the content lies in its creative expression, not its informational content. A tagline that works in English through a clever pun cannot be adaptively translated into Japanese by adjusting tone and domain parameters. It needs to be recreated by a native-speaking copywriter who understands both the brand intent and the linguistic possibilities of the target language. This process is called **transcreation**, and it is fundamentally different from translation. Transcreation starts from the intent of the original and creates new content that achieves the same effect in the target language, using whatever words and structures serve that effect best.

Deeply culture-specific content also resists adaptation. A product description that references "Black Friday deals" can be translated and adapted for cultures that celebrate Black Friday, but it needs entirely different content for cultures that do not. A health recommendation based on American dietary guidelines needs not just translation but replacement with local guidelines for markets where dietary norms, available foods, and nutritional standards differ. These are not translation problems. They are content strategy problems that require per-market content creation.

Finally, adaptive translation is only as good as the translation brief. A brief that specifies the wrong formality level produces consistently wrong formality. A glossary that contains incorrect term translations produces consistently incorrect terms. The system faithfully follows instructions, even bad ones. Quality assurance must verify not just the translations but the briefs themselves, reviewed by native speakers who understand the cultural and domain context of each target market.

The next subchapter confronts the most fundamental architectural question in multilingual AI: should your model translate its English output into other languages, or should it generate directly in the target language? Each approach has trade-offs that most teams never evaluate, and the choice shapes cost, quality, and latency across your entire multilingual product.
