# Chapter 12 — Compliance, Cost, and the Global Operating Model

Running multilingual AI means managing regulations across jurisdictions, costs that scale multiplicatively with each language added, revenue models that must justify expansion, and organizational structures that prevent English from always being treated as first-class. The EU AI Act's August 2026 compliance deadline, GDPR cross-border processing rules, and emerging language rights legislation create a regulatory environment where multilingual is not optional — it is mandated. The teams that treat global expansion as a technical problem alone will find themselves blocked by legal, financial, and organizational failures that no amount of engineering can fix.

*Going global is not a launch event — it is an operating model, and the teams that build that model deliberately are the ones still standing three years later.*
