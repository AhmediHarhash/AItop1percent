# Section 22 — Red-Teaming and Adversarial Testing

Every AI system has vulnerabilities. The question is whether you find them before your users do — or before someone with malicious intent does. Red teaming is the discipline of systematically attacking your own system to discover how it breaks, where it leaks information, when it follows instructions it should refuse, and what happens when an adversary probes for weaknesses. It is not penetration testing with a new name. It is not running a few prompt injection examples from Twitter. It is creative, adversarial thinking applied to the entire surface of your AI product — prompts, outputs, training data, guardrails, memory, tool calls, routing logic, feedback loops — to find the failures that matter before they reach production.

In 2026, red teaming has moved from optional security theater to mandatory practice. The EU AI Act requires documented adversarial testing for high-risk systems. Major cloud providers now offer bug bounties specifically for AI vulnerabilities. Insurance carriers ask to see red team reports before underwriting AI liability policies. This section teaches the adversarial mindset — how to think like someone trying to break your system, how to map attack surfaces that traditional security teams miss, how to probe for jailbreaks and data extraction and tool misuse and prompt leakage, how to run structured red team exercises that find real problems, and how to build a continuous adversarial testing practice that hardens your system over time. Red teaming is not a one-time audit. It is an ongoing arms race between your defenses and every possible way an adversary could exploit them.

The core framework for this section is the Attack-Defense Cycle: think like an attacker, map the attack surface, probe systematically, exploit discovered weaknesses, document findings with reproduction steps, harden defenses in response, verify that fixes actually work, and iterate. Each chapter deepens one part of this cycle. By the end, you will understand how to build and run a red team program that makes your AI system genuinely harder to break.

## Chapters

**Chapter 1 — The Adversarial Mindset**: What red teaming is, why it exists, how it differs from penetration testing and security audits, the economics of finding failures early, and the state of AI red teaming in 2026.

**Chapter 2 — The AI Attack Surface**: Identifying every point where an adversary can influence your system — prompts, context, tools, retrieval, models, integrations, multi-agent surfaces, multi-tenant boundaries, and the human layer.

**Chapter 3 — Prompt Injection and Instruction Attacks**: Direct and indirect prompt injection, instruction hierarchy attacks, jailbreaking techniques, encoding and obfuscation attacks, multi-turn manipulation, and defense in depth.

**Chapter 4 — Model-Layer Adversarial Attacks**: Attacks below the prompt — adversarial examples, embedding space manipulation, gradient-based extraction, fine-tuning poisoning, and model supply chain compromise.

**Chapter 5 — Safety Testing and Jailbreaks**: How safety training works and its limits, persuasion-based jailbreaks, context manipulation, fiction framing, language attacks, multimodal bypasses, and building jailbreak regression suites.

**Chapter 6 — Data Extraction and Privacy Attacks**: Training data leakage, PII extraction, system prompt theft, RAG content extraction, cross-user leakage, multi-tenant isolation testing, and compliance implications under GDPR and HIPAA.

**Chapter 7 — Tool Abuse and Authorization Attacks**: Unauthorized tool invocation, parameter manipulation, privilege escalation, chained tool attacks, confused deputy patterns, cost amplification, recursive loops, and the MCP security model.

**Chapter 8 — Agent Red-Teaming**: Why agent testing is different, goal hijacking, runaway behavior, side-effect attacks, multi-agent attacks, memory poisoning, planning attacks, containment verification, and kill switches.

**Chapter 9 — Social Engineering and Harm Amplification**: AI as social engineering amplifier, persuasion and deception generation, impersonation, phishing assistance, radicalization, bias exploitation, and testing for manipulation potential.

**Chapter 10 — Red Team Operations and Methodology**: Planning engagements, scope definition, rules of engagement, team composition, attack scenario development, execution methodology, documentation, severity classification, and reporting.

**Chapter 11 — Automated Adversarial Testing**: Fuzzing for AI systems, LLM-based attack generation, adversarial prompt libraries, mutation-based testing, coverage metrics, false positive management, CI/CD integration, and tooling.

**Chapter 12 — Continuous Red Teaming**: Embedding adversarial testing into operational rhythm, regression testing integration, release pipeline gates, threat intelligence, model update testing, bug bounties, and the red team maturity model.

**Chapter 13 — Enterprise Red Teaming and Compliance**: SOC 2, EU AI Act obligations, industry-specific requirements, third-party assessments, audit documentation, board reporting, vendor and supply chain red teaming, insurance, and the enterprise operating model.

**Chapter 14 — AI Attack Lifecycle and Kill Chain Modeling**: The AI-adapted kill chain from reconnaissance through persistence, lateral movement, exfiltration, and impact. MITRE ATLAS mapping, OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, and full kill chain exercises.

**Chapter 15 — AI Infrastructure and Control Plane Red Teaming**: Attacking the systems around the model — CI/CD pipelines, model registries, prompt registries, secrets management, feature flags, shadow AI, GPU infrastructure, network-level attacks, and container security.

**Chapter 16 — Detection Evasion and Stealth Techniques**: How real attackers avoid detection — log manipulation, token obfuscation, unicode tricks, multi-language evasion, slow-burn attacks, insider threats, human review exploitation, and building detection rules that survive evasion.

**Chapter 17 — Purple Teaming for AI Systems**: Where red and blue meet — feedback loops, SOC playbooks, SIEM integration, detection engineering, response automation, control validation workshops, gap analysis, AI security CTFs, and the purple team operating model.
