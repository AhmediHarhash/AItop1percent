# Chapter 1 — The Adversarial Mindset

Red teaming is not a checklist. It is a way of thinking. It is the discipline of approaching your own system as if you were an adversary with time, creativity, and motivation to make it fail. It means setting aside your assumptions about how the system is supposed to work and asking instead: where can I make it do something it should never do? Where does it trust input it should validate? Where does it expose information it should protect? Where does a clever prompt turn safety guardrails into suggestions? This chapter establishes the adversarial mindset — the fundamental shift from builder to breaker — and explains why red teaming has become non-negotiable for production AI systems in 2026.

You will learn what red teaming is and how it differs from penetration testing, security audits, and traditional QA. You will see the economics of finding vulnerabilities before users do. You will understand when to red team, who should do it, and how to scope an engagement that finds real problems instead of performing security theater. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to think like someone trying to break your system — and why that perspective is the only way to build something genuinely robust.
