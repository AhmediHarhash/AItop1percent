# Chapter 10 — Red Team Operations and Methodology

Ad-hoc testing finds what you expect to break. Systematic red teaming finds what you never imagined could break. The difference between the two is methodology — the structured approach to adversarial testing that turns creative attack thinking into repeatable, comprehensive security validation.

Most organizations run red team engagements as chaotic exercises in creative destruction. A team spends two weeks throwing attacks at a system, documents whatever they find, and calls it complete. What they miss is everything their particular creativity, timeline, and scope decisions didn't cover. The systematic vulnerabilities — the patterns that appear across models, the edge cases that only emerge under specific conditions, the attack chains that require patience to discover — remain hidden until production users find them.

Professional red teaming is not chaos. It is structured creativity applied with discipline. It requires planning, clear scope, defined rules, the right team composition, documented methodology, severity classification, stakeholder communication, remediation verification, and the organizational capability to do it repeatedly. This chapter covers how to build and execute red team operations that actually find what matters before your adversaries do.
