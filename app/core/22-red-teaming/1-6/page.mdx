# 1.6 — The Economics of Red Teaming — Cost of Testing vs Cost of Failure

The finance team asked the question that finance teams always ask: Why are we spending this much on security testing that has not found a production incident yet? The CISO pulled up a spreadsheet. Red teaming budget for the year: two hundred and thirty thousand dollars. Three contracted security researchers, two months of internal engineering time, tooling and infrastructure. Then she pulled up a different spreadsheet. Cost of a single data breach based on their industry benchmarks: four point seven million dollars in direct costs, estimated twenty to thirty million in customer churn and reputation damage over two years. Cost of a regulatory violation under the EU AI Act for a high-risk system: up to seven percent of global annual revenue. For their company, that was eighty million dollars. The red teaming budget was not an expense. It was insurance with a 200-to-1 payout ratio. The finance team approved the increase.

The economic case for red teaming is not subtle. The cost of testing is measured in thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cost of failure is measured in millions to tens of millions. The decision is not whether you can afford red teaming. The decision is whether you can afford not to do it. Every organization that skips adversarial testing is making an implicit bet: that they will discover and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. History suggests this is a bad bet.

## The ROI Calculation — Testing Cost vs Failure Cost

Red teaming costs break down into three categories: labor, tooling, and opportunity cost. Labor is the largest component. A contracted security researcher with AI expertise costs between eight hundred and fifteen hundred dollars per day in 2026. A comprehensive red team engagement for a mid-complexity AI system takes ten to thirty researcher-days, translating to eight thousand to forty-five thousand dollars per engagement. Annual retainer arrangements for ongoing testing typically run sixty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars depending on system complexity and testing frequency.

Internal labor adds to this. Your engineering team spends time responding to findings, reproducing issues, implementing fixes, and verifying remediations. A moderate-severity finding takes one to three days of engineering time to fix properly. A high-severity finding might take one to two weeks. A critical finding might require architectural changes that consume a full sprint. If a red team engagement discovers fifteen findings — typical for a first assessment — that is three to six weeks of engineering time. At fully-loaded costs of twelve hundred to eighteen hundred dollars per day for senior engineers, that is twenty-five thousand to fifty-four thousand dollars in remediation labor.

Tooling costs are smaller but non-trivial. Adversarial testing platforms, automated jailbreak generators, and monitoring infrastructure run two thousand to twenty thousand dollars per year depending on scale. Infrastructure costs for staging environments, logging, and replay systems add another five thousand to fifteen thousand annually. For most organizations, tooling represents 5 to 15 percent of total red teaming cost.

Opportunity cost is the hardest to measure but often the most significant. Engineering time spent fixing vulnerabilities is time not spent building features. A month of team capacity diverted to security remediation is a month of delayed product roadmap. For high-growth startups, this can feel prohibitive. The counter-argument is simple: the opportunity cost of a breach is higher. A public security incident does not just cost money. It destroys customer trust, triggers regulatory scrutiny, and diverts executive attention for months. The opportunity cost of failure dwarfs the opportunity cost of testing.

## Real Incident Costs — Anonymized Examples with Specific Dollar Amounts

A healthcare technology company launched an AI-powered patient triage chatbot in March 2025. They skipped external red teaming to accelerate the launch timeline. In June, a security researcher discovered a prompt injection vulnerability that allowed retrieval of other patients' medical histories. The researcher disclosed responsibly. The company patched within a week. No evidence of malicious exploitation. The direct costs: eighty-five thousand dollars in emergency remediation, twelve thousand in third-party security audit to confirm the fix, thirty-seven thousand in legal review and regulatory disclosure. The indirect costs: the feature was pulled from production for six weeks during remediation, costing an estimated two hundred and fifty thousand in lost revenue. Customer trust degraded measurably — new user signups dropped 22 percent for three months. Total estimated impact: six hundred and forty thousand dollars. The red team engagement they skipped would have cost thirty-five thousand.

A financial services firm deployed an AI agent in October 2025 to automate expense report processing. The agent had access to internal financial systems with read and limited write permissions. No red teaming was conducted before launch. In December, an internal user discovered by accident that the agent could be tricked into retrieving and summarizing financial data from accounts the user did not have access to. This was a privilege escalation vulnerability through tool abuse. The user reported it immediately. The company launched an internal investigation, engaged a forensic security firm, and disclosed the incident to regulators. Direct costs: two hundred and twenty thousand in forensic investigation, ninety-five thousand in regulatory response, one hundred and forty thousand in remediation and enhanced monitoring. Indirect costs: the agent was disabled for four months, forcing the company to revert to manual expense processing, costing an estimated four hundred and seventy thousand in operational inefficiency. Regulatory penalties were avoided because no evidence of malicious exploitation was found and the company demonstrated proactive remediation. Total impact: nine hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. A red team engagement budgeted at seventy thousand was deferred due to competing priorities.

A legal technology company built an AI-powered contract review tool in early 2025. The tool was trained on thousands of client contracts. They conducted internal adversarial testing but did not engage external red teamers. In August 2025, a client discovered that certain queries to the tool returned snippets of other clients' contracts. This was a training data extraction vulnerability. The company immediately pulled the tool offline, notified all clients, and launched a third-party investigation. Direct costs: three hundred and fifty thousand in investigation and remediation, one hundred and ninety thousand in client communication and legal response, eighty-five thousand in rebuilding the training pipeline with differential privacy. Indirect costs: two major clients terminated their contracts due to the breach, representing two point one million in lost annual recurring revenue. The tool remained offline for seven months. Total impact: two point seven million dollars. External red teaming with AI-specific expertise, budgeted at sixty thousand, was declined in favor of relying on internal testing.

## Types of Failure Costs — Direct, Indirect, and Existential

Direct costs are the immediately measurable financial impact. Incident response and forensic investigation. Legal fees and regulatory fines. Remediation engineering and third-party security audits. Customer notification and credit monitoring if personal data is exposed. Downtime costs if the system is taken offline during remediation. These are the costs that appear on the balance sheet within the fiscal quarter of the incident. For mid-severity AI incidents, direct costs range from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand dollars. For high-severity incidents involving regulated data or regulatory violations, direct costs range from five hundred thousand to five million.

Indirect costs accumulate over months to years after the incident. Customer churn as users lose trust. Revenue impact from disabled features or restricted functionality. Reputational damage that reduces new customer acquisition. Increased insurance premiums. Opportunity costs from diverted engineering and leadership attention. Indirect costs are harder to measure precisely but typically exceed direct costs by a factor of three to ten. A breach with two hundred thousand in direct costs might carry one to two million in indirect costs over two years.

Existential costs are the incidents that threaten the company's survival. A startup with a single flagship AI product experiences a catastrophic data breach that becomes public. Customers flee. Investors lose confidence. Regulatory action forces significant operational constraints. The company folds or is acquired at a fraction of previous valuation. For venture-backed startups in regulated industries, a single severe AI security incident before product-market fit can be terminal. The probability is low — most companies survive most incidents — but the consequences are unbounded.

Existential risk is highest for companies where AI is the core product, where the customer base is concentrated, and where regulatory exposure is severe. A healthcare AI company with three major hospital clients operating under HIPAA loses one client due to a data breach and faces an immediate 33 percent revenue drop and potential regulatory penalties. If the breach is severe enough, the other two clients terminate as a precaution. Revenue goes to zero. The company has months of runway to rebuild trust and replace clients. Most do not succeed. The red teaming budget that would have cost a fraction of one percent of annual revenue could have prevented the existential event.

## How to Budget for Red Teaming — Percentage of AI Budget and Headcount Considerations

Industry benchmarks in 2026 suggest that organizations should allocate 5 to 15 percent of total AI security budget to adversarial testing and red teaming. AI security budget is typically 10 to 20 percent of total AI development budget. This means red teaming represents roughly 0.5 to 3 percent of overall AI investment. For a company spending five million dollars annually on AI development, the red teaming budget should be twenty-five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand.

The allocation scales with risk. High-risk systems — those handling regulated data, making consequential decisions, or operating autonomously — justify the high end of the range or beyond. Low-risk systems — internal tools, non-sensitive applications, read-only analytics — can operate at the low end. The key is intentionality. You do not set the budget to an arbitrary percentage. You assess threat landscape, vulnerability surface, and failure impact, then allocate accordingly.

Headcount considerations depend on whether you build internal red team capability or rely on external contractors. Building internal capability requires hiring security engineers with adversarial testing expertise. In 2026, this means candidates with experience in AI security, prompt injection, jailbreak development, or agent exploitation. These are rare skills. Competitive compensation for a senior AI security engineer is one hundred and eighty thousand to two hundred and eighty thousand in total compensation. A dedicated internal red team of two to three engineers can cover continuous testing for a mid-sized AI portfolio but represents five hundred thousand to eight hundred thousand in annual headcount cost.

Most organizations use a hybrid model. One internal security engineer with AI expertise coordinates adversarial testing, runs lightweight continuous probing, and integrates security into development workflows. External red teamers are contracted for deep, periodic assessments — quarterly or semi-annually depending on release velocity. This model keeps headcount lean while ensuring access to cutting-edge adversarial techniques that evolve faster than a single internal hire can track.

The external contractor budget depends on engagement frequency and depth. A quarterly red team engagement at ten to fifteen researcher-days per engagement costs forty thousand to ninety thousand annually. A semi-annual engagement costs twenty thousand to forty-five thousand. Add tooling and infrastructure costs. Add internal engineering time for remediation. A realistic annual red teaming budget for a company with moderate AI exposure is seventy-five thousand to two hundred thousand. For companies with extensive AI surface area, multiple high-risk systems, or regulatory requirements, budgets range from two hundred thousand to one million.

## The Hidden Cost of Not Finding Vulnerabilities Before Attackers Do

The visible cost of red teaming is the budget line item. The hidden cost of skipping red teaming is the risk you carry silently until it materializes. Every day a vulnerability exists in production undetected is a day an attacker could discover and exploit it. The probability on any given day is low. The cumulative probability over months is not.

Consider a prompt injection vulnerability in a customer-facing chatbot. Assume the probability that an attacker discovers and exploits it in any given week is 0.5 percent — low but non-zero. Over one year, the cumulative probability of exploitation is approximately 23 percent. Over two years, 40 percent. The longer the vulnerability exists, the higher the chance it gets found. Red teaming compresses the discovery timeline from months-to-years down to days-to-weeks. You find it during a scheduled engagement instead of discovering it through a user report or, worse, a breach notification.

The cost differential is asymmetric. If you find the vulnerability through red teaming, you fix it quietly, no customer impact, no public disclosure, no reputational damage. If an attacker finds it first, you respond reactively under time pressure with incomplete information while customers are potentially already affected. Reactive response costs three to ten times more than proactive remediation. You pay for incident response, forensics, legal, public relations, regulatory disclosure, and customer remediation. You lose customer trust. You face regulatory scrutiny. All of these costs are avoided if red teaming finds the vulnerability first.

There is also the second-order cost of building defenses without adversarial feedback. Teams that do not red-test their systems build defenses against imagined threats, not real ones. They implement mitigations that sound good in design docs but fail under actual attack. They prioritize low-impact vulnerabilities because they are easy to understand while missing high-impact vulnerabilities that require adversarial creativity to discover. Red teaming provides ground truth. It shows you what actually breaks, not what you theoretically worry about. The systems that undergo continuous adversarial testing develop more effective defenses per dollar spent because the feedback loop is connected to reality.

## Building the Business Case for Red Teaming Investment

The business case writes itself once you frame the question correctly. The incorrect framing is: Should we spend money on red teaming when we have not had an incident yet? The correct framing is: What is the expected value of avoiding a high-probability, high-impact event? If the probability of a severe incident over two years without red teaming is 15 percent and the cost of that incident is three million dollars, the expected cost is four hundred and fifty thousand. If red teaming costs one hundred and fifty thousand over two years and reduces incident probability to 3 percent, the expected cost drops to ninety thousand. The net value of red teaming is three hundred and sixty thousand dollars.

You build the business case by quantifying three numbers: incident probability without red teaming, incident cost if it occurs, and reduction in probability with red teaming. Incident probability comes from industry benchmarks, peer company experiences, and vulnerability prevalence data. Incident cost comes from case studies like those described earlier in this subchapter. Reduction in probability is conservatively estimated at 60 to 80 percent — red teaming does not eliminate risk, but it dramatically reduces it.

Present the case in terms executives understand. Red teaming is not a cost center. It is risk mitigation with measurable ROI. The alternative to red teaming is not zero cost. The alternative is carrying unquantified risk that materializes unpredictably and costs orders of magnitude more to address reactively. Every dollar spent on proactive adversarial testing saves three to twenty dollars in avoided incident response.

Include regulatory and compliance considerations. In industries subject to the EU AI Act, routine adversarial testing is increasingly expected as part of demonstrating risk management for high-risk systems. Failure to conduct adversarial testing can be interpreted as negligence if an incident occurs. The cost of red teaming is fully justified by compliance requirements alone, even before considering the direct risk reduction benefits.

## When to Invest More vs Less in Red Teaming — Risk-Based Prioritization

Not every AI system requires the same level of adversarial testing investment. Risk-based prioritization focuses resources where impact is highest. High-risk systems — those that access sensitive data, make consequential decisions, operate autonomously, or face regulatory scrutiny — justify significant red teaming investment. Low-risk systems — internal tools with limited access, read-only analytics, non-sensitive creative applications — require lighter testing or can rely on automated checks.

The prioritization framework considers four factors: data sensitivity, decision impact, autonomy level, and regulatory exposure. A customer service chatbot that accesses user account data, makes refund decisions, and operates autonomously scores high on all four factors. This system requires quarterly red team engagements, continuous automated testing, and dedicated security monitoring. An internal document summarization tool that processes public information, makes no decisions, and requires human review scores low on all four. This system might receive annual red team assessment and rely primarily on automated adversarial checks in CI/CD.

Investment scales with system maturity. A new AI feature in early development receives lightweight adversarial review during design, automated testing during development, and a focused red team engagement before launch. A mature system in production for over a year with no major changes receives lighter ongoing testing but deeper assessments when significant updates occur. The goal is continuous coverage proportional to risk, not uniform coverage across all systems.

External attack surface also determines investment level. A public-facing API used by millions of users requires more rigorous testing than an internal tool used by fifty employees. The public system has vastly larger attacker exposure. More attackers will probe it. More automated scanners will hit it. More sophisticated adversaries will target it. The investment in red teaming must match the threat level.

Organizations operating multiple AI systems use portfolio-based budgeting. Allocate 60 to 70 percent of red teaming budget to the highest-risk 20 percent of systems. Allocate 20 to 30 percent to medium-risk systems. Allocate 10 to 20 percent to broad automated testing across all systems. This ensures your most critical systems receive deep, expert-driven adversarial testing while maintaining baseline coverage across your entire AI portfolio.

The next subchapter begins the technical deep-dive into red teaming practice, starting with threat modeling — the structured process of identifying what you should be testing and why.
