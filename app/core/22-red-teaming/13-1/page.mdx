# 13.1 — Enterprise Red Teaming Requirements

The enterprise buyer does not ask whether you do red teaming. They ask whether you can prove it. In early 2025, a B2B AI platform lost a contract worth seven million dollars because their red teaming process was informal. They tested their models. They found vulnerabilities. They fixed them. But when the enterprise customer asked for documentation showing methodology, frequency, findings, and remediation timelines, the vendor had nothing to show. No formal process. No written findings. No audit trail. The customer walked. They did not doubt the vendor's technical competence. They doubted their ability to satisfy governance requirements. Enterprise red teaming is not just about security — it is about demonstrating that security is managed, repeatable, and auditable.

## What Enterprise Customers Expect

Enterprise customers operate under governance frameworks that require documented security processes. They expect red teaming to be a formal program, not an ad-hoc activity. When they evaluate your AI system, they ask questions like: Do you have a written red teaming methodology? How often do you conduct adversarial tests? Who performs them — internal teams or third parties? What attack vectors do you test? How do you prioritize findings? What is the average time to remediation? How do you track fixes to completion? Do you retest after remediation? These are not technical questions. They are governance questions.

The enterprise customer needs to demonstrate to their own auditors, regulators, and board that they conducted due diligence on vendor risk. If your red teaming program is informal or undocumented, you become a compliance liability. Even if your system is secure, the lack of evidence makes you unacceptable. Enterprise procurement teams have lists of required security controls. Red teaming is increasingly one of them. If you cannot produce a red team report, a methodology document, and evidence of regular testing, you do not make it past procurement.

The shift happened between 2024 and 2026 as AI adoption moved from pilot projects to production systems handling regulated data. Early AI deployments were experimental. Governance was light. By 2026, enterprise AI systems process customer records, financial transactions, healthcare data, and legal contracts at scale. Regulators, insurers, and internal audit teams now treat AI like any other critical system. That means formal red teaming is not optional.

## Governance Requirements

Governance starts with a documented methodology. Enterprise customers expect you to have a written red teaming framework that defines scope, attack categories, testing frequency, roles and responsibilities, and escalation paths. The methodology should cover prompt injection, data extraction, jailbreaking, hallucination exploitation, tool misuse, and any domain-specific risks relevant to your use case. It should specify how often testing occurs — quarterly, before major releases, after significant model changes, and when new attack techniques emerge. It should identify who conducts the tests, how findings are classified by severity, and who is accountable for remediation.

The methodology must be approved by someone with authority. In mature organizations, that means the Chief Information Security Officer or the Chief Risk Officer. The document should be versioned, updated as attack landscapes evolve, and reviewed annually. Enterprise customers will ask to see it. If you do not have it, they will assume your red teaming is improvised.

Governance also requires separation of duties. The team building the AI system should not be the only team testing it. Internal red teams must report to security leadership, not product leadership, to avoid conflicts of interest. External third-party assessments provide additional independence. Enterprise customers trust third-party red team reports more than self-assessments because the incentives are aligned — the third party is paid to find problems, not to minimize them.

## Documentation Standards

Every red team engagement must produce documentation. The minimum is a findings report that includes the date of testing, the scope of the engagement, the attack vectors tested, the vulnerabilities discovered, the severity classification of each finding, and the recommended remediation steps. Findings should be specific enough that an engineer can reproduce the attack and verify the fix. Vague descriptions like "the model is vulnerable to prompt injection" are not sufficient. The report must include the exact prompt used, the unintended behavior observed, and the conditions under which the vulnerability manifests.

Severity classifications must follow a consistent rubric. Many organizations use a five-tier system: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational. Critical findings are those that allow data exfiltration, unauthorized actions, or regulatory violations. High findings enable significant misuse but require specific conditions. Medium findings represent exploitable weaknesses with limited impact. Low findings are edge cases with minimal risk. Informational findings are observations that do not constitute vulnerabilities but may inform future improvements. The rubric should be documented and applied consistently across engagements.

Remediation tracking is part of the documentation standard. Each finding must have an assigned owner, a target remediation date, and a status field. Findings move through stages: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Verified. Verification means the red team retested the attack after the fix was deployed and confirmed the vulnerability no longer exists. Enterprise customers will ask what percentage of findings are resolved within 30 days, within 60 days, and within 90 days. If you cannot answer, your documentation is inadequate.

## Repeatability and Consistency

Enterprise red teaming must be repeatable. You cannot test your model once and call it done. Attack techniques evolve. Models change. New features introduce new attack surfaces. Enterprise customers expect regular testing on a predictable schedule. Quarterly red teaming is the emerging standard for high-risk AI systems. Annual testing is acceptable for lower-risk applications. Ad-hoc testing in response to incidents is reactive, not proactive.

Repeatability also means consistent methodology across engagements. If you test for prompt injection in one quarter but skip it the next, you cannot demonstrate consistent coverage. The test suite should be versioned. Each engagement should document which version of the test suite was used, which attack vectors were in scope, and which were deferred. If you add new tests — for example, testing for multimodal attacks when you add image input — the change should be documented and the rationale explained.

Consistency extends to the team performing the tests. If you rely on external red teams, rotating vendors every quarter makes it hard to compare results over time. Different vendors use different methodologies, different severity scales, and different reporting formats. Many enterprises standardize on one or two preferred red team vendors and maintain long-term relationships. This allows trend analysis. You can see whether vulnerabilities are decreasing over time, whether new attack classes are emerging, and whether remediation velocity is improving.

## Integration with Enterprise Risk Management

Enterprise customers expect red teaming to integrate with their broader risk management processes. They want to know how red team findings feed into vendor risk scoring, how vulnerabilities are tracked in centralized risk registers, and how red teaming outcomes affect contract renewals and SLA commitments. If your red team discovers a Critical finding, enterprise customers expect escalation procedures. Who gets notified? How quickly? What interim mitigations are applied while the fix is developed?

Integration also means aligning red teaming with incident response. If a red team discovers a vulnerability that matches an attack vector used in a real-world incident, that connection must be documented. Red teaming findings should inform the scenarios tested in tabletop exercises and simulated incident drills. Security teams use red team reports to validate detection rules, test alerting thresholds, and refine response playbooks. If red teaming is isolated from the rest of the security program, it produces reports but not resilience.

Enterprise risk teams also care about trend data. They want to see metrics like: total number of findings per engagement, percentage of Critical and High findings, average time to remediation, percentage of findings resolved before the next engagement, and year-over-year trends. These metrics help them assess whether your security posture is improving, stable, or degrading. Without trend data, red teaming is a point-in-time snapshot with no context.

## Reporting Hierarchies

Enterprise red teaming requires clear reporting lines. Findings must be escalated to the appropriate stakeholders based on severity. Critical findings go immediately to the Chief Information Security Officer, the Chief Product Officer, and the Chief Risk Officer. High findings go to security leadership and product leadership. Medium findings go to the product team and are tracked in sprint planning. Low and Informational findings are logged but do not trigger escalation.

Escalation timelines matter. Critical findings require notification within 24 hours. High findings within one week. The notification should include the finding description, the attack vector, the potential impact, the proposed remediation, and the target fix date. Enterprise customers expect to be notified if a red team discovers a vulnerability in a system they are already using. Delayed disclosure is a contract violation in many enterprise agreements.

Reporting hierarchies also apply to governance committees. Many enterprises have AI governance boards or model risk committees that review red team reports quarterly. The red team lead or the Chief Information Security Officer presents findings, remediation status, and trend data. The committee may approve changes to the red teaming methodology, allocate budget for additional testing, or require third-party assessments for high-risk systems. If your red teaming program does not produce reports suitable for board-level review, it will not satisfy enterprise governance requirements.

## Audit Trail Requirements

Enterprise customers and their auditors need an audit trail that proves red teaming occurred, findings were tracked, and remediations were verified. The audit trail includes engagement reports, remediation tickets, retest confirmations, and sign-off documentation. Every finding should have a unique identifier that links the initial discovery to the remediation task to the verification test. If an auditor asks to see evidence that a specific vulnerability was fixed, you must be able to produce the original finding, the code change or configuration update, the retest report, and the closure note.

Audit trails also cover methodology changes. If you update your red teaming framework to add new attack vectors, the change must be documented with a rationale, an effective date, and an approval signature. If you switch red team vendors, the transition must be logged. If you defer testing a particular attack vector because it is not relevant to your use case, the decision must be documented and justified. Auditors distrust gaps. If a quarter has no red team report, they ask why. If a finding appears in one report but not the next with no explanation, they flag it as unresolved.

Many enterprises use GRC platforms — governance, risk, and compliance tools like ServiceNow, Archer, or OneTrust — to centralize audit trails. Red team findings are imported into the GRC system, assigned to owners, tracked through remediation, and marked verified upon retest. The GRC platform becomes the source of truth for compliance reporting. If your red teaming process does not integrate with standard GRC platforms, enterprise customers will require manual reporting, which increases overhead and error risk.

## Building Enterprise-Ready Red Teaming Programs

An enterprise-ready red teaming program has five components. First, a documented methodology approved by security leadership and reviewed annually. Second, a regular testing schedule aligned with release cycles and regulatory requirements. Third, a findings management process with severity classification, remediation tracking, and verification testing. Fourth, integration with enterprise risk management and incident response. Fifth, clear reporting hierarchies and audit trails that satisfy auditors and governance boards.

Building this takes time. You cannot create an enterprise-ready program overnight. Start with the methodology document. Define scope, attack vectors, roles, and escalation paths. Get it approved by your Chief Information Security Officer. Then establish a cadence. If you release quarterly, schedule red teaming before each release. If you release continuously, schedule red teaming quarterly. Hire or contract a red team. If you have internal security expertise, build an internal team. If not, engage a third party. Run the first engagement. Document findings. Track remediation. Retest. Produce a report. Present it to leadership. Refine the process. Repeat.

The first few engagements will be rough. You will discover gaps in your methodology, inefficiencies in your findings tracking, and confusion about escalation. That is normal. Treat the first year as a maturity-building phase. By the fourth or fifth engagement, the process should feel repeatable. By the end of the second year, you should have trend data, a proven remediation cadence, and audit trails that satisfy enterprise buyers.

Enterprise red teaming is not a technical challenge. It is an organizational discipline. The attacks are the same whether you are a startup or a Fortune 500 company. The difference is the rigor, the documentation, the governance, and the proof. Enterprise customers pay for that proof. If you build the program, you unlock the enterprise market. If you skip it, you stay locked out.
