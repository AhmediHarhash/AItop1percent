# Chapter 13 — Enterprise Red Teaming and Compliance

Enterprise AI red teaming is not a technical exercise. It is a governance requirement. When you sell to large organizations, when you operate in regulated industries, when you handle sensitive data at scale — red teaming transforms from a best practice into a documented, repeatable, auditable program. The enterprise buyer does not care only whether your system is secure. They care whether you can prove it. They care whether your red teaming process aligns with SOC 2 controls, satisfies EU AI Act obligations, meets industry-specific regulatory standards, and produces the documentation their auditors demand. They care whether you have a formal operating model, whether you engage third parties for independent assessment, whether you understand the supply chain risks in your vector databases and API providers, and whether your board receives regular reports on adversarial testing outcomes.

This chapter covers the full landscape of enterprise red teaming and compliance. What governance structures enterprises expect. How SOC 2 audits examine AI security. What the EU AI Act requires for high-risk systems. How healthcare, finance, and legal verticals impose industry-specific red teaming obligations. When and how to engage third-party red teams. What documentation auditors need. How to report red teaming results to executives and boards. How to red team your vendors and your AI supply chain. How to test third-party embeddings, vector stores, and external APIs. What high-risk AI systems require under emerging regulations. How red teaming affects insurance and liability. How to build the enterprise red team program. And how to tie it all together into an operating model that scales.

The stakes are higher in enterprise. A missed vulnerability is not just a security incident — it is a compliance failure, a contract breach, a regulatory penalty, and a reputation crisis. Red teaming at enterprise scale is how you prove you took every reasonable step to find and fix risks before deployment.

*Enterprise red teaming is not about finding more vulnerabilities. It is about proving you looked.*
