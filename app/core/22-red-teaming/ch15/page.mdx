# Chapter 15 — AI Infrastructure and Control Plane Red Teaming

Most AI red teaming focuses on the model. Attackers who want persistent, broad, and hard-to-detect access focus on the infrastructure. The CI/CD pipeline that deploys your model. The registry that stores your weights. The prompt management system that controls your system instructions. The secrets vault that holds your API keys. The developer environment where engineers test with production data. The GPU cluster with shared tenant memory. These are the targets that traditional security teams understand and that AI security teams routinely overlook. A single compromised pipeline change affects every user across every session. A single swapped model checkpoint replaces the behavior of every deployment. A single leaked API key opens access to every model your organization hosts. These attacks are not theoretical — they are the techniques that real adversaries prefer because infrastructure compromise scales in ways that prompt injection never can.

This chapter bridges the gap between decades of infrastructure penetration testing and the new landscape of AI serving systems. You will learn how to attack and defend the systems surrounding the model — the control plane that determines what gets deployed, what instructions the model follows, what credentials it uses, and what data it can reach. Every attack pattern in this chapter has a traditional infrastructure analogue, but the AI context changes the stakes, the detection difficulty, and the blast radius. If your red teaming program tests the model but ignores the infrastructure, you are defending the vault door while leaving the loading dock wide open.

*The model is the payload. The infrastructure is the delivery mechanism. This chapter teaches you to attack both — because your adversaries already do.*
