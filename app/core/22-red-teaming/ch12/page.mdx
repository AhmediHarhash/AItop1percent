# Chapter 12 — Continuous Red Teaming

Red teaming is not a one-time event. It is a discipline. The systems you built in January have changed by March. The model provider you depend on pushed an update. Your prompt architecture evolved. Your traffic patterns shifted. Your guardrails were relaxed to improve user satisfaction. And somewhere in that drift, a new vulnerability opened.

One-time red teaming gives you a snapshot of security posture at a moment in time. Continuous red teaming gives you ongoing assurance that the defenses you built are still holding. The attacker never stops. Neither can you.

This chapter covers how to embed adversarial testing into the operational rhythm of AI product development — not as a special event, but as a continuous process that runs alongside regression testing, release pipelines, and production monitoring. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to build a sustainable red teaming practice that scales with your system and adapts to evolving threats.

*The question is not whether your defenses work today. The question is whether they will still work tomorrow.*
