# Chapter 11 — Automated Adversarial Testing

Human red teams find the creative attacks. They discover the jailbreaks that exploit model reasoning, the prompt injections that manipulate context windows, the edge cases that expose training biases. But human red teams do not scale. A team of five researchers can test hundreds of prompts per week. An automated system can test hundreds of thousands per hour. The question is not whether to automate adversarial testing — it is how to automate it without losing the creativity that makes human red teaming effective.

Automation extends coverage. It explores the vast input space that humans cannot manually traverse. It runs continuously, finding regressions the moment they appear. It generates attacks faster than defenders can patch them, creating the feedback loop that strengthens systems before deployment. But automation also has limits. It finds patterns, not insights. It discovers known attack classes, not novel exploitation strategies. The most dangerous vulnerabilities — the ones that require understanding model behavior at a conceptual level — still require human intuition.

The teams that build robust AI systems use both. Automated testing provides the baseline coverage, the continuous regression detection, the scale that keeps pace with model updates. Human red teams provide the creativity, the adversarial thinking, the ability to chain multiple small vulnerabilities into a critical exploit. This chapter covers how to build automated adversarial testing systems that complement human expertise rather than replace it.
