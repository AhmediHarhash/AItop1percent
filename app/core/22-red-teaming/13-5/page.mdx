# 13.5 — Third-Party Red Team Assessments

Your internal team has been red teaming your AI system for six months. You have found vulnerabilities, fixed them, and built a mature testing practice. Then an external security firm runs a two-week assessment and finds three critical issues your team missed. The issues are not obscure edge cases — they are exploitation paths that should have been obvious. Your internal team was too close to the system. They knew what they were trying to prevent, so they tested for those specific threats. The external team came in without assumptions and found the gaps.

Third-party red team assessments provide independent validation. They bring fresh perspectives, different attack methodologies, and no organizational blind spots. They also provide audit credibility — an internal team claiming their own system is secure carries less weight than an external team with no incentive to understate risk. Knowing when to engage external red teamers, how to scope their work, and how to integrate their findings with internal efforts is what separates mature security programs from teams that only test what they already know how to fix.

## When External Validation Becomes Necessary

Most teams start with internal red teaming. It is faster, cheaper, and you control the process. Internal teams understand the product, the codebase, and the business context. They can iterate quickly and test continuously. External assessments should not replace internal testing — they should complement it.

Engage external red teamers when you need independent validation for high-stakes deployments. If you are launching an AI system in a regulated industry, external assessment results carry more weight with regulators than internal testing alone. If you are seeking security certification or compliance attestation, third-party findings are often required. If your system handles high-risk decisions — medical diagnoses, financial approvals, legal advice — external validation reduces liability risk by demonstrating you sought expert review.

Use external teams when your internal team has plateaued. If your internal red teamers have been testing the same system for months and finding fewer new issues, that could mean the system is hardened — or it could mean your team is out of ideas. External assessors bring different techniques, different tools, and different assumptions about what is possible. They test attack vectors your team did not consider because they approach the problem with a different mental model.

External assessments are also valuable after major changes. If you fine-tuned your model on new data, migrated to a new architecture, or integrated new tool-use capabilities, an external team can evaluate whether those changes introduced new vulnerabilities. Internal teams sometimes develop blind spots around their own changes — they know what they intended to happen, so they test for intended behavior. External teams test for unintended consequences.

Finally, use external teams when you need to demonstrate independence for audits, board reviews, or customer due diligence. A customer evaluating your AI product will ask what security testing you have done. Saying "we tested it ourselves" is less convincing than "we hired a specialized red team firm and here is their report." The credibility of external validation often justifies the cost.

## Selecting Red Team Vendors

Not all red team vendors are equal. Security firms that excel at penetration testing traditional software may lack the AI-specific expertise to find prompt injection vulnerabilities, adversarial input weaknesses, or training data extraction paths. Look for vendors with proven AI red teaming experience — teams that have published research on LLM security, contributed to AI safety frameworks, or conducted assessments for other AI products in your industry.

Ask for case studies. What AI systems have they tested? What types of vulnerabilities did they find? Can they describe their methodology for testing prompt injection, jailbreaking, tool misuse, and training data leakage? A vendor that gives generic answers about "comprehensive security testing" probably lacks deep AI expertise. A vendor that can walk through specific attack chains they have exploited in other LLM deployments understands the domain.

Evaluate their team composition. AI red teaming requires both security expertise and AI domain knowledge. The best teams include security researchers who understand adversarial techniques and AI engineers who understand model behavior, training dynamics, and architecture weaknesses. If the vendor's team is entirely security-focused with no AI practitioners, they may miss vulnerabilities that require understanding how models actually work.

Check references. Talk to other companies that have used the vendor. Ask whether the findings were actionable. Ask whether the vendor understood the product context or just ran automated tools and reported every alert. Ask whether the engagement led to meaningful security improvements or produced a generic report that sat on a shelf. The value of external red teaming is measured by the vulnerabilities you fix, not the length of the report.

Consider vendor specialization. Some firms specialize in healthcare AI, others in financial AI, others in consumer applications. If your system operates in a regulated industry, a vendor with domain expertise will test for industry-specific risks that a generalist might miss. A healthcare AI vendor knows to test for HIPAA violations and clinical safety risks. A finance AI vendor knows to test for fair lending compliance and fraud bypass. Domain-specialized vendors produce findings that align with your regulatory obligations.

## Scoping the Engagement

External red team engagements require clear scope definition. You must specify what is in scope for testing, what is out of scope, what level of access the vendor will have, what timeframe they will work within, and what deliverables you expect. Ambiguous scoping leads to wasted effort, missed vulnerabilities, and frustration on both sides.

Define the system boundaries. Are you asking the vendor to test just the AI model, or the full deployment including APIs, user interfaces, data pipelines, and integrations? Are tool-use capabilities in scope? Is the vendor allowed to test whether the model can be manipulated to abuse external APIs? Is training data extraction testing in scope, or only inference-time attacks? The more precisely you define scope, the more focused the testing will be.

Specify access levels. Will the vendor have black-box access only — interacting with the system as an external user would? Or will they have gray-box access — some knowledge of architecture and internals? Or white-box access — full visibility into prompts, model weights, training data, and code? Black-box testing simulates real attacker conditions but may miss internal vulnerabilities. White-box testing finds deeper issues but requires more time and trust. Most engagements use gray-box access — the vendor gets architectural documentation and API specs but not raw model weights or production data.

Set testing constraints. Are there rate limits the vendor must respect? Are there sensitive operations they should avoid triggering in production? If the system interacts with real external services, are there financial or operational limits on what the vendor can test? If the model can generate emails or make API calls, should the vendor test those capabilities in a sandbox only? Clear constraints prevent unintended production impact while still enabling meaningful testing.

Define success criteria. What does a successful engagement look like? Are you expecting a specific number of findings? Are you focused on critical vulnerabilities only, or do you want a comprehensive catalog of all issues? Do you want proof-of-concept exploits for every finding, or just descriptions? Do you need remediation guidance, or will your internal team handle fixes? The deliverables should match your goals.

## Managing Vendor Access

External red teamers need access to your system, but that access must be controlled. You are giving a third party permission to attack your AI product — sometimes in ways that could cause harm if not properly sandboxed. Managing vendor access requires balancing their need to test realistically against your need to prevent unintended damage.

Create isolated test environments when possible. If your AI system can be deployed in a sandbox that mirrors production but does not touch real user data or real external systems, use that for external testing. This allows the vendor to test aggressively without risking production stability or triggering unintended actions. If full isolation is not possible, implement safeguards — rate limits, API call caps, restricted tool access — that prevent testing from causing operational impact.

Provide test accounts with appropriate permissions. The vendor should not use production user accounts or admin credentials unless the engagement specifically includes testing privilege escalation. Create dedicated accounts with the access levels you want tested. If you want the vendor to test what a standard user can do, give them standard user credentials. If you want them to test what a compromised employee could do, give them employee-level access in the test environment.

Monitor vendor activity. Even trusted vendors should be monitored during testing. Log all interactions from vendor test accounts. Review activity in real time or near-real time to ensure testing stays within scope. If the vendor starts testing attack vectors you did not authorize, you need to know immediately. Monitoring also provides an audit trail showing what was tested and when.

Establish communication channels. The vendor should have a direct line to your team for questions, scope clarifications, and incident reporting. If they discover a critical vulnerability that could be actively exploited, they need to escalate it immediately — not wait until the final report. Define how urgent findings should be communicated and who on your team will respond.

## Comparing Internal and External Findings

The goal of external assessment is not to replace internal red teaming but to complement it. The most valuable insight often comes from comparing what your internal team found versus what the external team found. The gaps reveal your blind spots.

If the external team finds issues your internal team tested for and missed, your internal methodology needs refinement. Perhaps your internal team is not testing aggressively enough. Perhaps they are using outdated attack techniques. Perhaps they lack tools or expertise the external team has. Use the external findings to train your internal team and update your internal test suite.

If the external team finds issues your internal team never considered, you have a perspective problem. Your internal team may be too focused on known attack classes and not exploring novel adversarial strategies. External teams often find creative exploitation chains — combining multiple small weaknesses into a critical vulnerability. These findings should expand your internal team's threat model.

If the external team finds few new issues, that is strong validation. It means your internal red teaming is comprehensive and your threat model is mature. It also means your remediation efforts are effective — you are not just finding vulnerabilities, you are fixing them. This is the outcome you want, but it still provides value. External validation gives you confidence to assert to regulators, customers, and stakeholders that your system has been independently verified.

Track how findings overlap. If both internal and external teams find the same vulnerability independently, it is high-confidence confirmation that the issue is real and exploitable. If one team finds an issue the other did not, investigate why. Was it a difference in methodology? A difference in access? A difference in how aggressively they tested certain attack vectors? Understanding why findings differ makes both internal and external testing more effective over time.

## Integration with Internal Teams

External red team engagements should not operate in isolation. The external team should collaborate with your internal security and AI teams throughout the engagement. This collaboration ensures the external team understands the product, focuses on high-value targets, and transfers knowledge to your internal team.

Start with a kickoff meeting. The external team should meet with your product, engineering, and security teams to understand the system architecture, the threat model, and the priorities. If you are most concerned about prompt injection, tell the external team. If you have specific compliance requirements, brief them on those. The external team should not work from a generic playbook — they should tailor testing to your risks.

Provide mid-engagement check-ins. Halfway through the assessment, the external team should share preliminary findings. This allows you to verify they are testing the right areas, clarify any misunderstandings, and adjust scope if needed. It also accelerates remediation — you can start fixing critical issues before the final report is delivered.

Conduct a findings debrief. When the assessment is complete, the external team should present findings to your internal team in detail. Not just a written report, but a working session where they demonstrate exploits, explain attack chains, and answer questions. This debrief is where your internal team learns the most. They see how an external expert approaches your system and what they test that internal teams overlook.

Assign internal team members to shadow the external assessment when possible. If the vendor allows it, have your internal red teamers observe their work. They learn new techniques, new tools, and new ways of thinking about adversarial testing. This knowledge transfer is one of the most valuable outcomes of external engagements — your internal team becomes more capable for future testing.

## Cost Considerations

External red team assessments are expensive. Depending on scope, they can cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. For startups and smaller teams, this is a significant investment. Understanding what drives cost and how to maximize value helps justify the expense.

Cost scales with scope. A narrow assessment focused on one attack class — like prompt injection only — costs less than a comprehensive assessment covering all attack vectors. A black-box assessment costs less than white-box because it requires less vendor time to understand your system. A one-week engagement costs less than a four-week engagement. Define the minimum scope that meets your validation goals.

Cost also scales with vendor expertise. Firms with deep AI red teaming specialization and strong reputations charge premium rates. Generalist security firms may cost less but provide less AI-specific value. The cheapest vendor is not the best choice if their findings are shallow or irrelevant. The right question is not what costs least — it is what provides the best return on security improvement per dollar spent.

Consider external assessments as recurring, not one-time. If your AI system evolves continuously, a single external assessment provides a point-in-time snapshot. Budget for annual or semi-annual external reviews to validate that new features, new models, and new integrations have not introduced new vulnerabilities. Recurring engagements also build vendor familiarity with your system — the second assessment is more efficient than the first because the vendor already understands your architecture.

For cost-constrained teams, consider narrow but frequent engagements. Instead of one comprehensive annual assessment, run quarterly focused assessments on specific attack classes or new features. This spreads cost across the year and provides more continuous validation. A quarterly two-day engagement may be more valuable than an annual two-week engagement if it keeps testing aligned with rapid product changes.

## Building Long-Term Relationships

The best external red team relationships are long-term partnerships, not transactional engagements. When the same vendor assesses your system repeatedly, they develop institutional knowledge about your architecture, your threat model, and your security posture. They know what they tested before, what you fixed, and what to focus on next. This continuity makes each engagement more efficient and more valuable.

Long-term relationships also enable deeper collaboration. A vendor you work with once delivers a report and moves on. A vendor you work with every quarter becomes an extension of your security team. They provide ongoing advice, they share threat intelligence about new attack techniques, they help you prioritize remediation. The relationship evolves from "we hired them to find bugs" to "they are our external red team partners."

Invest in relationship building. After an engagement, provide feedback to the vendor about what was valuable and what was not. Share how you used their findings and what impact remediation had. This helps the vendor improve their methodology for your next engagement. It also signals that you value the partnership and want to work together long-term.

Consider retainer arrangements if you need ongoing access. Some vendors offer retainer-based relationships where you pay for a certain number of assessment days per year and schedule them as needed. This provides flexibility to test new features on short notice and ensures the vendor has capacity reserved for your work. Retainers also often come with discounted rates compared to ad-hoc engagements.

External red team assessments are most valuable when integrated into your broader security program. The next step is ensuring that the work you do — internal and external — is documented in a way that satisfies auditors and regulators.
