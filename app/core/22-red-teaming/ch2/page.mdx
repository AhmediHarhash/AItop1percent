# Chapter 2 — The AI Attack Surface

Every AI system is a constellation of attack vectors. The user input is an attack vector. The retrieval layer is an attack vector. The tool-calling interface is an attack vector. The output formatting logic is an attack vector. The model itself is an attack vector. The difference between a secure AI system and a compromised one is not whether attack vectors exist — they always do — but whether you have systematically identified, documented, and defended every component that an adversary could exploit.

Traditional software has well-understood attack surfaces: databases, APIs, authentication layers, file systems. AI systems have all of those plus a new class of vulnerabilities that emerge from language-based interfaces, probabilistic behavior, and the fact that your system is literally designed to follow instructions from potentially untrusted sources. You cannot defend what you have not mapped. This chapter walks through every major component of an AI system from an attacker's perspective, identifying where adversaries can enter your system, what they can manipulate once inside, and what they can extract.

*The attack surface is not static — it evolves with every model update, every prompt change, every new integration — and the adversary is already probing for the gaps you have not yet discovered.*
