# Chapter 17 — Purple Teaming for AI Systems

Red teams find the holes. Blue teams patch the walls. But in most organizations, these two functions operate like ships passing in the night — the red team publishes a report in March, the blue team reads it in June, and by September the model has been updated three times and the original findings are irrelevant. This gap between offense and defense is not just an inefficiency. It is the reason that AI systems get breached by attacks that were technically "found" months earlier. Purple teaming is the discipline that closes this gap. It merges offensive testing and defensive response into a single, continuous operational practice where every attack discovered immediately becomes a detection built, tested, and deployed. For traditional software systems, purple teaming is a mature optimization. For AI systems, it is a survival requirement.

AI systems demand purple teaming because their attack surface is not static. Every model update changes which prompts succeed and which fail. Every new tool integration opens a new lateral movement path. Every retrieval source added to the RAG pipeline introduces a new indirect injection surface. A defense that worked on Tuesday can fail silently on Wednesday after a model version bump that nobody flagged to the security team. Traditional vulnerability management operates on quarterly cadences. AI security requires feedback loops that operate in days, sometimes hours. The purple team is the organizational structure that makes this speed possible — not by working harder, but by eliminating the handoff latency that kills defensive posture.

This chapter covers the full operational bridge between AI attack and defense. You will learn how to build tight feedback loops that convert red team findings into live detections within the same week. You will design SOC playbooks for AI-specific incidents that traditional security operations centers have never seen. You will integrate AI telemetry into SIEM platforms so that prompt injection, data extraction, and safety bypass leave detectable signatures. You will build detection engineering practices, calibrate automated responses, run control validation workshops, close monitoring gaps, train your team through AI-specific CTF exercises, and establish the operating model that makes all of it sustainable. By the end, your red team and blue team will not be two separate functions that exchange reports. They will be one unit that finds and fixes faster than attackers can adapt.

*Red teams create fire. Blue teams build walls. Purple teams forge the loop where every flame makes the walls stronger — and in AI systems, that loop is the only thing that keeps pace with attackers who never stop adapting.*
