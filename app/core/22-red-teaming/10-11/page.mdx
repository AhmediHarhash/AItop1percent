# 10.11 — Red Team Budgets and Timelines

How much does red teaming cost? In late 2024, a Series B healthcare startup asked this question to three external red team firms. The quotes ranged from 28,000 dollars for a one-week engagement with a two-person team to 180,000 dollars for a four-week engagement with a five-person team and comprehensive tooling. The startup had no frame of reference. They did not know whether they needed one week or four, two people or five, basic or comprehensive. They chose the cheapest option to control costs. The one-week engagement found six findings, all marked Medium or Low severity. Three months later, a security researcher publicly disclosed a Critical jailbreak vulnerability the red team had missed. The startup had optimized for cost, not coverage. The savings cost them their credibility.

Red teaming requires resources — time, people, tools, and expertise. Understanding cost structures helps you allocate appropriately and avoid both under-investment and waste. The right budget depends on your system's complexity, risk profile, regulatory requirements, and organizational maturity. A simple customer service bot with limited access to sensitive data might need a one-week engagement annually. A medical diagnosis assistant subject to FDA oversight might need quarterly engagements with specialized domain expertise. The cost difference can be ten times. Neither is wrong if it matches the risk.

## Red Team Cost Structures: What You Are Paying For

Red teaming costs break into four categories: labor, tooling, reporting, and remediation support. Labor is the largest component — typically 60 to 80 percent of the total. This includes the time red teamers spend planning the engagement, executing attacks, documenting findings, and presenting results. Rates vary by expertise. A generalist security consultant might charge 150 to 250 dollars per hour. A specialist with deep AI red teaming experience and a track record of high-impact findings might charge 300 to 500 dollars per hour. A team of five specialists working for two weeks at 400 dollars per hour costs 160,000 dollars in labor alone.

Tooling costs include access to commercial red teaming platforms, adversarial testing frameworks, fuzzing tools, and infrastructure for running attacks at scale. Some tools are open-source and free. Others are enterprise-licensed and cost thousands of dollars per month. If the red team needs to deploy infrastructure — such as cloud compute for brute-force testing or test environments that mirror production — those costs add up quickly. A comprehensive four-week engagement might spend 10,000 to 20,000 dollars on tooling and infrastructure.

Reporting costs are usually bundled into labor, but they are worth isolating conceptually. A detailed red team report takes significant time to write. Expect one to two days of effort per week of testing for high-quality documentation. If the engagement includes a formal readout meeting, executive briefings, or training sessions for your engineering team, that is additional labor. Some firms charge separately for these deliverables. Others include them in a fixed engagement fee.

Remediation support is optional but valuable. Some red teams provide limited follow-up — they will answer questions about findings for 30 days post-engagement at no additional cost. Others offer paid remediation support, where they consult with your engineering team on fix design, retest fixes as they are deployed, or run a follow-up engagement three months later to verify that all findings were addressed. Budgeting for remediation support ensures you have access to the people who found the vulnerabilities when you need help closing them.

## Internal Versus External: Cost Comparison

Building an internal red team costs more upfront but less over time. Hiring one senior AI security engineer at 180,000 dollars per year base salary costs roughly 250,000 dollars annually with benefits, equipment, and overhead. That person can run multiple engagements per year, provide ongoing adversarial testing, train other engineers, and build institutional knowledge. Over three years, that is 750,000 dollars for continuous capability. Three external engagements per year at 80,000 dollars each costs 240,000 dollars annually, or 720,000 dollars over three years. The costs are similar, but the value is different.

External red teams bring fresh perspective, specialized expertise, and no organizational bias. They are not invested in your architecture, your team, or your product decisions. They will tell you things your internal team might hesitate to say. They also bring experience from dozens of other organizations, which means they have seen attack patterns and failure modes you have not. If you run one or two engagements per year, external red teams are cost-effective and bring high value per dollar spent.

Internal red teams bring continuity, context, and speed. They understand your system deeply because they work with it daily. They can run lightweight adversarial tests continuously instead of waiting for a scheduled engagement. They can collaborate closely with product and engineering to design security into new features before launch. They also cost less per engagement hour because you are not paying external consulting rates. If you need red teaming more than twice per year, or if your system changes rapidly and requires frequent testing, internal capability is more cost-effective long-term.

Many organizations use a hybrid model. They build a small internal red team — one or two people — who handle continuous adversarial testing, lightweight engagements, and collaboration with engineering. They bring in external red teams annually or when launching high-risk features to get an independent perspective and access to specialized expertise. This model balances cost, coverage, and independence. The internal team provides baseline security. The external team provides validation and discovers what the internal team missed.

## Time Allocation: Where the Hours Go

A two-week red team engagement involves roughly 160 hours of labor from a two-person team. How those hours are spent determines what you get. Scoping and planning take 10 to 15 percent — understanding the system, defining objectives, setting up test environments, and aligning on rules of engagement. Reconnaissance and mapping take another 10 to 15 percent — exploring the system's attack surface, identifying components, and building a mental model of how it works.

Active testing takes 50 to 60 percent — executing attacks, fuzzing inputs, testing jailbreaks, probing for data leaks, attempting policy violations, and iterating on failed attempts. This is the core work. The percentage varies by engagement type. A focused engagement targeting one specific risk might spend 70 percent on active testing. A broad engagement covering multiple risk categories spends more time on reconnaissance and less on deep exploitation of any single vulnerability.

Documentation and reporting take 15 to 20 percent — writing findings, categorizing them by severity, drafting remediation recommendations, creating visual summaries, and preparing the final report. This percentage increases if the engagement includes formal presentations or training deliverables. A two-week engagement might produce a 25-page report. That report represents 20 to 30 hours of writing, editing, and review.

Remediation support, if included, happens after the engagement formally ends but is often budgeted as part of the total cost. Expect 5 to 10 percent of the total engagement hours to be reserved for post-engagement questions, clarifications, and retest support. If the engagement found 15 findings and the team wants help prioritizing fixes or validating approaches, that consultation time is valuable and should be planned for.

## ROI Measurement: Justifying the Investment

Red teaming is a cost center. It does not generate revenue. It prevents loss. Measuring ROI requires estimating what you avoided by finding vulnerabilities before attackers or regulators did. This is inherently speculative, but it is also necessary. Leadership will ask whether the 120,000 dollars spent on red teaming was worth it. You need an answer.

One approach is incident cost modeling. Estimate the cost of a security incident involving the vulnerabilities the red team found. If the red team discovered a prompt injection vulnerability that could expose customer PII, estimate the cost of a data breach: regulatory fines, legal fees, customer notification, credit monitoring, reputation damage, and customer churn. For a GDPR-covered organization, a breach exposing 10,000 customer records might cost 500,000 to 2 million dollars depending on severity and regulatory response. If red teaming found and fixed that vulnerability before it was exploited, the ROI is clear. You spent 120,000 dollars to avoid a potential 500,000 dollar loss.

Another approach is comparative benchmarking. Research industry incident costs and apply them to your findings. The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, published annually, provides average costs per breached record, average total breach costs, and cost breakdowns by industry. If your red team found vulnerabilities that could lead to a breach, use industry averages to model the avoided cost. This is less precise than incident-specific modeling but more defensible because it relies on published research rather than internal estimates.

A third approach is regulatory compliance value. If your system is subject to regulatory requirements that mandate security testing — such as the EU AI Act's Article 15 accuracy and robustness requirements, or FDA guidelines for medical AI — red teaming is not optional. The ROI is avoiding non-compliance penalties and enabling market access. The EU AI Act imposes fines up to 35 million euros or seven percent of global annual turnover for high-risk AI systems that fail to meet safety requirements. Red teaming that ensures compliance is worth far more than its direct cost.

Track findings severity distribution and remediation rates. If 80 percent of Critical and High findings are fixed within 60 days, that is evidence that red teaming drives measurable risk reduction. If findings sit unaddressed for months, the ROI is lower because the risk is not actually mitigated. Use this data to justify future investments and to hold teams accountable for remediation.

## Budget Optimization: Getting More Value per Dollar

Red teaming budgets are not infinite. Optimizing means maximizing coverage and impact within your constraints. One optimization is targeting. Do not red team your entire AI portfolio at once. Prioritize high-risk systems — those that handle regulated data, make automated decisions with significant user impact, or face adversarial threat actors. A two-week engagement focused on your highest-risk model will find more critical issues than a one-week engagement spread across four lower-risk models.

Another optimization is sequencing. Run a broad initial engagement to map the attack surface and identify categories of risk. Then run focused follow-up engagements targeting the highest-severity findings or the areas where the initial engagement had limited time. A broad two-week engagement might find 20 findings across five risk categories. A focused one-week follow-up targeting the two most severe categories will go deeper and find the issues the initial engagement missed. This two-phase approach costs less than a single four-week engagement and often delivers better coverage.

Leverage internal resources. Your engineering team knows the system better than any external red team will after two weeks. Have them perform internal adversarial testing using red team techniques before bringing in external experts. The internal team will find the obvious issues. The external team can then spend their time on harder, more subtle vulnerabilities. This division of labor reduces the external engagement cost and improves overall coverage.

Invest in reusable infrastructure. If you run red team engagements regularly, build shared test environments, maintain libraries of adversarial test cases, and develop internal tooling that automates common attacks. This upfront investment reduces the per-engagement cost over time. An internal red team that has a library of 5,000 adversarial prompts and automated fuzzing scripts can run a one-week engagement that would take an external team two weeks. The initial investment in building that library pays for itself within three engagements.

## Annual Versus Project-Based Budgeting

Some organizations budget for red teaming annually — allocating a fixed amount each year for scheduled engagements. Others budget project-by-project — funding red teaming when launching a new model, entering a new regulatory jurisdiction, or responding to an incident. Both approaches work, but they create different incentives and coverage patterns.

Annual budgeting ensures consistent investment and makes red teaming a predictable part of the security calendar. Teams know that a red team engagement happens every quarter or every six months, so they plan accordingly. This regularity creates accountability. It also spreads cost evenly across the fiscal year. The downside is rigidity. If a high-risk feature launches mid-year and the next scheduled engagement is not for three months, you either skip red teaming or request additional budget outside the plan.

Project-based budgeting is flexible. You red team when it makes sense — before a major launch, after a significant architecture change, or when threat intelligence indicates new adversarial activity. This ensures red teaming is targeted to actual risk. The downside is inconsistency. If projects are delayed or budgets tighten, red teaming gets deferred. Systems that have not changed recently might not get tested for a year or more, even though new attack techniques emerge continuously.

The best approach is hybrid. Budget for a baseline annual engagement — at minimum, one comprehensive red team per year for each high-risk system. Then maintain a project-based reserve for ad-hoc testing tied to launches, incidents, or regulatory changes. This ensures continuous coverage while allowing flexibility for high-priority needs.

## Scaling Red Team Investment with Organizational Growth

Red teaming costs scale with system complexity and organizational maturity. A startup with one model and 10,000 users might spend 40,000 dollars per year on red teaming — two external engagements and some internal adversarial testing. A mid-size company with five models and 500,000 users might spend 200,000 dollars per year — a small internal red team and quarterly external engagements. An enterprise with dozens of models, millions of users, and regulatory obligations across multiple jurisdictions might spend 1 to 3 million dollars per year on red teaming, threat modeling, and adversarial research.

Scale investment in stages. At early stage, rely on external red teams and lightweight internal testing. At growth stage, hire your first internal red team member and increase external engagement frequency. At enterprise scale, build a full internal red team with specialists in different attack categories and use external red teams for independent validation. Do not try to build enterprise-scale capability before you need it. Do not under-invest once you do.

Track red team spending as a percentage of overall security budget and as a percentage of AI development investment. Industry benchmarks suggest that organizations serious about AI security spend 5 to 10 percent of their AI R&D budget on evaluation, testing, and red teaming combined. If your AI team is spending 5 million dollars per year on model development and you are spending 50,000 dollars on red teaming, you are under-investing. If you are spending 500,000 dollars on a system with limited user impact and low regulatory risk, you may be over-investing. Benchmark against peers in your industry and adjust.

## Defending Red Team Budget to Leadership

Leadership will question red team costs, especially if no major incidents have occurred recently. The lack of incidents is precisely the point — red teaming prevents them — but that is a hard sell. You need a compelling narrative backed by data.

Start with risk quantification. Present the severity distribution from your most recent red team engagement. "Our last engagement found three Critical and seven High severity vulnerabilities. If exploited, these could have exposed 50,000 customer records and triggered GDPR fines starting at 500,000 euros. We spent 80,000 dollars to find and fix them before an attacker did." This frames the cost as insurance with a clear value proposition.

Use industry incidents. Reference public AI security failures — data leaks, jailbreaks that went viral, chatbot liability cases, compliance violations. "Air Canada's chatbot created a legally binding commitment the company had to honor, costing them tens of thousands of dollars in refunds and reputational damage. Our red teaming ensures we catch these issues before they reach production." External examples make the risk tangible and relatable.

Show remediation velocity. "Last year we found 24 high-severity findings. 22 were fixed within 60 days. Red teaming is not just finding problems — it is driving measurable risk reduction." This demonstrates that the investment leads to action, not just reports.

Position red teaming as a competitive advantage. "Our customers and partners ask whether we conduct adversarial testing. Having a formal red team program gives us a differentiated security story in enterprise sales." If red teaming enables revenue or reduces sales cycle friction, that is ROI leadership understands.

Finally, tie red teaming to regulatory compliance. "The EU AI Act requires high-risk AI systems to undergo robustness and accuracy testing. Red teaming is how we demonstrate compliance. Without it, we cannot operate in the EU market." Compliance-driven budgets are easier to defend because the alternative is market exclusion.

Red teaming is an investment in resilience. The cost is visible. The value is in the incidents that never happen, the vulnerabilities that never reach production, and the trust that your system is secure because someone tried to break it and failed. That confidence is worth far more than the invoice.

Next, we will cover building internal red team capability: how to hire, train, equip, and organize a red team that becomes a permanent part of your security culture, not just an occasional consultant engagement.
