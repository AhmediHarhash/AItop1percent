# 13.13 — Insurance and Liability Implications

Why do cyber insurance applications now ask about AI red teaming? Because insurers learned an expensive lesson in 2024 and 2025. Multiple AI-related claims hit the market — the Air Canada chatbot liability case, several discrimination lawsuits against hiring algorithms, and at least three major AI-driven privacy breaches that triggered regulatory fines. Insurers paid out. Then they changed their underwriting criteria. By mid-2025, major carriers began requiring evidence of adversarial testing for AI-exposed policies. By early 2026, some are excluding AI-related claims entirely unless you can prove systematic red teaming.

Your insurance coverage and your red teaming program are now connected. Insurers treat AI security the way they treat traditional cybersecurity: inadequate controls mean higher premiums or denied coverage. Comprehensive controls mean better terms. The evidence you collect through red teaming directly affects your insurability.

## The AI Liability Landscape

AI liability is evolving faster than most legal frameworks can track. Traditional product liability focuses on manufacturing defects and design flaws. AI systems introduce a new category: emergent behavior that neither the developer nor the deployer fully predicted. When an AI system causes harm through unexpected behavior, who carries the liability?

The answer depends on jurisdiction, but the trend is clear: liability is expanding. The EU AI Act creates strict liability for high-risk AI systems. The UK is considering similar frameworks. US courts are developing AI liability precedent through discrimination cases, negligence claims, and contract disputes. In every jurisdiction, the question is not whether AI creates liability exposure, but how much and under what conditions.

Discrimination claims are the most common exposure. If your hiring algorithm screens out protected groups at disproportionate rates, you face employment discrimination liability even if the bias was unintentional. If your credit underwriting model denies loans based on proxies for race, you face fair lending violations. The legal standard is impact, not intent. Your lack of awareness is not a defense.

Privacy violations create regulatory and civil exposure. If your AI system memorizes and regurgitates training data that includes personal information, you have a GDPR breach or a CCPA violation. If your chatbot leaks one customer's data to another customer, you have a negligence claim and a regulatory filing obligation. Red teaming that discovers these vulnerabilities before production significantly reduces your exposure.

Safety-critical failures in medical, automotive, or industrial AI create product liability claims. If your medical diagnostic AI misses a condition that a reasonable physician would catch, you face malpractice liability. If your autonomous vehicle control system fails in a predictable edge case, you face wrongful death claims. Demonstrating that you tested these failure modes through red teaming becomes key evidence in your defense.

## Cyber Insurance and AI

Cyber insurance policies were not written with AI in mind. Most policies cover traditional cyber risks: data breaches, ransomware, business interruption from attacks, and regulatory fines from security failures. AI creates scenarios that test the boundaries of these definitions.

Is an AI model extraction attack a data breach? Some insurers say yes because intellectual property was stolen. Others say no because no personal data was compromised. Is a prompt injection attack that causes business logic failures covered under cyber extortion? It depends on the policy language and the insurer's interpretation. Is catastrophic forgetting that causes service degradation covered under business interruption? Probably not unless you can prove it resulted from a cyber attack.

Policy exclusions are expanding. Many insurers now exclude claims arising from algorithmic decision-making unless you purchased a specific AI endorsement. Some exclude claims related to model training data unless you can prove data provenance. Some exclude claims from open-source model usage unless you can demonstrate security controls. Read your exclusions carefully. The coverage you thought you had may not apply to AI scenarios.

Underwriting requirements are tightening. Insurers increasingly require AI-specific security questionnaires. They ask about model provenance, data governance, testing procedures, and deployment controls. Red teaming evidence is becoming a standard underwriting input. If you cannot demonstrate regular adversarial testing, you will see higher premiums or coverage limitations.

## What Insurers Want to See

Insurers evaluate AI risk through a cybersecurity lens: controls reduce risk, evidence demonstrates controls, and claims history predicts future claims. Your red teaming program must produce evidence that satisfies underwriting criteria.

Documented testing methodology shows you have a systematic approach. Insurers want to see written procedures, defined scope, clear acceptance criteria, and regular cadence. Ad hoc testing demonstrates awareness. Systematic testing demonstrates control. Underwriters differentiate between the two.

Test coverage breadth matters. Insurers want evidence that you test the failure modes most likely to create claims: bias and discrimination, privacy leakage, safety-critical failures, and adversarial manipulation. If your testing focuses exclusively on prompt injection but ignores fairness, the underwriter sees a gap. Comprehensive testing reduces perceived risk.

Remediation tracking shows you fix what you find. Insurers care less about finding vulnerabilities than about closing them. If your red team reports show dozens of open high-severity findings from six months ago, the underwriter sees uncontrolled risk. If your reports show rapid remediation with documented verification, the underwriter sees good risk management.

Independent validation adds credibility. Internal testing is better than no testing. Third-party testing is better than internal testing. Insurers trust external verification more than self-assessment. If you can provide reports from independent red team engagements, your underwriting evaluation improves.

## Red Teaming as Risk Mitigation Evidence

When an AI-related claim occurs, your red teaming records become litigation evidence. If you tested for the failure mode that caused the claim and fixed what you found, you demonstrate reasonable care. If you never tested for it, you demonstrate negligence. If you found it but did not fix it, you demonstrate reckless disregard.

Consider a discrimination lawsuit against your hiring algorithm. The plaintiff's expert claims your model screens out women at twice the rate it screens out men for equivalent qualifications. Your defense depends on whether you tested for this. If your red team reports show quarterly fairness testing across protected characteristics, documented findings, and verified fixes, you have evidence of due diligence. If you have no testing records, you have no defense.

Consider a privacy breach where your chatbot leaked customer data. Regulators want to know whether you tested for prompt injection and data exfiltration attacks. If your red team identified similar vulnerabilities three months before the breach and you remediated them, you show good faith effort. If you never tested, the regulator assumes negligence and the fine increases.

Consider a safety failure in a medical AI system. A patient was harmed because the system failed in a predictable edge case. Your red team tested edge case robustness six weeks before the incident and documented three similar failure modes. You fixed two but accepted the third as low-risk based on clinical review. That documented risk acceptance becomes critical evidence. You knew the risk, assessed it, and made a deliberate decision. That is not negligence — that is risk management.

## Policy Exclusions for AI

Insurers manage AI risk through exclusions and sub-limits. Understanding what is not covered is as important as understanding what is covered.

Algorithmic decision-making exclusions deny coverage for claims arising from automated decisions unless you purchased specific AI coverage. This can exclude discrimination claims, wrongful denial claims, and negligence claims related to AI outputs. If your policy has this exclusion and you deploy AI decisioning systems, you are self-insuring that risk.

Data quality exclusions deny coverage for claims arising from inaccurate, biased, or contaminated training data. If your model was trained on scraped internet data and a copyright claim emerges, the exclusion may apply. If your model memorized PII from training data and a privacy regulator fines you, the exclusion may apply. Data provenance and quality controls become underwriting factors.

Open-source model exclusions deny coverage for claims related to models you did not develop in-house unless you can prove security and compliance controls. Using Claude, GPT-5, or Llama 4 may require specific attestations about access controls, monitoring, and testing. Using an unknown open-source model from Hugging Face may void coverage entirely.

Intentional act exclusions can apply if the insurer believes you knowingly deployed a flawed system. If your red team documented a critical vulnerability and you deployed anyway without remediation or documented risk acceptance, the insurer may deny coverage on the grounds that the resulting harm was foreseeable and intentional.

## Building Insurability

Insurability is not just about buying a policy. It is about maintaining the risk profile that makes coverage available and affordable. Your red teaming program directly contributes to insurability.

Establish testing as a regular control. Insurers prefer scheduled, predictable testing over reactive, incident-driven testing. Quarterly red team cycles for high-risk systems demonstrate ongoing vigilance. Annual cycles may be sufficient for lower-risk systems. The key is consistency.

Document everything for underwriting review. Maintain testing records, remediation tracking, and risk acceptance decisions in a format that an underwriter can evaluate. When renewal time comes, you need evidence that your controls are mature and effective. Good documentation makes underwriting faster and more favorable.

Engage underwriters early when deploying new AI capabilities. Do not wait until renewal to disclose that you launched an AI-powered credit decisioning system. Inform your broker and underwriter when material AI deployments occur. Mid-term endorsements are easier to negotiate than post-incident coverage disputes.

Invest in controls that insurers recognize. Insurers understand red teaming, model governance, access controls, and monitoring. They are less familiar with novel AI-specific controls. Frame your security measures in language underwriters understand: "We conduct quarterly penetration testing of our AI systems" is clearer than "We perform periodic adversarial robustness assessments."

## The Evolving Insurance Market

AI insurance is in early-stage development. Dedicated AI liability products are emerging but not yet mature. Coverage terms, exclusions, and pricing are changing rapidly as insurers accumulate claims data and refine risk models.

Expect continued underwriting tightening. As AI-related claims increase, insurers will demand more evidence, add more exclusions, and price risk more precisely. The gap between well-controlled AI deployments and poorly-controlled deployments will widen in premium terms.

Expect new product offerings. Cyber insurance will increasingly separate traditional cyber risks from AI-specific risks. Dedicated AI liability policies will cover algorithmic discrimination, model failures, and IP infringement. Pollution-style policies may emerge for gradual AI harms like systematic bias.

Expect regulatory intersection. As the EU AI Act enforcement ramps up and other jurisdictions adopt similar frameworks, insurers will align underwriting requirements with regulatory compliance standards. Demonstrating regulatory compliance will become table stakes for coverage. Red teaming aligned with regulatory expectations will become an underwriting prerequisite.

Your red teaming program is not just an engineering control. It is a risk management tool that affects your legal exposure, your insurance coverage, and your financial resilience. The evidence you collect, the documentation you maintain, and the remediation you complete all contribute to your defensive posture when things go wrong.

Insurers are watching how you test AI systems. Regulators are watching. Plaintiffs' attorneys are watching. The best defense is evidence that you looked for problems, found them, and fixed them before they caused harm. Red teaming provides that evidence — if you do it right.
