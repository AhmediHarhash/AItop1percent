# 14.10 — Mapping Findings to MITRE ATLAS — Standardized Attack Documentation

Why do red team findings so often die in a slide deck? Because every team invents its own vocabulary. One team calls it "prompt manipulation." Another calls it "input override." A third calls it "instruction hijacking." All three are describing the same technique, but when their findings land on the same CISO's desk, they look like three different problems requiring three different mitigations. The absence of a shared taxonomy is not a documentation inconvenience. It is an intelligence failure that prevents organizations from learning across engagements, comparing coverage across teams, and building cumulative defenses against known attack patterns. MITRE ATLAS exists to solve exactly this problem.

## What ATLAS Is and Why It Matters

ATLAS — the Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems — is MITRE's knowledge base of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures specific to AI and machine learning systems. If you have worked in traditional cybersecurity, ATLAS is to AI what ATT and CK is to enterprise infrastructure: a structured matrix that catalogs how attackers operate, organized by tactical objective and specific technique. As of the October 2025 update, ATLAS catalogs fifteen tactics and sixty-six techniques across forty-six sub-techniques, covering the full lifecycle from reconnaissance through impact.

The framework matters for red teaming because it provides three things no ad-hoc reporting can deliver. First, a common language that ensures the same attack is described the same way regardless of who discovered it. Second, a coverage map that shows which techniques your testing has addressed and which gaps remain. Third, a bridge to the broader security community, enabling you to consume threat intelligence published in ATLAS terms and contribute your own findings back to the collective knowledge base.

## How ATLAS Relates to ATT and CK

If your security team already uses ATT and CK for traditional threat modeling, understanding how ATLAS fits alongside it is essential. ATT and CK covers adversarial behavior against enterprise IT infrastructure — network intrusion, endpoint compromise, lateral movement through Active Directory, data exfiltration through conventional channels. ATLAS covers adversarial behavior against AI and machine learning systems specifically — model manipulation, training data poisoning, adversarial input crafting, and the exploitation patterns unique to systems that learn from data and generate outputs.

The two frameworks overlap at the infrastructure layer. An attacker who compromises your model serving infrastructure through a supply chain vulnerability might use ATT and CK techniques to gain initial access to the cloud environment and ATLAS techniques to manipulate the model once they are inside. Your finding report should reference both frameworks, mapping each phase to whichever taxonomy is most specific to the technique used. MITRE designed ATLAS to complement ATT and CK, not replace it. Approximately seventy percent of ATLAS mitigations map to existing security controls documented in ATT and CK, meaning that organizations with mature ATT and CK programs already have significant coverage — they just need to identify the thirty percent of AI-specific mitigations they are missing.

## The ATLAS Matrix Structure

ATLAS organizes attacks along two dimensions: tactics and techniques. Tactics represent the attacker's objectives at each phase of an operation — what they are trying to accomplish. Techniques represent the specific methods used to achieve each tactical objective — how they accomplish it. This mirrors the ATT and CK structure that most security teams already understand, which makes adoption significantly easier for organizations with mature security programs.

The tactical categories span the full attack lifecycle. Reconnaissance covers how attackers gather information about AI systems, including model architecture discovery, training data inference, and capability probing. Resource Development covers how attackers prepare their tools and infrastructure. Initial Access covers the techniques for gaining an initial foothold. Execution covers how adversarial inputs are delivered to the model. Persistence, as covered extensively in the previous subchapters, covers how attackers maintain their position. The lifecycle continues through Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact — each populated with techniques specific to AI systems rather than general IT infrastructure.

The October 2025 update was particularly significant for agentic AI security. MITRE collaborated with Zenity Labs to add fourteen new techniques specifically addressing autonomous AI agent risks, including memory manipulation, tool misuse, and multi-agent exploitation patterns. If your organization deploys agents with tool access, these additions are directly relevant to your red team program and should be incorporated into your testing coverage matrix immediately.

## Documenting Findings with ATLAS Technique IDs

When your red team discovers a vulnerability, documenting it with ATLAS technique IDs transforms a one-off finding into a piece of reusable intelligence. Instead of writing "we were able to inject instructions through the retrieval context," you document the finding as an instance of the ATLAS technique for indirect prompt injection through RAG poisoning, reference the specific technique identifier, and describe the variant you discovered. This documentation allows anyone familiar with ATLAS to immediately understand the attack class, known mitigations, and related techniques that may also apply.

A practical mapping exercise starts with the kill chain you executed. For each phase of the attack, identify the tactic that describes your objective and the technique that describes your method. If your red team conducted reconnaissance by probing the model's response patterns to infer its architecture, that maps to the ATLAS reconnaissance tactic and the relevant technique for model discovery. If you then crafted an adversarial input that bypassed the safety filter, that maps to the defense evasion tactic. If the bypass allowed you to extract training data, that maps to the exfiltration tactic with the appropriate data extraction technique.

The discipline of mapping every finding forces precision. Vague findings like "the model can be manipulated" become specific findings like "technique AML.T0051 — LLM Prompt Injection, direct variant, achieved through system prompt override with role-play framing, resulting in safety bypass and information disclosure." The specific finding is actionable. The vague finding is not.

## Practical Mapping — A Kill Chain Example

Consider a multi-stage attack against a customer service agent. The red team first probes the agent's capabilities by asking it to describe its available tools and access permissions. This maps to the ATLAS reconnaissance tactic. The team then crafts a prompt injection that convinces the agent to treat the attacker as an administrator, mapping to the initial access tactic. The injection persists in the agent's memory layer, mapping to the persistence tactic. The attacker uses the elevated access to query customer records through the agent's database tool, mapping to the collection tactic. Finally, the attacker instructs the agent to email the collected records to an external address, mapping to the exfiltration tactic.

Each phase gets a technique ID, a description of the specific variant observed, the evidence collected, and the detection or mitigation recommendations. The complete mapping tells a story that any security professional can follow, regardless of whether they were present during the test. It also reveals the dependencies between phases: if you can block the initial reconnaissance, the entire kill chain collapses. If you can detect the persistence, you catch the attack before exfiltration. ATLAS mapping does not just document what happened. It illuminates where to invest in defense.

## Coverage Analysis — Finding What You Have Not Tested

One of the highest-value uses of ATLAS in a red team program is coverage analysis. Take the full ATLAS matrix and mark which techniques your team has tested in the past twelve months. The unmarked cells are your blind spots. This exercise almost always reveals uncomfortable gaps — techniques that are well-documented in the threat landscape but have never been validated against your specific system.

Coverage analysis is especially important for emerging technique categories. The fourteen agentic AI techniques added in October 2025 represent attack patterns that most red team programs have not yet incorporated. If your organization deploys AI agents, and your coverage matrix shows no testing against memory manipulation, tool chain exploitation, or multi-agent lateral movement, you have a known gap that should drive your next engagement's scope.

The coverage map also enables informed conversations with leadership. Instead of "we need more red team budget," you present "our testing covers forty-two of sixty-six ATLAS techniques, the twenty-four untested techniques include seven that are rated high-relevance for our architecture, and addressing those gaps requires three additional engagement days per quarter." Specific coverage data converts security requests into business cases.

Build your coverage analysis as a living artifact, not a one-time exercise. After every engagement, update the matrix with the techniques tested, the results, and the date. Over six to twelve months, the matrix reveals patterns: techniques that consistently fail, techniques that consistently pass, and techniques that have never been tested at all. The consistently passing techniques can be tested less frequently. The consistently failing techniques need root-cause analysis and sustained remediation effort. The never-tested techniques need to be prioritized into the next engagement scope before they become the blind spot that an actual attacker exploits.

## Threat Intelligence Sharing Through ATLAS

When your findings are documented in ATLAS terms, they become shareable intelligence. Industry ISACs — Information Sharing and Analysis Centers — increasingly accept and distribute AI threat intelligence using ATLAS technique identifiers. If your red team discovers a novel prompt injection variant that bypasses a widely-deployed safety filter, documenting it with the appropriate ATLAS technique ID and sharing it through your ISAC enables every organization in your sector to test for the same vulnerability. The attacker who developed the technique does not limit themselves to one target. Your intelligence sharing should not limit itself to one organization.

Even within a single company, ATLAS-standardized findings enable knowledge transfer across teams. The red team that tests the customer service agent and the red team that tests the internal code assistant are likely discovering overlapping vulnerability patterns. Without standardized documentation, each team maintains their own notes in their own format, and the overlap is invisible. With ATLAS mapping, a simple query across the finding database reveals that both teams independently discovered the same defense evasion technique — which means the mitigation needs to be applied system-wide, not just to the specific agent where it was first found.

## Limitations of ATLAS and Where It Needs Extension

ATLAS is the best framework available for AI attack taxonomy, but it is not complete. The framework lags behind the pace of real-world attacks, particularly in multi-modal systems, voice and real-time AI, and complex multi-agent architectures. If your red team discovers a technique that does not cleanly map to an existing ATLAS entry, document it with the closest approximation and note the gap. Submit the novel technique to the ATLAS community for potential inclusion — this is how the framework evolves.

Another limitation is granularity. ATLAS techniques describe categories of attacks, not specific implementations. Two prompt injection variants that exploit fundamentally different mechanisms might both map to the same technique ID. Your internal documentation should add a sub-classification layer that captures the specific variant, the model family it targets, and the conditions required for success. Use ATLAS as the shared taxonomy for external communication, but maintain your own internal knowledge base with the implementation detail that ATLAS abstracts away.

Cross-framework mapping is also essential. ATLAS does not exist in isolation. Your findings may span traditional infrastructure vulnerabilities covered by ATT and CK, web application vulnerabilities covered by OWASP, and AI-specific vulnerabilities covered by ATLAS. A comprehensive finding report maps to all applicable frameworks, enabling every security team in your organization — not just the AI security team — to understand and act on the results.

## Integrating ATLAS into Your Red Team Workflow

Make ATLAS mapping a standard deliverable for every engagement, not an afterthought. The easiest way to ensure compliance is to build ATLAS fields into your finding template: technique ID, tactic category, variant description, and cross-references to related techniques. When red teamers document findings in real-time during an engagement, ATLAS mapping happens naturally as part of the workflow rather than as a post-engagement burden that gets deprioritized.

Train your red team on ATLAS the same way traditional penetration testers learn ATT and CK. Run table-top exercises where the team maps historical findings to ATLAS techniques. Review new ATLAS releases quarterly and assess which additions are relevant to your threat model. Over time, thinking in ATLAS terms becomes second nature, and your findings automatically carry the standardized documentation that enables cross-organizational learning.

ATLAS provides the taxonomy for how attacks work. But red teams also need a prioritized checklist of what to test — a practitioner-focused list of the most critical risk categories that every LLM engagement should cover. That is exactly the role the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications was designed to fill.
