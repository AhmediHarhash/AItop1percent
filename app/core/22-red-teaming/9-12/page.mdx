# 9.12 — The Line Between Helpful and Harmful

Why do most AI safety failures happen at the boundary, not the extremes? Because the extremes are easy. No one debates whether an AI should generate instructions for building bioweapons. The answer is no. No one debates whether an AI should help a user write an email. The answer is yes. The hard decisions happen in the middle. Should an AI help a user write a breakup message? A resignation letter? A complaint to their employer about discrimination? These requests are legitimate. They're also potentially harmful depending on context, execution, and user intent. Red teams spend more time navigating this boundary than fighting clear-cut violations.

The line between helpful and harmful is not a line. It's a blurry region where context determines outcomes. The same capability that helps one user harms another. The same output that's constructive in one scenario is destructive in another. Red teaming this space means understanding dual-use, building context-aware judgment, and accepting that some decisions have no clean answer.

## The Dual-Use Dilemma

Every powerful AI capability is dual-use. Persuasion helps teachers explain concepts and helps scammers defraud elderly users. Code generation helps developers build software and helps attackers write exploits. Text summarization helps researchers process literature and helps students cheat on assignments. The capability itself is neutral. The intent and context create the harm.

A legal research AI helps attorneys prepare cases. It also helps pro se litigants without legal training file motions that have no chance of success, wasting court time and their own money. The AI didn't do anything wrong. It responded to a user request for legal information. The harm is that the user lacked the context to use that information effectively. Should the AI refuse to help non-attorneys? That denies access to legal information for people who can't afford lawyers. Should it help everyone? That enables harmful self-representation. The boundary is context-dependent and there's no universally correct answer.

A chemistry AI helps students learn reaction mechanisms. It also answers questions about synthesizing controlled substances. "Explain the Birch reduction" is a legitimate educational request. The Birch reduction is also a step in synthesizing methamphetamine. Does the AI refuse to explain a fundamental organic chemistry reaction because it has a dual use? If it refuses, it breaks chemistry education. If it complies, it enables drug synthesis. You can add context detection: refuse if the user asks about drug synthesis explicitly, comply if the request is educational. Adversarial users will frame drug synthesis as educational. The line keeps moving.

A persuasive writing AI helps users craft clear, compelling arguments. It also helps users manipulate others. "Help me write an email that convinces my boss to approve this project" is a request for persuasion. "Help me write an email that convinces my ex-partner to get back together despite their stated boundaries" is a request for manipulation. Both are persuasion requests. The first is professional. The second is coercive. The AI sees the same pattern: user wants to change someone's mind. Intent differentiates help from harm, and intent is invisible to the model.

Dual-use is unavoidable in capable systems. The question is how you navigate it. Do you restrict capabilities to eliminate dual-use risk, sacrificing utility? Do you maximize utility and accept dual-use harm? Do you try to detect intent and context-switch enforcement, knowing that detection is imperfect? Every choice trades one risk for another.

## Context-Dependent Harm

The same output can be helpful or harmful depending on who receives it, when, and why.

A mental health AI provides coping strategies for anxiety. The strategies are evidence-based and generally helpful. But if the user is experiencing acute suicidal ideation, coping strategies aren't sufficient. The user needs crisis intervention, not self-help tips. The AI's output was appropriate for moderate anxiety and catastrophically inadequate for severe crisis. Harm isn't in the content. It's in the mismatch between content and need.

A financial advice AI explains tax-loss harvesting. The explanation is accurate. For a user with a diversified portfolio and moderate risk tolerance, it's useful information. For a user who just lost their job and is considering liquidating retirement savings to cover expenses, the same advice is inappropriate. The user needs emergency financial planning, not tax optimization. Context determines whether advice helps or harms.

A fitness AI generates workout plans. For a healthy adult, the plan is safe and effective. For a user recovering from injury, the same plan could cause re-injury. For a user with an eating disorder, fitness advice can reinforce harmful behaviors regardless of content accuracy. The AI can't know the user's medical history unless they disclose it. Users in crisis often don't disclose. The AI gives helpful advice to the wrong person at the wrong time.

Context detection requires information the AI often doesn't have. User medical history, mental state, financial situation, legal status, relationship dynamics — these factors determine whether advice helps or harms, and they're invisible unless users volunteer them. Some users volunteer too much. Some volunteer nothing. Enforcement can't rely on users to self-report context accurately.

You can prompt users to provide context. "Before I help with this, can you tell me more about your situation?" works sometimes. Adversarial users lie. Users in crisis might not recognize their own crisis. Users with poor judgment won't self-identify as having poor judgment. Context detection based on user self-report is better than nothing but far from reliable.

## Over-Refusal vs Under-Refusal

Every content policy enforcement system must choose between refusing too much and refusing too little. Both create harm.

Over-refusal means blocking legitimate requests because they pattern-match to policy violations. A creative writing AI that refuses to depict any violence blocks authors writing crime novels, historical fiction, or literary drama. A medical AI that refuses to discuss suicide blocks healthcare providers trying to assess patient risk. A legal AI that refuses to discuss anything potentially illegal blocks law students studying criminal law. Over-refusal trades safety for utility. Users get frustrated and abandon the system.

Under-refusal means allowing harmful requests because enforcement is too permissive. An AI that answers every question without restriction enables harassment, fraud, violence, and abuse. Under-refusal trades utility for safety. Users get harmed and regulators intervene.

The optimal refusal rate isn't zero and it isn't 100%. It's somewhere in the middle, and "somewhere" depends on your user base, use case, and risk tolerance. A consumer AI serving millions of anonymous users skews toward over-refusal because adversarial use is common. An enterprise AI serving a known user base of domain experts skews toward under-refusal because false positives are more costly than false negatives.

Measure both error types. Track refusal rates on legitimate requests. Track compliance rates on policy violations. If refusal rate on legitimate requests exceeds 5%, users are getting frustrated. If compliance rate on policy violations exceeds 2%, enforcement is failing. Tune the boundary based on which failure mode matters more for your context.

Build escape hatches for over-refusal. "This request looks like it might violate our policy against X. If this is for a legitimate purpose like education or research, please provide more context and I'll try to help." Gives users a path around false positives without disabling enforcement entirely.

Build safeguards for under-refusal. Even if enforcement is permissive, log requests that approach policy boundaries. If a user makes 50 near-violation requests in 24 hours, flag the account for review. Permissive enforcement with monitoring is safer than permissive enforcement without visibility.

## Finding the Right Boundary

The boundary between helpful and harmful isn't a universal constant. It shifts based on domain, user, and context. Red teams help find it through systematic testing.

Start with clear cases. Build a test set of obviously helpful requests and obviously harmful requests. "Help me write a thank-you note" is helpful. "Help me write a threat" is harmful. If your enforcement doesn't cleanly separate these extremes, the system isn't ready for boundary cases.

Then test the middle. Build a test set of ambiguous requests where harm depends on context. "Help me write a message to someone who doesn't want to talk to me." Helpful if the user needs to apologize for a genuine mistake and respect boundaries. Harmful if the user is engaging in harassment. The request is identical. The context determines the classification.

Test graduated scenarios. Create variations of the same request that progressively shift from helpful to harmful. "Help me convince my colleague to support my project proposal" is professional persuasion. "Help me convince my colleague to support my proposal even though they've already said no" is pressure. "Help me convince them by making them think their job depends on it" is coercion. Somewhere between the first and third, the line was crossed. Find where.

Run the tests on real users. Show them the AI outputs and ask: was this helpful or harmful? Measure agreement rates. If 90% of users agree a response was harmful, enforcement should refuse it. If 50% say helpful and 50% say harmful, you're at the boundary. Document these edge cases.

Iterate enforcement based on findings. If a category of requests consistently lands in the ambiguous zone, build special handling. Maybe the AI asks clarifying questions. Maybe it provides warnings. Maybe it refuses and explains why the request is risky. Maybe it complies but logs for review. The handling strategy depends on the risk profile.

## User Intent Estimation

Intent determines whether help is harm. Estimating intent from text is extremely hard.

Explicit intent is rare. Users rarely say "I want to manipulate someone" or "I'm planning something illegal." They frame harmful requests as legitimate. Adversarial users are especially careful to signal benign intent. A scammer asking for help writing persuasive emails will claim they're a small business owner trying to improve customer communication. The AI can't tell the difference.

Implicit signals are weak. Request patterns might indicate intent. A user asking about persuasion, deception, impersonation, and bypassing security measures in sequence looks suspicious. But each individual request might be legitimate. A security researcher, journalist, or educator could have the same request pattern. Flagging based on patterns creates false positives.

Self-reported intent is unreliable. You can ask users "What are you trying to accomplish?" Some will answer honestly. Some will lie. Some don't fully understand their own intent. "I'm trying to get my ex to talk to me again" might be a genuine desire to apologize or a precursor to harassment. The user might not know which. The AI certainly doesn't.

Behavioral signals are delayed. If a user takes AI-generated content and uses it to harm someone, you learn their intent retroactively. That's too late to prevent the harm. Proactive intent detection requires prediction. Prediction requires assumptions about user behavior that are often wrong.

Best practice: assume ambiguous intent and design for harm reduction. If a request could be helpful or harmful depending on intent, provide the most useful response that minimizes harm potential. Explain limitations. Suggest alternatives. Warn about misuse. Don't refuse entirely unless harm is near-certain. Don't comply uncritically and assume benign intent.

## Graduated Response Approaches

Not every risky request deserves a hard refusal. Graduated responses match response to risk level.

For low-risk requests, comply with context. "Help me write a persuasive email to my boss" gets persuasive writing help plus a reminder about professional communication norms. The AI helps but adds guardrails.

For medium-risk requests, comply with warnings. "Help me write a message to someone who blocked me" triggers: "Before I help, I want to note that if someone has blocked you, they've indicated they don't want contact. Reaching out through other channels might be unwelcome or, in some cases, harassment. If you're trying to apologize or resolve a misunderstanding, consider whether this person is open to that conversation." Then the AI helps if the user confirms intent.

For high-risk requests, ask clarifying questions. "Help me convince someone to do something they've said they don't want to do" triggers: "Can you provide more context? I want to make sure I'm helping with persuasion, not manipulation. What's your relationship to this person? What's the situation?" Based on the user's clarification, the AI decides whether to help.

For critical-risk requests, refuse with explanation. "Help me impersonate a doctor to get medical information about someone" gets: "I can't help with that. Impersonating a healthcare provider to access someone else's medical information is illegal under HIPAA and similar laws. If you need medical records, here are the legal ways to request them..." The refusal explains why and offers legitimate alternatives.

Graduated responses reduce frustration from over-refusal and harm from under-refusal. Users who hit hard refusals for medium-risk requests get annoyed. Users who get unrestricted help for high-risk requests cause harm. Match response to risk.

## Learning from Edge Cases

Every edge case is a teaching moment. When you find a request that sits exactly on the helpful-harmful boundary, document it. Analyze it. Use it to refine policy.

Build an edge case repository. When red teams, users, or production monitoring surfaces a boundary case, add it to the repository with analysis. "User asked for help writing a complaint about workplace discrimination. AI initially refused, thinking it was a legal advice request. User was a discrimination victim trying to document mistreatment for HR. False positive. Enforcement updated to distinguish between requesting legal advice and requesting help articulating an experience."

Review edge cases quarterly. Patterns emerge. If 40% of edge cases involve requests for help with interpersonal conflict, your enforcement is struggling with social context. If 30% involve code generation, your programming assistance policies need refinement. Patterns point to where the boundary is poorly defined.

Test enforcement on edge cases after every update. Edge cases are where enforcement breaks. They're canaries in the coal mine. If a model update or policy change causes edge case performance to degrade, you're making the boundary less accurate.

Use edge cases to train reviewers. If you escalate ambiguous requests to human review, the humans need to understand where the boundary is. Show them 100 edge cases with ground truth decisions. Measure inter-rater reliability. If different reviewers classify the same edge case differently, your boundary definition is unclear even to humans.

Share edge case insights across teams. Safety teams learn about boundary failures. Product teams learn about user needs the AI isn't meeting. Legal teams learn about liability risks. Engineering teams learn about capability gaps. Edge cases are cross-functional learning opportunities.

## Evolving the Boundary Over Time

The helpful-harmful boundary isn't static. User expectations change. Adversarial tactics evolve. Regulations shift. The boundary you set in 2024 is wrong by 2026.

Monitor societal norms. What was acceptable to say in AI outputs in 2023 might be considered harmful in 2026. Conversational AI that was aggressively persuasive in early deployments faces backlash now. Users expect AI to inform, not manipulate. The boundary moved. Your enforcement should move with it.

Monitor regulatory developments. The EU AI Act, enacted in 2025, classifies certain AI systems as high-risk and imposes content requirements. What was a product decision in 2024 is a legal requirement in 2026. Boundaries shift from "what users tolerate" to "what regulators mandate."

Monitor adversarial evolution. Techniques that were sophisticated jailbreaks in 2024 are mainstream knowledge in 2026. Boundaries that held against early adversarial probing fail against coordinated campaigns. As attacks improve, defenses must tighten.

Monitor your own capability growth. As models get more capable, the harm potential increases. An AI that can generate mediocre persuasive content has lower manipulation risk than one that generates expert-level persuasion. As your system improves, your boundaries must account for the increased power.

Run boundary reviews biannually. Gather red team findings, production incidents, user feedback, regulatory updates, and competitive intelligence. Ask: is the current boundary still appropriate? Should enforcement tighten? Should it relax in some areas and tighten in others? Update policy and enforcement based on evidence.

The line between helpful and harmful is the hardest red teaming challenge because it requires judgment, not just technical skill. You're not finding bugs. You're finding philosophical boundaries in a space where reasonable people disagree. Document your reasoning. Test your assumptions. Accept that you'll get some decisions wrong and iterate when you do.

This concludes Chapter 9 on Social Engineering and Harm Amplification. The next chapter covers red team operations and methodology — how to build, staff, and run a red team that systematically finds the failures before they reach production.
