# Labeling and Annotation Operations

Labeling is how humans encode judgment into data. Every eval metric, every release gate, every safety check, and every quality signal traces back to a human decision about what counts as good, acceptable, dangerous, or broken. In 2026, most AI teams fail not because their models are bad, but because their labels are inconsistent, their guidelines are vague, their annotators are miscalibrated, and their ontologies are a mess. This section covers the entire labeling operation — from fundamentals through governance, workforce management, AI-assisted labeling, tooling, security, economics, and the hardest edge cases.

*We begin with the fundamentals — what labeling actually is, why it breaks, and why most teams discover their labeling problems far too late.*
