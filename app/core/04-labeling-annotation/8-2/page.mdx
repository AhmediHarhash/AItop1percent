# 8.2 — 2026 Platform Criteria: Multimodal, Agent Traces, LLM Output Review, Annotator Analytics

In September 2025, a conversational AI startup with a $3.2 million seed round began evaluating labeling platforms for their customer support agent. The agent handled text, images from customer uploads, and occasionally audio recordings. The product team assumed any modern labeling platform would handle these formats. They selected a platform based on a sales demo that showed beautiful image annotation and text classification. They signed a $45,000 annual contract. In the first week of production use, the team discovered the platform could display images and text but not in the same annotation task—multimodal tasks required uploading each modality separately and manually correlating labels across tasks. The platform had no support for agent conversation traces where the context included multiple turns, tool calls, and retrieved documents. It had no rubric-based evaluation interface for comparing model outputs. The annotator analytics dashboard showed only task completion counts, with no quality metrics, learning curves, or skill-based performance breakdowns. By November 2025, the team had built custom tooling on top of the platform to handle multimodal annotation, agent trace review, and output comparison. They spent $78,000 in engineering time replicating features they thought they were buying. In January 2026, they attempted to migrate to a platform built for LLM-era workflows. The migration took seven weeks and cost an additional $52,000 in engineering time and lost labeling productivity. The root cause was not the vendor lying—the platform genuinely did what it advertised. The failure was the team evaluating based on 2023 criteria when their 2026 use cases required fundamentally different capabilities.

The labeling platform landscape in 2026 is bifurcated. One set of platforms was designed for the pre-LLM era—image classification, object detection, named entity recognition on short texts. These platforms handle those tasks well but struggle with the complexity of modern AI systems. The other set of platforms was built or substantially rebuilt to handle multimodal content, agent interactions, long-form generation, and the quality assessment challenges that LLM systems introduce. If you're building systems that involve language models, agents, or multimodal understanding, the capabilities that distinguish these modern platforms from legacy tools are not nice-to-haves. They're mandatory. Using a legacy platform for LLM-era workflows is like using a bicycle to move furniture—it technically moves things from place to place but not the things you actually need to move.

This subchapter walks you through the four capability categories that separate modern labeling platforms from legacy tools: multimodal annotation support, agent trace and tool call review, LLM output evaluation interfaces, and annotator analytics for quality and performance management. You will learn what each capability entails, why it matters for production AI systems, what to look for in vendor demonstrations, and what red flags indicate a platform is stuck in the pre-LLM era. The goal is to ensure that when you evaluate platforms, you test the capabilities that actually matter for your 2026 use cases rather than being impressed by features that were innovative in 2022 but are now table stakes.

## Multimodal Annotation Support: Beyond Single-Format Tasks

Legacy labeling platforms treat each data modality as a separate universe. You label images in one workflow, text in another, audio in a third. If your task involves multiple modalities, you create separate labeling tasks for each format and manually correlate the results afterward. This approach breaks down completely when the modalities are interdependent. A customer support interaction might include a text description, a screenshot of the error, and a video recording of the issue. The label you assign to the text depends on what you see in the screenshot and what you hear in the video. Forcing labelers to jump between three separate tasks destroys context and introduces errors.

Modern platforms support native multimodal annotation where a single task can display text, images, video, and audio simultaneously with synchronized controls. A labeler reviewing a customer support ticket sees the text transcript, the uploaded screenshot, and the video recording in a single interface. They can play the video while reading the transcript to understand context. They can annotate specific regions of the image and link those annotations to specific transcript segments. The platform maintains the relationship between annotations across modalities so when you export labels, you get a unified representation of the interaction, not three separate files you need to join manually.

The technical requirements for true multimodal support go beyond just rendering multiple file types on the same page. The platform must handle synchronization—when a labeler clicks a timestamp in a transcript, the video should jump to that point. When they annotate a region in an image, they should be able to link that annotation to a specific text span or audio segment. The platform must handle cross-modal references in the data model so annotations on one modality can reference entities or events in another. The export format must preserve these relationships in a way that your downstream processing can consume.

The use cases that require multimodal annotation are increasingly common. Autonomous vehicle systems annotate sensor fusion data where camera images, LIDAR point clouds, and radar returns must be labeled together because the ground truth depends on all three. Medical diagnostic systems annotate clinical notes, lab results, imaging studies, and patient history as a unified case because diagnosis requires integrating across modalities. E-commerce support systems annotate customer messages, product images, order histories, and return photos together because resolution decisions depend on all the context. If your domain involves any of these patterns, a platform without native multimodal support will force you to build complex workarounds or accept degraded label quality.

When evaluating multimodal support, ask vendors to demonstrate annotation tasks that include at least three different formats simultaneously. Bring your own data—a customer support case with text, image, and audio, or a diagnostic case with notes, imaging, and lab results. Watch how labelers navigate between modalities. Check whether the interface provides synchronized playback and navigation. Verify that annotations on one modality can reference entities in another. Export a sample task and examine the output format to ensure cross-modal relationships are preserved. If the vendor demonstrates each modality separately or shows a UI where different modalities are in separate tabs without synchronization, the platform does not have true multimodal support.

## Agent Trace and Tool Call Review: Annotating Reasoning Chains

The shift from single-turn model calls to multi-turn agent interactions introduces annotation challenges that legacy platforms were not designed to handle. When you evaluate a traditional NLP model, you label input-output pairs—the text goes in, the classification or extraction comes out. When you evaluate an agent, you need to label the entire reasoning trace—the initial prompt, the agent's reasoning steps, the tools it called, the results it received, the decisions it made based on those results, and the final output. Each step in the trace can succeed or fail independently. The agent might correctly identify that it needs to call a database query tool, but call it with the wrong parameters. It might receive correct results but misinterpret them. It might produce a correct final output via a flawed reasoning process or an incorrect output after apparently sound reasoning.

Modern platforms provide agent trace annotation interfaces that display the full interaction tree. Labelers see the initial prompt, the agent's plan, each tool call with arguments, the tool results, the agent's interpretation, and the final response. They can annotate each node in the tree—marking which tool calls were appropriate, which parameters were correct, which interpretations were accurate, and whether the final output was acceptable. They can label failure modes at the specific step where they occurred. This granular annotation lets you diagnose why agents fail. You can identify whether failures stem from poor planning, incorrect tool selection, parameter errors, result misinterpretation, or reasoning errors in combining information.

The technical requirements for agent trace review go beyond displaying logs. The platform must parse your agent's execution format—whether that's LangChain traces, OpenAI function calls, custom JSON logs, or proprietary agent frameworks. It must render the trace as a navigable tree or timeline, not as linear text logs. It must let labelers collapse and expand branches to focus on specific reasoning paths. It must support annotations at different granularities—labeling an entire trace as success or failure, labeling individual tool calls, labeling specific parameter values, labeling reasoning steps. The export format must preserve the tree structure and annotations at each level so you can analyze failure modes systematically.

The use cases that require agent trace annotation are expanding rapidly. Customer support agents that use multiple tools to retrieve account information, check order status, and process returns need trace-level evaluation to understand when tool selection is wrong versus when tool execution is correct but results are misinterpreted. Research agents that search databases, retrieve papers, synthesize findings, and generate reports need trace annotation to identify where in the pipeline quality degrades. Code generation agents that read specifications, search documentation, generate code, run tests, and iterate based on failures need trace-level labels to understand which step in the workflow needs improvement.

When evaluating agent trace support, provide vendors with a sample agent execution trace from your system. Ask them to demonstrate how a labeler would review it. Check whether the interface displays the full tree structure or just a linear log. Verify that labelers can annotate individual nodes without re-labeling the entire trace. Test whether the platform supports your trace format or requires you to transform it into a vendor-specific schema. Export a labeled trace and verify that the output includes node-level annotations with the tree structure intact. If the vendor treats agent traces as long text documents without structured navigation or node-level annotation support, the platform is not equipped for agent evaluation.

## LLM Output Evaluation Interfaces: Rubrics, Comparisons, and Quality Dimensions

Evaluating LLM outputs introduces challenges that traditional labeling interfaces do not address. When you label an image, you draw bounding boxes or select categories—the annotation is discrete and the interface is spatial. When you evaluate whether a language model's output is helpful, harmless, and accurate, the judgment is multidimensional and often comparative. You're not marking right or wrong. You're assessing whether the response directly answers the question, whether it includes hallucinated facts, whether the tone is appropriate, whether it avoids harmful content, whether it provides sufficient detail without being verbose. Each dimension might require a different rubric. Some dimensions are binary, others are graded scales, others are free-text explanations.

Modern platforms provide LLM output evaluation interfaces designed for these multidimensional assessments. Labelers see the input prompt and the model output in a clear format. They rate the output across multiple rubric dimensions—factual accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety, tone, completeness. Each dimension has a clear definition, a rating scale, and examples of what each scale point means. The platform supports both Likert scales for quantitative analysis and free-text feedback for qualitative insights. It supports comparative evaluation where labelers see two or more model outputs side by side and select which is better, or rank them, or rate them independently. This comparative mode is critical for training reward models and conducting A/B tests of model versions.

The technical requirements for LLM output evaluation go beyond adding rating widgets to a text display. The platform must support custom rubrics that match your domain and use case. A customer support evaluation rubric is completely different from a creative writing rubric or a medical question answering rubric. The platform must handle long-form outputs—thousands of words—with readable formatting and scroll synchronization when comparing multiple outputs. It must support multi-turn conversations where the evaluation applies to an entire dialogue, not just a single response. It must track inter-annotator agreement across rubric dimensions so you can identify which criteria are consistently understood versus which need clearer definitions.

The use cases that require LLM output evaluation are now the majority of labeling work in many organizations. You evaluate chatbot responses for quality, safety, and brand alignment. You evaluate summarization outputs for accuracy, completeness, and readability. You evaluate code generation for correctness, security, and style. You evaluate creative content for originality, coherence, and audience appropriateness. Every one of these use cases requires multidimensional rubric-based evaluation with support for comparative ranking.

When evaluating LLM output review capabilities, ask vendors to demonstrate evaluation of a long-form generation task using a custom rubric with at least five dimensions. Provide your own rubric definitions and sample outputs. Watch how labelers navigate long outputs, how they access rubric definitions while rating, how they provide written feedback. Test comparative evaluation with three model outputs side by side. Check whether the platform supports multi-turn dialogue evaluation or only single responses. Export a sample evaluation and verify that the output includes per-dimension ratings, written feedback, and comparative rankings with clear linkage to the specific outputs being evaluated. If the vendor demonstrates only binary thumbs-up-thumbs-down ratings or single-dimensional quality scores, the platform does not support the depth of evaluation that LLM systems require.

## Annotator Analytics: Quality, Performance, and Skill Development

Legacy labeling platforms treat annotators as interchangeable labor. They track task completion counts and maybe overall accuracy against gold standards. They provide no visibility into learning curves, no identification of which annotators excel at which task types, no detection of quality degradation over time, no measurement of how instruction changes affect performance. This was acceptable when labeling tasks were simple and annotators required minimal training. It is unacceptable in 2026 when labeling increasingly requires domain expertise, contextual judgment, and multi-step reasoning.

Modern platforms provide comprehensive annotator analytics that treat labeling as a skilled profession. They track annotator performance across multiple dimensions—accuracy, consistency, throughput, attention to edge cases, adherence to guidelines. They measure inter-annotator agreement and identify pairs of annotators who consistently disagree, which indicates either that one needs retraining or that the guidelines are ambiguous. They display learning curves that show how each annotator's quality improves over their first hundred tasks, which helps you calibrate training effectiveness. They detect performance degradation that might indicate fatigue, loss of focus, or misunderstanding of updated guidelines. They support skill-based routing where complex tasks are assigned to annotators who have demonstrated expertise in that task type.

The technical requirements for annotator analytics go beyond dashboard widgets. The platform must track labels at the annotator level with timestamps so you can analyze performance trends over time. It must maintain gold-standard test sets that are injected into labeling queues without annotators knowing which tasks are tests. It must compute quality metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1—at the annotator level and at the task type level. It must provide drill-down views where you can see which specific labels an annotator got wrong and what patterns emerge. It must support cohort analysis where you compare annotators who received different training or different versions of the guidelines.

The use cases that require annotator analytics are any labeling operation at scale. If you employ ten annotators labeling 50,000 items per month, you need to know which annotators are delivering quality work, which need additional training, and which should be moved to different task types where they perform better. If you update labeling guidelines, you need to measure how quickly annotators adapt and whether the changes improve consistency. If you hire new annotators, you need to track their learning curve and identify when they reach acceptable quality levels. If you offshore labeling to a vendor, you need analytics to hold them accountable for quality commitments.

When evaluating annotator analytics, ask vendors to demonstrate a dashboard populated with real data, not sample data. Look for per-annotator metrics, learning curves, agreement matrices, task type breakdowns, and trend analysis. Ask how gold-standard tests are injected and scored. Check whether the platform supports custom quality metrics for your domain or only generic accuracy. Verify that you can export annotator performance data for your own analysis. Test whether the platform provides actionable insights—flagging annotators who need retraining, identifying task types with low agreement, surfacing quality regressions—or just displays numbers. If the vendor shows only aggregate throughput metrics without per-annotator quality analytics, the platform does not support the workforce management needs of production labeling operations.

## Red Flags That Indicate a Platform Is Stuck in the Pre-LLM Era

Several red flags during platform evaluation indicate that the vendor has not adapted to LLM-era labeling requirements. The first is a feature list that emphasizes bounding boxes and image segmentation but barely mentions text, conversations, or multimodal tasks. Platforms built for computer vision in 2019 have deep capabilities in spatial annotation but shallow capabilities in language and reasoning tasks. If the vendor's hero demos are all object detection and semantic segmentation, ask hard questions about their support for your actual use cases.

The second red flag is no native support for conversations or multi-turn interactions. If the platform treats each message in a conversation as a separate task and cannot display threads with context, it cannot handle chatbot or agent evaluation. Evaluating a customer support bot response without seeing the previous three turns is like diagnosing a patient without seeing their medical history—you miss critical context.

The third red flag is binary or single-dimensional quality ratings. If the platform supports only thumbs-up or thumbs-down, or only a single quality score, it cannot handle the multidimensional evaluation that LLM outputs require. You cannot improve a summarization system if your labels only say "good" or "bad" without distinguishing whether the problem is factual accuracy, completeness, or readability.

The fourth red flag is no comparative evaluation support. If the platform cannot display two model outputs side by side for labelers to compare and rank, you cannot train reward models or conduct preference-based evaluations. This capability was niche three years ago but is central to LLM development in 2026.

The fifth red flag is no support for long-form content. If the vendor demo uses three-sentence paragraphs and 50-word responses, test the platform with 2,000-word documents and 1,500-word generations. Many platforms render long text in ways that are unusable—tiny scroll windows, no formatting preservation, no ability to jump to specific sections. If labelers cannot efficiently review the content you actually produce, the platform is not fit for purpose.

The sixth red flag is generic annotator analytics. If the platform tracks only task counts or aggregate accuracy without per-annotator learning curves, inter-annotator agreement matrices, or skill-based performance breakdowns, it treats annotators as interchangeable workers rather than skilled professionals. This might work for simple image classification but fails for complex LLM evaluation where annotator expertise is a primary quality determinant.

The seventh red flag is no API support for modern data formats. If the platform requires you to convert your data into CSV or JSON formats from 2020, it has not kept pace with how LLM systems structure inputs and outputs. Platforms built for 2026 should natively support formats like JSONL for conversations, Parquet for large datasets, and protocol buffers for agent traces.

## Testing Capabilities With Your Real Use Cases

The only way to validate whether a platform supports the capabilities you need is to test it with your actual data and workflows. Vendor demos with curated examples tell you what the platform can do under ideal conditions, not what it will do with your messy production data. Allocate time for a proof-of-concept evaluation where you upload representative samples of your data, configure workflows that match your use cases, have your team members perform actual labeling tasks, and verify that the output meets your quality and format requirements.

For multimodal support, prepare a sample task that includes at least three modalities your real use cases require. Upload it to the platform and have a labeler annotate it. Verify that the interface displays all modalities simultaneously, that navigation is synchronized, that cross-modal annotations are possible, and that the export preserves relationships.

For agent trace review, export a sample trace from your agent system and upload it to the platform. Configure the platform to parse and display it. Have a labeler annotate specific tool calls, parameters, and reasoning steps. Export the annotated trace and verify that node-level labels are preserved with tree structure intact.

For LLM output evaluation, define a custom rubric with at least five dimensions relevant to your use case. Configure the platform to use this rubric. Upload three model outputs for the same input. Have a labeler rate all three and rank them. Export the results and verify that per-dimension ratings, written feedback, and rankings are all captured correctly.

For annotator analytics, run a pilot labeling project with five annotators and at least 500 tasks including gold-standard tests. After two weeks, review the analytics dashboard. Verify that you see per-annotator accuracy, learning curves, agreement matrices, and quality trends. Test whether the platform flags annotators who need attention or just displays numbers.

If any of these proof-of-concept tests fail or require substantial workarounds, the platform does not support the capability as claimed. No amount of sales promises will change the underlying product. The time you invest in rigorous testing prevents the expensive mistake of choosing a platform that cannot handle your actual requirements, discovering the limitations three months into production use, and either living with degraded workflows or migrating to a different platform.

## Balancing Cutting-Edge Capabilities With Operational Maturity

The ideal labeling platform in 2026 combines cutting-edge capabilities for multimodal annotation, agent trace review, LLM output evaluation, and annotator analytics with operational maturity—stability, performance, security, compliance, support. Emerging platforms built specifically for LLM-era workflows often excel at modern features but lack the operational polish of established vendors. Established platforms have excellent reliability and compliance but may be slow to adopt new capabilities.

Your choice depends on your priorities and risk tolerance. If you're a research team exploring novel agent architectures, you might prioritize cutting-edge trace review capabilities even if it means accepting some operational rough edges. If you're a regulated financial services company, you might prioritize SOC 2 compliance and 99.9% uptime even if it means waiting six months for the vendor to add comparative LLM evaluation features. If you're a high-growth startup, you might prioritize fast iteration and integration ease, accepting limitations in either modern features or operational maturity as long as the platform doesn't block your roadmap.

The mistake teams make is assuming they can have everything. You cannot simultaneously have the most advanced feature set, the most mature operations, the lowest cost, and the best support. Every platform makes tradeoffs. Your job is to understand which tradeoffs align with your priorities and which are deal-breakers. Document your requirements with clear must-have versus nice-to-have distinctions. Score platforms against these requirements using evidence from proof-of-concept testing, not vendor claims. Make the decision deliberately and document the rationale so future teams understand what you optimized for and what limitations you accepted.

The labeling platform you choose will shape your AI development velocity, quality, and cost for the next two years. Choose based on whether the platform supports the work you actually need to do in 2026, not based on features that were impressive in 2023 or promises about what the vendor will build in 2027. Test the capabilities that matter—multimodal annotation, agent trace review, LLM output evaluation, annotator analytics—with your real data and your real workflows. Accept that no platform is perfect but ensure the gaps are acceptable and that you have mitigation strategies for the limitations you're choosing to live with.

You now understand the capability categories that separate modern labeling platforms from legacy tools, how to test each capability rigorously, and what red flags indicate a platform has not adapted to LLM-era requirements. The next step is understanding how to architect label storage so that your labels remain usable, auditable, and accessible as your systems evolve, which we cover in the label storage architecture patterns that follow.
