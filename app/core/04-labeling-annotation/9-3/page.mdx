# 9.3 — Cost Optimization Without Quality Sacrifice

In mid-2025, a legal technology company spent $340,000 over seven months labeling 85,000 documents for contract clause extraction. Every document received expert legal review, even though 60% of the documents were standard NDAs and employment agreements with identical clause patterns. The labeling lead had requested expert-level annotators because "quality matters in legal," and no one questioned whether every single document needed the same level of scrutiny. When the CFO reviewed the invoice, she asked a simple question: did we really need senior attorneys billing at $180 per hour to label the same standard NDA template two thousand times? The answer was no. The company had conflated "high quality requirements" with "uniform maximum effort," and it cost them roughly $140,000 in unnecessary labor. They had the budget, so they survived, but the waste meant they couldn't label the next dataset they needed for medical contract analysis. Cost optimization is not about cutting corners. It is about applying effort proportional to difficulty and value, eliminating waste, and designing workflows that let humans focus on the work only they can do.

## The Uniform Effort Fallacy

Most labeling programs treat every example as equally difficult and equally important. They route all tasks to the same annotator tier, apply the same review process, and allocate the same time budget per item. This is operationally simple, but economically inefficient. In any real dataset, difficulty varies by orders of magnitude. Some examples are trivial and unambiguous. Some are edge cases that require domain expertise and contextual judgment. Some are near-duplicates of examples you have already labeled. Treating all of them identically wastes money on the easy ones and often under-invests in the hard ones.

The legal tech company's dataset had three distinct tiers of difficulty. Tier one was standard templates: NDAs, offer letters, mutual confidentiality agreements. These documents appeared in dozens of nearly identical copies, and the clause structure was fixed. Tier two was customized agreements: vendor contracts, partnership agreements, SaaS terms of service. These had variability, but the clauses were well-defined and the annotator could resolve most ambiguities with the guidelines. Tier three was unusual or complex agreements: mergers and acquisitions documents, international joint ventures, heavily negotiated amendments. These required legal expertise to interpret intent and classify non-standard language.

A senior attorney labeling tier one documents was overkill. A paralegal or trained contract analyst could label them in one-third the time at one-fifth the cost with equal accuracy, because the task required pattern recognition, not legal interpretation. The company eventually restructured their workflow: tier one routed to contract analysts at $35 per hour, tier two to junior attorneys at $85 per hour, tier three to senior attorneys at $180 per hour. They re-labeled a comparable dataset of 80,000 documents for $148,000 instead of $340,000, with no measurable quality difference. The savings came entirely from matching task difficulty to annotator capability.

## AI-Assisted Pre-Labeling as a Force Multiplier

The fastest way to reduce human labeling time is to let the model do the first pass. AI-assisted pre-labeling means you run your current model, or a cheap general-purpose model, over the unlabeled data to generate draft labels, then route those drafts to human annotators for correction and approval. Instead of labeling from scratch, the human reviews, edits, and confirms. When the pre-labels are even moderately accurate, this cuts human time by 40% to 70%, because correcting is faster than creating.

A healthcare analytics company labeling clinical notes for symptom extraction tried pre-labeling with a fine-tuned BioBERT model in late 2024. The model's precision was 76% and recall was 68% on their internal test set, which sounds mediocre, but it was good enough for pre-labeling. The human annotators no longer started with blank text. They started with spans already highlighted and entity types already suggested. When the model was correct, the annotator clicked approve and moved on in five seconds instead of sixty. When the model was wrong, the annotator deleted or edited the span, which still took less time than finding and labeling it from scratch. The company measured a 58% reduction in median time per note: from 4.2 minutes to 1.8 minutes. Over 100,000 notes, that saved roughly 4,000 hours of labor, worth approximately $110,000 at their blended annotator rate.

Pre-labeling works best when the model is better than random and when the task is structured. It works poorly when the model is so bad that the human spends more time undoing wrong labels than they would have spent labeling from scratch, or when the task is highly subjective and seeing the model's suggestion biases the human's judgment. You need to measure both time savings and quality impact. If pre-labeling introduces anchoring bias where humans just accept whatever the model suggests, you will save time but degrade quality. The solution is to A/B test: run a sample batch with pre-labeling, run a comparable batch from scratch, measure both throughput and inter-annotator agreement against gold labels, and compare. If time drops and quality holds, deploy pre-labeling. If quality drops, investigate whether it is correctable with interface changes, guidance, or model improvements.

The healthcare company found anchoring bias in one specific entity type: "severity level" for symptoms. When the model pre-labeled a symptom as "moderate," annotators accepted it 91% of the time, even in cases where the gold standard said "severe" or "mild." The model was wrong 30% of the time on severity, but humans were not catching it because the suggestion looked plausible. The company fixed this by removing pre-labels for severity only, while keeping pre-labels for symptom spans and types. They accepted a small reduction in time savings in exchange for preserving quality on the dimension that mattered most to downstream clinical risk scoring.

## Tiered Review: Not Everything Needs Expert Verification

Review is expensive. If you review every label with a second annotator or a domain expert, you double your labor cost per example. Many programs do this because they fear quality degradation, but uniform review is overkill. The right approach is risk-based tiered review: review the examples where error is most likely or most costly, and skip or sample-review the rest.

A financial services company labeling transaction narratives for fraud signal detection implemented three review tiers in early 2025. Tier one was high-confidence labels: cases where the annotator selected a label with no hesitation flags, the example was similar to previously labeled gold examples, and the annotator's historical accuracy on that label type was above 94%. These labels went into the dataset with no review. Tier two was medium-confidence labels: cases where the annotator flagged uncertainty, the example was unusual, or the annotator's historical accuracy on that label type was between 85% and 94%. These labels went to a second annotator for blind re-labeling, and disagreements went to an adjudicator. Tier three was high-risk labels: cases involving amounts over $50,000, cases labeled as confirmed fraud, or cases where the two annotators disagreed after tier two review. These went to a domain expert for final review.

The distribution was roughly 68% tier one, 26% tier two, 6% tier three. Tier one had zero incremental review cost. Tier two added one additional annotator pass for 26% of the data. Tier three added expert review for 6% of the data. The blended review cost was roughly 0.38 additional passes per example, compared to 1.0 additional passes for uniform review. That cut review labor cost by 62%, saving approximately $94,000 over six months. Spot checks on tier one labels showed accuracy of 96.1%, which was statistically indistinguishable from the accuracy of reviewed labels, because the filtering criteria selected for cases that were genuinely unambiguous.

Tiered review requires infrastructure to route tasks based on confidence signals. You need annotators to flag uncertainty, you need historical accuracy tracking per annotator and per label type, and you need automated routing rules. Most labeling platforms support this, but you have to configure it deliberately. The default is usually uniform routing, because it is simpler. The financial services company built their routing logic as a Python script that read annotator output, calculated confidence scores, and wrote task assignments to the platform's API. It took one engineer three days to build and has saved tens of thousands of dollars per quarter since deployment.

## Batch Optimization: Reducing Context-Switching and Rework

Annotators are more accurate and faster when they label similar examples consecutively. If you randomize task assignment, the annotator switches context constantly: one minute they are labeling a product return, the next minute a billing inquiry, the next minute a technical support question. Each switch requires them to reload the relevant part of the guidelines and re-calibrate their judgment. This slows them down and increases error rates. Batch optimization means grouping similar examples together and assigning them as a block, so the annotator builds momentum and consistency.

A customer support platform labeling tickets for intent classification tested batch assignment in late 2024. In the baseline condition, annotators received a random queue of 200 tickets spanning twelve intent categories. In the batched condition, annotators received a queue of 200 tickets from a single intent category, then moved to the next category. The company measured throughput and accuracy for 25 annotators over two weeks. Batched assignment increased median throughput by 23%: from 38 tickets per hour to 47 tickets per hour. It also increased inter-annotator agreement by 4.2 percentage points, from 89.1% to 93.3%, because annotators were applying the same judgment criteria consistently within a batch instead of re-interpreting them for every category switch.

Batching works well for categorical and extraction tasks where the label schema has multiple distinct types. It works less well for binary tasks with only one decision dimension, because there is no context to batch. It also works poorly if your data arrival rate is too low to form meaningful batches; if you only get five examples per category per day, you cannot wait to accumulate a batch of fifty without delaying your labeling pipeline by ten days. The solution is to batch when you have sufficient volume and to randomize when you do not, and to track which examples were labeled in which condition so you can measure any quality difference.

The customer support company also found that batching reduced rework. In the randomized condition, annotators frequently mis-labeled edge cases that sat on the boundary between two intent categories, because they had not recently seen a clear example of either category. In the batched condition, those edge cases appeared immediately after a series of clear examples, so the annotator's mental model of the category was sharp and calibrated. Rework dropped from 8.4% of labels flagged for correction during QA review to 3.1%, which saved approximately 220 hours of re-labeling effort over the two-week test period.

## Reducing Rework Through Better Guidelines and Calibration

Rework is pure waste. Every label that must be corrected after initial annotation is double labor cost: you paid for the wrong label, then you paid again to fix it. The root cause of most rework is not annotator carelessness; it is ambiguous guidelines, insufficient examples, or lack of calibration on edge cases. If ten annotators interpret the same guideline ten different ways, rework is inevitable. The solution is to invest in guideline quality and calibration up front, which prevents rework later.

A media company labeling video content for age-appropriateness ratings had a rework rate of 19% in their first labeling sprint in early 2025. Nineteen percent of labels were overturned during expert review, which meant they were paying for nearly 1.2 labels per video instead of 1.0. The labeling lead investigated the disagreements and found three recurring patterns. First, the guideline for "mild violence" versus "moderate violence" was subjective and underspecified; it said "use your judgment" without defining what factors to weigh. Second, the guideline did not address how to handle violence in comedic or cartoonish contexts, so annotators made inconsistent calls. Third, the guideline did not specify whether to rate the most intense moment in the video or the overall average tone, so some annotators rated based on peaks and others on averages.

The labeling lead rewrote the guideline with explicit decision trees and comparative examples. "Mild violence" was defined as physical conflict with no visible injury, no blood, no weapons, and no sustained intensity; examples included slapstick comedy falls and cartoon characters bonking each other on the head. "Moderate violence" was defined as physical conflict with visible injury, brief blood, improvised weapons, or sustained intensity; examples included fistfights with bruising and car crashes with minor injuries. The guideline specified that ratings should reflect the most intense five-second span in the video, not the average, and that comedic framing does not reduce the intensity rating unless the violence is so absurd that no reasonable viewer would perceive threat. The labeling lead ran a recalibration session where all annotators labeled thirty test videos and discussed disagreements as a group until consensus emerged.

Rework dropped from 19% to 4.6% in the next sprint. The company saved roughly $68,000 over the following four months, because they were no longer paying to re-label one out of every five videos. The investment in guideline improvement was approximately twelve hours of the labeling lead's time plus three hours of group calibration for twenty annotators, totaling around $8,000 in labor cost. The ROI was clear: spending $8,000 to save $68,000 is obvious, but many programs skip the up-front investment because they are in a hurry to start labeling, and they pay for it in rework later.

## Negotiating Vendor Rates and Structuring Contracts for Efficiency

If you use a labeling vendor, your contract structure directly affects cost efficiency. Most vendors charge per labeled example or per hour, and the rates vary based on volume, task complexity, turnaround time, and your negotiating leverage. Many teams accept the first rate sheet the vendor provides, but pricing is negotiable, especially at scale. You can reduce costs by 15% to 35% through volume commitments, flexible deadlines, and performance-based pricing.

A logistics company labeling millions of product images for catalog categorization negotiated a tiered pricing structure with their vendor in late 2024. The vendor's initial proposal was $0.22 per image with a 48-hour SLA. The company's labeling lead proposed a revised structure: $0.16 per image for batches over 100,000 images delivered with a 96-hour SLA, $0.19 per image for batches between 10,000 and 100,000 images delivered with a 72-hour SLA, and $0.24 per image for urgent batches under 10,000 images delivered within 24 hours. The company committed to a minimum volume of 2 million images over twelve months, which gave the vendor revenue certainty and allowed them to staff efficiently.

The company's actual labeling need was not uniform across time. Some months they needed 300,000 images labeled, other months they needed 80,000. By batching requests into the high-volume tier whenever possible and tolerating a four-day turnaround instead of two days, they labeled 1.9 million of their 2.4 million images at the $0.16 rate instead of the $0.22 rate. That saved $114,000 over the year. The remaining 500,000 images were split between the mid-tier and urgent tier, but the blended rate was still 18% lower than the original proposal.

Performance-based pricing is another lever. Instead of paying per example regardless of quality, you can negotiate a rate for accepted labels and a reduced rate or no payment for labels that fail QA. This shifts quality risk to the vendor and incentivizes them to invest in annotator training and guidelines. A healthcare company labeling radiology reports negotiated a contract where they paid full rate for labels that passed their expert review and 50% rate for labels that failed and required rework. The vendor's accuracy was 91% in the first month, which meant the company paid 95.5% of the full rate on a blended basis (91% at full rate plus 9% at half rate). The vendor quickly improved their training and guidelines, because every failed label cost them half their revenue, and accuracy rose to 97% within three months. The company's effective cost per accepted label dropped by 6%, and they received higher quality with no adversarial dynamic, because the vendor's incentive was aligned with quality, not just throughput.

## Reusing and Augmenting Labels to Avoid Redundant Work

Every label you create has potential reuse value. If you label a customer support ticket as "billing inquiry," and six months later you receive an almost identical ticket, you should not label it again from scratch. You should retrieve the previous label, verify it still applies, and reuse it. Label reuse is most effective for tasks with low variability and high repetition: duplicate detection, standard document classification, FAQ matching. It is less effective for tasks where context changes rapidly, like news article categorization or real-time content moderation, but even there you can reuse labels for template-like content.

A tax preparation software company labels tax-related questions submitted by users to route them to the right support specialist. Many questions are near-duplicates: "How do I deduct home office expenses?" appears in hundreds of minor variations every tax season. In 2024, the company labeled each variation as a new example, even when the intent and answer were identical. In 2025, they implemented a label reuse pipeline. When a new question arrives, they embed it with a sentence transformer model and retrieve the five nearest neighbors from previously labeled questions. If the cosine similarity to the nearest neighbor exceeds 0.92, they surface that previous label to the annotator as a suggested label. The annotator reviews the suggested label and either accepts it, modifies it, or rejects it and labels from scratch.

The reuse rate was 34%: 34% of new questions were sufficiently similar to a previous question that the annotator accepted the suggested label with no modification. Each reuse saved approximately 40 seconds of labeling time compared to labeling from scratch. Over 180,000 questions labeled in the 2025 tax season, that saved roughly 2,000 hours of labor, worth approximately $52,000. The infrastructure to support reuse was a vector database for embeddings, a retrieval API, and a front-end modification to display suggestions, which took one engineer two weeks to build. The ROI was positive within the first month.

Data augmentation can also reduce labeling load, though it is technically distinct from reuse. If you label one example and can programmatically generate variations of it that preserve the label, you have effectively created multiple labeled examples for the cost of one. This works well for tasks where label-preserving transformations are obvious: synonym substitution for text classification, cropping and rotation for image classification, paraphrasing for intent detection. It works poorly for tasks where the label is sensitive to subtle details, like sentiment analysis or nuanced content moderation.

The tax software company used paraphrasing augmentation for high-frequency question types. When an annotator labeled a question as "home office deduction," the system generated three paraphrased variations using a controlled paraphrasing model, then routed those paraphrases to a second annotator for verification. If the second annotator confirmed that all three paraphrases had the same intent and the same label, the system added them to the labeled dataset. The confirmation rate was 87%, meaning 13% of paraphrases introduced semantic drift or ambiguity and were discarded. The net effect was a 2.6x multiplier on labeling throughput for the ten most common question types, which covered 41% of the overall volume. This reduced the total labeling need by roughly 28,000 examples and saved approximately $31,000 in labeling cost.

## Monitoring Cost per Labeled Example and Cost per Accepted Label

You cannot optimize what you do not measure. Most labeling programs track total cost and total labeled examples, but they do not break down cost by task type, annotator tier, or quality outcome. Without that granularity, you cannot identify where money is being wasted or where investment is paying off. The two metrics that matter most are cost per labeled example and cost per accepted label. The first tells you efficiency, the second tells you effective efficiency after accounting for rework and rejection.

A retail company labeling product attributes tracked cost per labeled example at $0.43 across all product categories in early 2025. When they segmented by category, they found apparel cost $0.31 per example, electronics cost $0.48 per example, and home goods cost $0.61 per example. The difference was driven by task complexity and rework rate. Apparel attributes were standardized and rarely ambiguous: size, color, material, brand. Electronics had more variability and more edge cases: compatibility specs, technical certifications, bundled accessories. Home goods had the worst guidelines and the highest rework rate, because the schema had evolved multiple times and the annotators were working from inconsistent versions.

The company invested in cleaning up the home goods guidelines and retraining annotators, which cost approximately $9,000 in labor. After the intervention, home goods cost per labeled example dropped from $0.61 to $0.47, saving $0.14 per example. They labeled 220,000 home goods items over the next six months, which translated to a savings of $30,800. The payback period was one month.

Cost per accepted label adds a quality layer. If you label 1,000 examples at $0.50 each, but 15% are rejected during QA and must be re-labeled, your cost per accepted label is not $0.50; it is approximately $0.59, because you paid for 1,150 labeling events to get 1,000 accepted labels. Tracking this metric exposes hidden waste. The retail company found that one specific annotator had a 29% rejection rate, compared to a team average of 11%. That annotator was fast, which made their cost per labeled example look good, but their cost per accepted label was 24% higher than the team average. The company retrained the annotator, and when performance did not improve, they moved that annotator to a simpler task type where speed mattered more than nuance.

## Building Internal Labeling Capability to Reduce Vendor Dependence

Vendors are flexible and scalable, but they are also expensive and slow to iterate. If you rely entirely on a vendor, you pay a markup for their operational overhead, and you lose the ability to make rapid guideline changes or experimental labeling runs without renegotiating contracts and wait times. Building internal labeling capability, even part-time or on-demand, gives you control and reduces marginal cost for ongoing labeling work.

A SaaS company providing email analytics hired three part-time contractors as internal annotators in mid-2025, each working twenty hours per week at $28 per hour. The total cost was approximately $87,000 per year for the three contractors combined. Before hiring them, the company spent $160,000 per year on vendor labeling at $0.85 per email for 188,000 emails. The internal annotators labeled emails at roughly the same quality but at a much lower marginal cost: their effective cost per email was approximately $0.46, because they labeled 189,000 emails over the year at a fixed salary cost of $87,000. The company saved $73,000 in year one, and the savings compounded in year two because the contractors became more efficient with experience.

Internal annotators also enabled faster iteration. When the company wanted to test a new label type for email urgency, they briefed the internal team in a 30-minute meeting and started labeling the same day. With the vendor, the same change required a guideline update, a contract amendment, a re-training session, and a two-week lead time. The ability to iterate quickly improved the company's model development cycle and reduced time-to-production for new features by an average of eleven days per feature.

The tradeoff is management overhead. Internal annotators require hiring, onboarding, training, performance management, and infrastructure for task assignment and QA. If your labeling volume is low or highly variable, the fixed cost of maintaining an internal team may exceed the savings. The breakeven point depends on your labor market, your task complexity, and your vendor rates, but a reasonable heuristic is that internal labeling becomes cost-effective when you have consistent volume exceeding 50,000 examples per year and when task complexity is high enough that vendor training overhead is a recurring friction point.

You do not have to choose one model exclusively. Many programs use a hybrid approach: internal annotators for core, high-complexity labeling and ongoing maintenance, vendors for surge capacity and low-complexity bulk work. A legal analytics company keeps two full-time expert annotators in-house for labeling precedent-setting case law and complex contracts, and they use a vendor for labeling standard discovery documents and high-volume contract templates. This gives them quality control where it matters most and cost efficiency where volume dominates.

Cost optimization in labeling is not about minimizing spend; it is about maximizing labeled examples per dollar while holding quality constant. Every dollar you save on labeling without sacrificing quality is a dollar you can reinvest in labeling more data, improving guidelines, or building better models. The companies that treat labeling as a strategic operational capability, not just a procurement line item, build cost structures that scale efficiently and quality standards that compound over time. The next challenge is proving that the investment pays off, which requires measuring labeling ROI and connecting label quality to business outcomes.
