# 8.8 — Vendor Security Controls: NDAs, Audit Rights, Data Retention, Cross-Border Rules

In early 2025, a SaaS company building a document classification system contracted with a labeling vendor to annotate 50,000 customer-uploaded contracts. The vendor was US-based, had strong references, and offered competitive pricing. The company signed a standard NDA, transferred the data, and labeling began. Three months into the project, the company's legal team conducted a vendor security review as part of an enterprise customer's due diligence process. They discovered that the vendor had stored the annotated data on AWS servers in a region outside the United States, and had subcontracted 30% of the labeling work to a partner company in Southeast Asia without notifying the customer. The subcontractor had no BAA, no SOC 2 certification, and no contractual relationship with the original customer. The company's enterprise customer, a Fortune 500 financial services firm, immediately terminated the contract, citing unacceptable third-party risk. The SaaS company lost a contract worth 1.9 million dollars annually, and had to halt its annotation pipeline for six weeks while it re-negotiated vendor agreements and migrated data to a compliant infrastructure. The failure was not malicious. The vendor believed it had discretion to optimize its operations. The contract did not prohibit subcontracting or specify data residency requirements. The company assumed those terms were implicit. They were not.

You do not control vendor security through trust. You control it through contracts, verification, and ongoing monitoring. When you send data to an external labeling vendor, you transfer partial custody but not responsibility. If the vendor has a breach, you are still liable under GDPR, HIPAA, and contractual obligations to your customers. The vendor's failure becomes your failure. The only way to manage that risk is to define security requirements explicitly in the vendor agreement, verify compliance before data transfer, and monitor adherence throughout the engagement. The principle is **defense through contract**: every security control you would enforce internally must be mirrored in the vendor agreement, and every contractual obligation must be backed by verification and audit mechanisms. If the contract is silent on subcontracting, the vendor will subcontract. If it is silent on data residency, the vendor will use the cheapest cloud region. If it is silent on retention, the vendor will keep data indefinitely. Silence is interpreted as permission.

The failure mode is treating vendor agreements as boilerplate. Teams download a generic NDA template, fill in the names, and send data. The NDA prohibits disclosure but says nothing about where data is stored, how long it is retained, who has access, whether subcontracting is allowed, or what happens in a breach. Those gaps become liabilities. The correct approach is to treat the vendor agreement as a technical specification, not just a legal formality. You define data handling requirements with the same precision you would use for an internal system design: encryption standards, access control models, retention periods, deletion procedures, audit frequencies, and incident response timelines. If the vendor cannot meet those requirements, you do not use them. If they can meet them but have not documented compliance, you require proof before transferring data.

## NDAs and Confidentiality Agreements: What They Cover and What They Miss

Non-disclosure agreements are the baseline contractual control. They prohibit the vendor from disclosing your data to third parties or using it for purposes other than the contracted labeling work. A standard NDA includes definitions of confidential information, obligations of the receiving party, exclusions for information that is publicly available or independently developed, term and survival clauses, and remedies for breach. These terms are necessary but not sufficient. An NDA prevents the vendor from publishing your data or selling it to competitors, but it does not prevent poor security practices, unauthorized access by vendor employees, or data breaches caused by infrastructure misconfiguration.

The gap is that NDAs are reactive, not preventive. They create liability for disclosure after it happens, but they do not specify controls to prevent disclosure in the first place. A vendor can sign an NDA, store your data in plaintext on an unsecured server, and still be compliant with the NDA as long as they do not intentionally disclose it. If the server is breached, the NDA gives you the right to sue for damages, but it does not reduce the probability of the breach. The solution is to supplement the NDA with a data security addendum that specifies technical and organizational controls. The addendum requires encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, logging, vulnerability scanning, and employee background checks. It defines what constitutes a breach, how the vendor must notify you, and what remediation steps are required.

The data security addendum must address subcontracting explicitly. Many labeling vendors operate as brokers: they accept contracts and then distribute work to subcontractors or freelance annotators. If your NDA prohibits disclosure to third parties, subcontracting is technically a breach. But vendors often interpret subcontracting as operational flexibility, not third-party disclosure. The result is that your data ends up with contractors you never vetted, under security standards you never verified. The fix is a **no-subcontracting clause** unless you provide prior written consent. The clause requires the vendor to disclose any subcontractors, provide evidence of their security controls, and obtain your approval before transferring data. If the vendor cannot deliver labeling volume without subcontracting, you require that all subcontractors sign equivalent NDAs and security addendums, and you reserve the right to audit them.

The enforcement challenge is that NDA breaches are difficult to detect and expensive to litigate. If a vendor discloses your data, you may not know until the data appears in a competitor's product or in a public breach report. By that time, the damage is done. Contractual remedies like liquidated damages or injunctions do not reverse the disclosure. The practical defense is not to rely on NDA enforcement, but to minimize the value of the data you share. You redact PII, you limit the data to the minimum necessary for labeling, and you use short retention periods so the data ages out quickly. The NDA is a legal backstop, not a primary security control.

## Audit Rights: Verifying Vendor Compliance Before and During Engagement

Audit rights give you the contractual authority to verify that the vendor is following the security controls specified in the agreement. Without audit rights, you rely entirely on the vendor's self-reporting. With audit rights, you can independently verify infrastructure, processes, and records. Audit rights must be defined explicitly in the contract, including scope, frequency, notice period, and whether you can use third-party auditors. A strong audit rights clause allows you to inspect the vendor's data storage, access logs, encryption implementation, employee training records, and subcontractor agreements, with reasonable notice and at reasonable intervals such as annually or upon cause.

The initial audit occurs before you transfer data. You send a security questionnaire that asks the vendor to describe their infrastructure, access controls, encryption methods, backup procedures, incident response plan, and compliance certifications. You request documentation such as SOC 2 reports, ISO 27001 certificates, penetration test results, and vulnerability scan reports. If the vendor cannot provide these, you either require them to obtain certifications or you accept the residual risk with documented justification. For high-sensitivity data, self-attestation is not sufficient. You require third-party audit reports and you verify the scope of the audit matches your use case. A SOC 2 Type II report that excludes the labeling platform is not relevant. You need a report that covers the specific systems and processes that will handle your data.

Ongoing audits occur at defined intervals, typically annually, or when triggered by events such as a security incident, a major infrastructure change, or a compliance complaint. The ongoing audit verifies that the vendor has not degraded its security posture since the initial assessment. You review access logs to confirm that only authorized personnel accessed your data. You verify that data has been retained only for the agreed period and deleted afterward. You check that the vendor has applied security patches and has no open critical vulnerabilities. If the vendor uses subcontractors, you audit the subcontractors as well, or you require the vendor to provide subcontractor audit reports.

The challenge is audit cost and logistics. Conducting a full infrastructure audit is expensive and time-consuming, especially if the vendor operates in multiple countries or uses distributed freelance annotators. Many vendors resist invasive audits, arguing that they reveal proprietary processes or create operational disruption. The compromise is to accept third-party certifications as partial substitutes for direct audits, but to retain the right to conduct targeted audits if you detect anomalies. For example, if your access logs show unexpected data access or if the vendor reports a security incident, you invoke your audit rights to investigate. The contract must specify that the vendor will cooperate with audits at no additional cost to you, and that failure to cooperate or evidence of non-compliance is grounds for contract termination.

Some enterprises require continuous audit mechanisms rather than periodic audits. This means the vendor grants you read-only access to their logging and monitoring systems, so you can review access logs, data retention status, and security alerts in real time. This approach is rare in labeling vendor relationships, but it is becoming more common in high-risk industries like healthcare and finance. If you can negotiate continuous access, it reduces the lag between a compliance failure and your detection of it. If you cannot, you rely on periodic audits and incident reporting, which means there is always a window where the vendor could be non-compliant without your knowledge.

## Data Retention and Deletion: Defining Lifecycles and Enforcing Deletion

Data retention defines how long the vendor is permitted to store your data after labeling is complete. The default in many vendor agreements is indefinite retention unless you request deletion. That is incompatible with GDPR Article 5, which requires that personal data be kept only as long as necessary, and with HIPAA's minimum necessary standard. The correct approach is to define a retention period in the contract: for example, 30 days after final label delivery, or 90 days after project completion. After that period, the vendor must delete all copies of the data, including backups, logs, and derived artifacts.

Deletion must be verifiable. The contract requires the vendor to provide a certificate of destruction that lists what was deleted, when, and by whom. The certificate is not a mere formality. It is an auditable record that you retain as proof of compliance. If you later face a regulatory audit or a data subject access request, you can demonstrate that the data was deleted per the agreed schedule. If the vendor cannot provide a certificate, you assume the data still exists, and you require immediate remediation.

The operational challenge is that many vendors use shared infrastructure where customer data is commingled in databases, object stores, or model training pipelines. Deleting your data without affecting other customers' data requires careful partitioning and metadata tagging. If the vendor has not designed their system for per-customer deletion, they may claim that deletion is technically infeasible. That is not acceptable. The vendor's infrastructure design is their responsibility, and their inability to delete data is a disqualifying security gap. You identify this gap during the initial vendor assessment, and you either require the vendor to implement deletion support or you choose a different vendor.

Backup retention is a related issue. Many vendors take daily backups with long retention periods, such as 90 days or one year. If the vendor deletes production data but retains it in backups, the data is not actually deleted. The contract must specify that deletion includes backups, or it must define a backup retention period that aligns with your compliance requirements. For example, the vendor may retain backups for 30 days for disaster recovery, but after 30 days, all backups containing your data are also purged. You verify backup deletion by reviewing the vendor's backup logs or by requesting confirmation during audits.

Data retention policies must also address model artifacts. If the vendor uses your labeled data to train internal models or benchmarks, those models are derived artifacts that may contain information about your data. GDPR considers this a form of data retention. The contract must prohibit the vendor from training models on your data unless you explicitly permit it, and if you do permit it, the contract must specify whether the model is considered your property or the vendor's, and how long the model can be retained. The safest approach is to prohibit all secondary use: the vendor labels your data and returns the labels, and all copies of the data are deleted per the retention schedule. The vendor derives no other value from the engagement.

## Cross-Border Data Transfer Rules: GDPR, EU AI Act, and Adequacy Decisions

Cross-border data transfers are a major compliance risk in labeling workflows. If your data originates in the European Union and you send it to a vendor in the United States, India, or the Philippines, you are subject to GDPR Chapter V, which restricts transfers of personal data to countries outside the EU. The same restrictions apply under the EU AI Act for training data used in high-risk AI systems. The legal mechanisms for lawful transfers include adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, and derogations for specific situations. Adequacy decisions exist for a limited set of countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, and as of 2024, a revised EU-US Data Privacy Framework. If your vendor is in a country without an adequacy decision, you must use Standard Contractual Clauses.

Standard Contractual Clauses are template agreements approved by the European Commission that impose data protection obligations on the data importer. The clauses require the vendor to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, to process data only for the specified purpose, to notify you of government access requests, and to allow audits. The clauses also include specific provisions for onward transfers to subcontractors, which require that subcontractors sign equivalent clauses. If your vendor is in the United States, the clauses must be supplemented by a transfer impact assessment that evaluates whether US surveillance laws create risks to the data, and what supplementary measures can mitigate those risks. This is a requirement introduced by the Schrems II decision in 2020 and reinforced in subsequent guidance from the European Data Protection Board.

The transfer impact assessment is not a checkbox exercise. It is a documented analysis of the vendor's jurisdiction, the nature of the data, the likelihood of government access requests, and the effectiveness of technical safeguards like encryption, pseudonymization, and access controls. If the assessment concludes that the data is at risk, you must apply supplementary measures such as end-to-end encryption, data minimization, or splitting data processing across multiple jurisdictions to reduce exposure. If supplementary measures are not sufficient, the transfer is not lawful, and you must either process the data within the EU or choose a vendor in an adequate country.

The EU AI Act introduces additional transfer restrictions for training data used in high-risk AI systems. Article 10 requires that training data be relevant, representative, and free of errors and biases, and that data governance and management practices ensure data quality. If you transfer training data to a non-EU vendor for labeling, you must ensure that the vendor's practices comply with Article 10. This includes documenting data provenance, labeling quality controls, and bias mitigation measures. The Act does not prohibit transfers, but it requires that you verify and document compliance, which increases the due diligence burden on vendor selection.

The practical implication is that vendor location matters. If you have data subject to GDPR or the EU AI Act, you should prioritize vendors in the EU or in adequate countries. If you use a vendor outside those jurisdictions, you must implement SCCs, conduct a transfer impact assessment, and apply supplementary measures. Many US-based labeling vendors now offer EU data residency options, where data is stored and processed entirely within EU regions. This avoids the transfer issue, but you must verify that data does not leave the EU at any point, including for backups, logging, or subcontractor access. The contract must specify data residency, and you must audit compliance.

## Vendor Assessment Frameworks: Scoring Security and Compliance Before Onboarding

Vendor assessment is the process you run before signing a contract and transferring data. The assessment evaluates the vendor's security controls, compliance certifications, data handling practices, and financial stability. The output is a risk score that determines whether the vendor is approved, approved with conditions, or rejected. The assessment is not a one-time event. You repeat it annually or when the vendor makes significant changes to infrastructure or processes. The assessment framework is documented and applied consistently across all vendors to ensure fair comparison.

The framework includes multiple evaluation dimensions. Security infrastructure covers encryption, access controls, logging, network segmentation, and vulnerability management. You ask the vendor to describe their architecture, provide evidence of encryption in transit and at rest, and share vulnerability scan reports. You verify that access is role-based, that logs are immutable and retained for at least one year, and that the vendor has a formal patch management process. Compliance certifications cover SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA compliance, and GDPR readiness. You request copies of certification reports and verify that the scope includes the labeling platform. You also check the certification date: a SOC 2 report from three years ago is not current.

Data handling practices cover data residency, retention, deletion, and subcontracting. You ask the vendor to specify where data will be stored, how long it will be retained, how deletion is implemented, and whether subcontracting is used. You review their data retention policy and deletion procedures, and you require written confirmation that data will be deleted per your specified schedule. If the vendor uses subcontractors, you require disclosure of subcontractor identities, locations, and security controls. You evaluate whether the subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary vendor. If they do not, you either prohibit subcontracting or require the vendor to upgrade subcontractor security.

Operational stability covers the vendor's financial health, business continuity plan, and incident response capability. You check public records or credit reports to verify that the vendor is financially stable and unlikely to shut down mid-project. You review their business continuity plan to ensure they can recover from infrastructure failures or disasters without losing your data. You review their incident response plan to ensure they can detect, contain, and remediate security incidents within acceptable timelines. The plan should include notification procedures, so you are alerted within 24 to 72 hours of any incident that affects your data.

The assessment results in a scorecard that rates the vendor on each dimension: green for compliant, yellow for compliant with conditions, red for non-compliant. Conditions might include requiring the vendor to obtain a certification, implement a missing control, or provide additional documentation. You approve the vendor only if all critical dimensions are green or yellow with acceptable remediation plans. If any critical dimension is red, you reject the vendor. The scorecard is stored as a record of your due diligence, and it is updated each time you reassess the vendor.

## Ongoing Compliance Monitoring: Alerts, Incident Reporting, and Contract Reviews

Vendor compliance is not static. A vendor that was compliant at contract signing may become non-compliant due to infrastructure changes, staff turnover, acquisition, or security incidents. Ongoing monitoring detects these changes and triggers remediation. Monitoring includes automated alerts, periodic incident reports, and annual contract reviews. The goal is to identify compliance drift before it becomes a breach.

Automated alerts are triggered by anomalies in access logs, retention status, or security events. If your access logs show that a vendor employee accessed your data outside normal business hours, or accessed a volume of records inconsistent with their assigned tasks, the alert notifies your security team. If the vendor's data retention report shows that data has not been deleted per the agreed schedule, the alert triggers a follow-up. If the vendor reports a security incident that affects your data, the alert escalates to your incident response team. These alerts rely on data feeds from the vendor, either through API access to their logging system or through periodic reports. The vendor contract must require these data feeds and define the format and frequency.

Incident reporting is the process by which the vendor notifies you of security events that may affect your data. The contract defines what constitutes a reportable incident: unauthorized access, data breach, infrastructure failure, subcontractor change, or government access request. The contract specifies notification timelines, such as 24 hours for critical incidents and 72 hours for lower-severity events. The notification includes incident details, affected data, root cause analysis, and remediation steps. You review each incident report to determine whether the vendor's response was adequate, whether the incident indicates a systemic weakness, and whether you need to take additional action such as pausing data transfers or conducting an audit.

Annual contract reviews are scheduled checkpoints where you reassess the vendor relationship. You review the vendor's performance over the past year, including labeling quality, turnaround time, incident history, and compliance status. You verify that the vendor's certifications are still current, that their infrastructure has not changed in ways that affect security, and that they have not subcontracted to new parties without your approval. You also review whether your own data handling requirements have changed due to new regulations, customer contracts, or internal policy updates. If requirements have changed, you update the vendor agreement to reflect the new standards. The annual review is documented, and the updated agreement is signed by both parties.

The enforcement mechanism is contract termination. If the vendor fails to meet security or compliance obligations, and remediation is not feasible or timely, you terminate the contract and migrate to a different vendor. Termination clauses must allow you to exit without penalty if the vendor breaches security terms. The contract also requires the vendor to return or delete all data upon termination, and to provide a certificate of destruction. You verify deletion through a final audit or through access to deletion logs. If the vendor refuses to delete data or cannot provide proof, you escalate through legal channels, but your primary defense is to have selected a reputable vendor with strong operational practices in the first place.

Vendor security controls are not a post-contract concern. They are a pre-contract decision criterion. You evaluate security before signing, you enforce security through contract terms, and you monitor security throughout the engagement. The vendor's security posture is as important as their labeling quality and pricing. A vendor that delivers high-quality labels but has weak security is a liability, not an asset. The teams that select labeling vendors must include security, legal, and compliance stakeholders, not just machine learning engineers. The selection process must evaluate contracts, certifications, and infrastructure with the same rigor applied to production cloud vendors. If you would not host your production database with a vendor, you should not send them your training data.

The next subchapter examines how to integrate labeling workflows with evaluation pipelines, ensuring that labeled data flows smoothly into model testing, performance tracking, and continuous validation loops.
