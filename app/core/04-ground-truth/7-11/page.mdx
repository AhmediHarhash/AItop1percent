# 7.11 — Ground Truth Governance: Access, Retention, Redaction & Audit

I got a panicked call from a VP of Engineering at a healthcare company. Their ground truth repository had been breached — not by external attackers, but by an intern who'd been given "read-only" access that turned out to be full access. The intern didn't do anything malicious. They just browsed around out of curiosity.

But that browsing exposed them to hundreds of real patient queries and medical information that they were not authorized to see. HIPAA violation. Potential fines. Required breach notification. Audit from their compliance team. All because nobody had thought about access control for ground truth artifacts.

"It's just examples and rubrics," the VP said. "We never thought of it as sensitive data."

But ground truth is sensitive data. It contains real user queries, including things users said in confidence. It contains business logic and competitive intelligence. It contains compliance decisions that could be liability if mishandled. It contains expert judgments that might be wrong and need to be updated without creating a permanent record of error.

If you skip governing ground truth properly, here's what happens: privacy breaches, compliance violations, intellectual property leaks, inability to meet audit requirements, and the nightmare scenario of having to explain to regulators why sensitive data was accessible to people who shouldn't have seen it.

Let me walk you through what ground truth governance actually means and how to do it right.

## Why Ground Truth Needs Governance

Ground truth artifacts aren't just documentation. They're operational data that contains sensitive information and drives business-critical decisions. They need the same governance you apply to production data, code, and other critical assets.

### Regulatory Requirements

If you operate in regulated industries or jurisdictions, ground truth governance isn't optional.

HIPAA (healthcare in the US): ground truth containing protected health information must be access-controlled, audited, and handled according to PHI rules.

GDPR (EU): ground truth containing personal data requires data processing agreements, retention policies, right to deletion compliance.

EU AI Act (high-risk AI systems): requires documentation of ground truth, including how it was created, validated, and maintained — with audit trails.

SOC 2 (common for SaaS): requires access controls and audit logs for systems that affect service quality and security.

Financial regulations (SOX, PCI-DSS): ground truth for financial AI systems needs controls to ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.

If your ground truth governance doesn't meet these requirements, you're non-compliant before your AI even runs.

### Business Sensitivity

Beyond regulatory requirements, ground truth contains competitive intelligence.

Your rubrics reflect your quality philosophy and competitive positioning. If competitors see them, they understand your strategy.

Your examples might include customer queries that reveal market needs, product gaps, or business intelligence.

Your evaluation processes might be proprietary methods that give you competitive advantage.

Inappropriate access could mean leaking business-sensitive information to competitors or unauthorized parties.

### Operational Integrity

Ground truth drives AI behavior. If someone maliciously or accidentally corrupts ground truth, they corrupt your AI's optimization target.

Imagine someone with write access to ground truth subtly changes criteria to favor certain outcomes. Your AI optimizes for those biased criteria. You ship biased behavior without realizing it.

Or imagine someone deletes critical safety criteria. Your evaluations stop checking for safety. Unsafe outputs pass review.

Access control and audit trails prevent both malicious corruption and honest mistakes that could have serious consequences.

## Access Control: Who Can Do What

Not everyone should have the same access to ground truth. Implement role-based access control.

### Read Access

Who should be able to view ground truth?

Full access: People who need to understand quality standards to do their job — evaluators, quality engineers, product managers, compliance officers.

Partial access: People who need to see some ground truth but not all — engineers might see technical criteria but not business-sensitive rubrics.

No access: People who don't need it for their role.

Default to least privilege: only grant access when there's a clear need.

For sensitive ground truth (containing PII, PHI, or business-critical information), require additional authorization even for those who normally have read access.

### Write Access

Who should be able to modify ground truth?

This should be a smaller group than read access. Typically:

Ground truth owners and maintainers.

Domain experts authorized to contribute to specific sections.

Automated systems that update ground truth programmatically (with appropriate controls).

Write access should require authentication and should be logged. Every change should be attributable to a person or system.

### Approval Access

For critical ground truth (compliance-related, safety-related, company-wide standards), implement approval workflows.

Someone can propose changes (write access), but changes don't take effect until approved by an authorized approver.

This prevents accidental or unauthorized changes to critical standards from immediately affecting production.

### Administrative Access

Who can change permissions, create new ground truth repositories, delete ground truth?

This should be the smallest group — typically ground truth platform administrators and senior quality leadership.

Admin actions should require dual authorization for critical operations.

## Retention Policies: How Long to Keep What

Ground truth accumulates over time. You can't keep everything forever. You need retention policies.

### Active Ground Truth

Current, actively used ground truth should be retained indefinitely while it's in use.

Even after you update to a new version, keep old versions for a retention period.

### Historical Versions

How long to keep superseded versions?

Regulatory considerations: Some regulations require keeping evaluation records and the ground truth they were evaluated against for specific periods (often 3-7 years).

Audit considerations: Keep versions used during any period that might be audited until the audit period expires.

Learning considerations: Historical versions show evolution of your quality standards — valuable for understanding long-term trends.

Common retention: 3-7 years for compliance-driven retention, indefinite for learning-driven retention if you have the storage.

### Expired or Deprecated Ground Truth

When ground truth is no longer relevant and has passed its retention period, archive or delete it.

Archival: move to cold storage, remove from active systems, but keep for potential future reference.

Deletion: permanently remove, including backups. Required when ground truth contains data subject to right-to-deletion requests (GDPR) or when retention period expires.

### Automated Retention Management

Manually managing retention doesn't scale. Automate it:

Tag ground truth with retention class (regulatory, historical, temporary).

Set retention periods based on class.

Automated jobs move expired ground truth to archive or deletion queues.

Human review before deletion to catch anything that should be retained longer.

## Redaction: Handling PII and Sensitive Data

Ground truth often starts with real user examples. Real examples often contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data.

### What to Redact

In ground truth examples, redact:

Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses.

Account numbers, IDs, credentials.

Health information (symptoms, diagnoses, medications).

Financial information (account balances, transactions).

Any information that could identify individuals.

Business-sensitive information if ground truth is shared outside your organization.

### Redaction Approaches

Manual redaction: humans review examples and replace sensitive information with placeholders.

Pro: very accurate. Con: doesn't scale, slow.

Automated redaction: tools detect and redact PII automatically.

Pro: scales well. Con: might miss some PII or over-redact, removing contextually important information.

Hybrid: automated redaction with human review of edge cases.

Best balance of accuracy and scale for most organizations.

### Redaction vs. Synthetic Data

Alternative to redacting real examples: use synthetic examples that never contained PII.

Generate examples that represent realistic scenarios but aren't derived from real users.

This avoids PII concerns entirely but requires effort to ensure synthetic examples are representative.

Many teams use a mix: real examples (redacted) for authenticity, synthetic examples to fill gaps or replace particularly sensitive real examples.

### Verification

After redaction, verify that PII was actually removed.

Automated scanning for patterns (emails, phone numbers, common names).

Sample human review to catch things automation missed.

If ground truth will be shared externally, extra verification before release.

## Audit Trails: Who Changed What, When, and Why

Every change to ground truth should be logged in an audit trail.

### What to Log

For each change:

What changed: which ground truth artifact, which section, what the change was.

Who changed it: user identity, role, authorization level.

When: timestamp of the change.

Why: change reason or ticket/issue number linking to context.

What version resulted: version number after the change.

Whether the change was approved (if approval required) and by whom.

### Using Git for Audit

If your ground truth is in Git, you get much of this automatically:

Commits show what changed and when.

Commit messages explain why.

Author information shows who.

Tags show versions.

Git blame shows who last modified each line.

Git makes audit trails natural for code-like ground truth.

### Using Databases for Audit

If ground truth is in a database, implement audit tables:

Every change to ground truth writes to an audit log table.

Audit table is append-only — even admins can't delete audit records.

Regular exports to immutable storage for long-term retention.

Audit queries can show: "What did ground truth look like on date X?" or "Who changed this criterion and when?"

### Audit Trail Retention

Audit trails should be retained longer than ground truth itself.

Even after you delete old ground truth, keep the audit trail showing that it existed, was used, and was then deleted.

This proves compliance with retention policies and provides accountability.

## The Four Questions Every Audit Asks

When auditors (internal or external) review your ground truth governance, they ask four questions. You need good answers.

### Question 1: Who Had Access?

Auditors want to see access control lists showing who could read, write, and approve ground truth at any point in time.

They want to verify that access was appropriate to roles and that inappropriate people didn't have access.

If you discover during an audit that you can't prove who had access to what, that's a finding (a nice word for "you failed this part").

### Question 2: What Changed and Why?

Auditors want to see change history. They pick random dates and ask: "Show me what your ground truth looked like on this date. Show me what changed between this date and this other date. Explain why those changes were made."

Without audit trails, you can't answer. That's a finding.

### Question 3: How Did You Ensure Quality?

Auditors want to see that changes went through review and approval, that ground truth was tested before deployment, that you have processes to prevent errors.

If your answer is "anyone could change anything anytime," that's a finding.

### Question 4: How Did You Handle Sensitive Data?

For ground truth containing PII, PHI, or regulated data, auditors want to see:

How you identified sensitive data in ground truth.

How you protected it (access control, encryption).

How you ensured it was only retained as long as necessary.

How you handled data subject rights (access requests, deletion requests).

If you can't demonstrate appropriate data handling, that's a finding and potentially a regulatory violation.

## Governance for Different Maturity Levels

Ground truth governance scales with maturity.

### Early Stage (Maturity Level 1-2)

Basic controls:

Ground truth in a shared location with some access control (not everyone in the company can access).

No PII in examples — redact before adding to ground truth.

Someone designated as owner even if process is informal.

Changes tracked in version control even if not formally audited.

### Mid Stage (Maturity Level 3)

Formal controls:

Role-based access control implemented.

All changes logged with audit trails.

Regular review of access permissions (quarterly).

PII redaction process documented and followed.

Retention policy defined even if not automated.

### Advanced Stage (Maturity Level 4-5)

Comprehensive governance:

Automated access control with regular recertification.

Complete audit trails with tamper-proof logging.

Automated retention management.

Encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive ground truth.

Regular compliance audits of ground truth governance.

Documented data processing agreements if ground truth contains personal data.

## The Ground Truth Data Processing Agreement

If your ground truth contains personal data (very common — examples derived from real users), you might need data processing agreements.

### When Required

GDPR: if ground truth contains EU residents' personal data and you share it with third parties (contractors, vendors, annotation services).

Other privacy laws: CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), and similar laws have similar requirements.

### What It Covers

A data processing agreement specifies:

What personal data is in ground truth.

Why it's necessary (what purpose it serves).

Who has access and under what conditions.

How it's protected.

How long it's retained.

How data subjects' rights are honored (access requests, deletion requests).

What happens when the agreement ends (data return or deletion).

### Ground Truth as a Data Asset

This might feel like overkill for "just examples," but legally, ground truth containing personal data is a data asset subject to data protection law.

Treat it accordingly: formal agreements, documented processes, audit trails, data subject rights procedures.

## The Breach Response Plan

What if, despite your controls, ground truth is accessed by unauthorized parties or accidentally leaked?

### Detection

How do you know if unauthorized access happened?

Access logs showing unusual access patterns.

Alerts when sensitive ground truth is accessed by unexpected users.

Regular access reviews that might catch past unauthorized access.

### Assessment

If unauthorized access is detected:

What ground truth was accessed?

What sensitive information did it contain?

Who accessed it and under what circumstances?

Was it malicious, accidental, or authorized-but-inappropriate?

What's the potential harm?

### Response

Based on assessment:

Immediate: revoke unauthorized access, prevent further exposure.

Investigation: understand how it happened and what was compromised.

Notification: if breach includes PII/PHI, you might have legal obligation to notify affected individuals and regulators.

Remediation: fix the vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access.

Documentation: document the incident, response, and remediation for compliance and learning.

### Prevention

Update your governance based on what you learned:

Add controls to prevent similar incidents.

Update access policies if they were too permissive.

Increase monitoring if detection was slow.

Train team if incident was due to human error.

## Making Governance Sustainable

Governance can feel like bureaucracy. The key is making it sustainable — rigorous enough to be effective, lightweight enough to not slow everything down.

### Automate What You Can

Access control: managed by identity systems with role-based permissions.

Audit logging: automatic for all changes.

Retention: automated archival and deletion based on policies.

PII detection: automated scanning to flag potential issues.

Humans focus on decisions (who should have access? what retention period?). Systems enforce those decisions.

### Integrate Into Workflows

Don't make governance separate from work. Build it in:

Ground truth changes go through pull requests with automatic logging.

Approval workflows are part of the change process, not a separate step.

Access reviews happen during quarterly team reviews, not as special events.

### Make It Visible

Teams comply better when governance is visible, not hidden:

Dashboards show who has access to what.

Audit trails are easily searchable, not buried in logs.

Compliance status is on team dashboards: "All ground truth has up-to-date retention policies: yes/no"

Visibility creates accountability and catches issues early.

## Governance as Enabler, Not Blocker

Good governance doesn't slow you down — it enables you to move fast safely.

With proper access control, you can confidently give people access knowing they can't accidentally break things.

With audit trails, you can make changes confidently knowing you can roll back if needed.

With retention policies, you can keep what you need and delete what you don't, keeping ground truth manageable.

With data protection measures, you can use real user examples to create authentic ground truth without legal risk.

Governance done right is infrastructure for quality and compliance, not overhead that gets in the way.

In the final section of this chapter, we'll tackle a special case of ground truth: creating ground truth for your evaluators when you use LLM-as-judge systems. How do you ensure your AI judges are reliable? You need ground truth for the judges themselves.
