# Chapter 2 — Risk-Tiered Reference Standards

Not every AI product carries the same stakes. A creative writing assistant and a medical diagnosis tool don't need the same quality bar — and treating them the same way is one of the most expensive mistakes teams make.

Risk-tiered reference standards give you a framework for matching your ground truth rigor to the actual consequences of getting it wrong. Too strict for low-stakes products, and you'll never ship. Too loose for high-stakes ones, and you'll ship something dangerous.

This chapter walks you through the four tolerance tiers, how to map your product to the right one, what happens when tasks span multiple tiers, and the regulatory landscape that shapes all of it in 2026.
