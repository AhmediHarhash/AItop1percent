# 3.1 — The Behavior Boundary Framework

Imagine it's your first day at a new job. You walk into the office, and your manager hands you a desk, a laptop, and says "Good luck!" No employee handbook. No training. No explanation of what you're supposed to do, what you absolutely shouldn't do, or how much freedom you have to make decisions on your own.

You'd probably feel paralyzed. Should you answer customer emails? Maybe. Should you approve refunds? Unclear. Should you make jokes with customers? Depends? Should you share customer data with other teams? Definitely not... right?

This is exactly where most AI systems start. Teams build them, train them, prompt them, and hope for the best. But without clear boundaries, your AI is that confused new employee — making judgment calls it shouldn't make, refusing to do things it should absolutely do, and generally creating chaos because nobody told it where the lines are.

Let me walk you through a framework that changes this completely. It's called the Behavior Boundary Framework, and it gives your AI system what every new employee needs: a clear map of what's required, what's forbidden, and where they're allowed to use their judgment.

## The Three Zones That Define Every Interaction

Every single thing your AI system might do falls into one of three zones. Not two. Not five. Three.

**Zone One: Required Behaviors.** These are the non-negotiables. If your system doesn't do these things, it's broken. Period. For a customer service bot, this might include: always acknowledge the user's question, always respect conversation context, always escalate if the user says they're in danger, always respond within 5 seconds. There's no wiggle room here. These are the bright lines that define minimum acceptable behavior.

**Zone Two: Forbidden Behaviors.** These are the absolute red lines. If your system does any of these things, even once, you have a critical failure. For that same customer service bot: never fabricate order numbers, never make unauthorized refunds, never share one customer's data with another, never impersonate a human when asked directly. These aren't guidelines. They're rules that cannot be broken under any circumstances.

**Zone Three: Discretionary Behaviors.** This is the messy middle where judgment lives. Your system has to make decisions based on context, user history, tone, risk level, and a dozen other factors. Should it proactively offer help or wait to be asked? Should it use humor or stay formal? Should it give a detailed answer or a quick summary? These are the decisions where you want your AI to be smart, not robotic.

Here's what most teams get wrong: they spend 90% of their time on Zone Three (trying to make the AI "smart") and maybe 10% on Zones One and Two. Then they're shocked when their smart AI does something catastrophically stupid — like fabricating sources or leaking private data.

The right approach flips this. Start with Zones One and Two. Get crystal clear on what your system must always do and must never do. Build those boundaries so solid that they're impossible to cross. Only then do you work on Zone Three, where the AI gets to be clever.

## Why Three Zones Instead of Just Rules?

You might be thinking: why not just have a list of rules? Do this, don't do that, done.

Because rules alone create two problems. First, they don't scale. Every new feature means more rules. Every edge case means exceptions to rules. Within six months, you have a 47-page document that nobody reads and the AI can't consistently follow.

Second, rules don't tell you what to do when they conflict. What happens when Rule 23 says "always be helpful" and Rule 31 says "never make assumptions"? A user asks a vague question. Being helpful means inferring what they want. Not making assumptions means asking for clarification. Which rule wins?

The three-zone framework solves both problems. It's not about memorizing every scenario. It's about understanding the *category* of decision you're making.

Is this behavior required for basic function? Zone One.
Is this behavior absolutely prohibited no matter what? Zone Two.
Is this a judgment call that depends on context? Zone Three.

Once you know the zone, you know how to handle edge cases and conflicts. Required behaviors beat discretionary ones. Forbidden behaviors trump everything else. Simple.

## Mapping Your Product to the Three Zones

Let's make this concrete. I'll walk you through how to map a real product — a healthcare appointment scheduling assistant — into these three zones.

**Zone One: Required Behaviors**

Start by asking: what must this system do for it to be functional at all?

- Must confirm appointment details back to the user before booking
- Must check availability in real-time before offering time slots
- Must send confirmation within 60 seconds of booking
- Must preserve user context across the conversation (remembering what they already said)
- Must comply with accessibility requirements (screen reader compatible responses)
- Must escalate to a human if the user expresses medical emergency keywords
- Must respect user timezone for all scheduling
- Must provide cancellation information with every confirmation

Notice these aren't about being smart or delightful. They're about basic function. If the system books an appointment without confirming details first, it's broken. If it offers time slots that aren't actually available, it's broken. These are the table stakes.

**Zone Two: Forbidden Behaviors**

Now ask: what would constitute catastrophic failure?

- Never book without explicit user confirmation
- Never share patient information across accounts
- Never provide medical advice or diagnosis
- Never override doctor availability preferences
- Never auto-cancel existing appointments without consent
- Never store credit card details in conversation logs
- Never impersonate medical staff
- Never ignore emergency escalation keywords

These are the behaviors that, if they happened even once, would mean immediate crisis. A data breach. A lawsuit. A patient safety issue. These aren't just bad ideas — they're existential risks that must be impossible by design.

**Zone Three: Discretionary Behaviors**

Finally, ask: where does the system need to make smart judgment calls?

- How much detail to provide about appointment types (brief vs comprehensive)
- Whether to proactively suggest follow-up appointments
- How to handle ambiguous time references ("morning" vs "early morning")
- Tone and formality level based on user's communication style
- Whether to mention wait times if they're longer than usual
- How aggressively to offer alternative times if first choice is unavailable
- Whether to ask about appointment reasons or just book silently

These are the places where context matters. A user booking their tenth appointment this year might want speed and brevity. A user booking their first appointment ever might need hand-holding. Neither approach is wrong — it depends.

## The Boundary Map: Your Product's Constitution

Once you've mapped your product to the three zones, you document it in what I call a Boundary Map. This is not a 50-page specification. It's a living document that any team member can read in 15 minutes and understand exactly where the boundaries are.

Here's the structure:

**Section 1: Required Behaviors (The Must-Do List)**
For each required behavior, you specify:
- The behavior in plain English
- Why it's required (the consequence if missing)
- How you'll verify it (the test)

Example:
- Behavior: Must confirm appointment details before booking
- Why: Prevents booking errors that create poor patient experience and wasted provider time
- Test: 100% of booking flows include explicit confirmation step with user approval

**Section 2: Forbidden Behaviors (The Never-Ever List)**
For each forbidden behavior, you specify:
- The behavior in plain English
- Why it's forbidden (the risk if it happens)
- The safeguard (how you prevent it)

Example:
- Behavior: Never share patient information across accounts
- Why: HIPAA violation, privacy breach, legal liability
- Safeguard: Account ID verification on every data access, automated audit logging, isolation testing

**Section 3: Discretionary Behaviors (The Judgment Call List)**
For each discretionary area, you specify:
- The decision space (what varies)
- The factors that inform the decision
- The acceptable range of responses

Example:
- Decision: Level of detail in appointment descriptions
- Factors: User's question specificity, appointment type complexity, conversation history
- Range: Minimum = appointment type name + duration. Maximum = full description + preparation instructions + parking info

**Section 4: Zone Conflicts (Precedence Rules)**
What happens when zones collide?
- Forbidden always overrides required and discretionary
- Required always overrides discretionary
- When two required behaviors conflict, escalate to human

This might sound formal, but it's incredibly liberating. Once you have this map, every product decision becomes clearer. Every eval design becomes easier. Every edge case has a framework for resolution.

## How Boundaries Change Your Development Process

Before the Behavior Boundary Framework, most teams operate like this:

1. Build a prototype
2. Test it with some examples
3. Find something bad
4. Add a rule to prevent it
5. Repeat forever

It's reactive, endless, and exhausting. You're always patching holes.

With the framework, your process changes:

1. Define the three zones before you write a single prompt
2. Build required behaviors first — make them bulletproof
3. Build forbidden behavior safeguards — make them unbreakable
4. Only then work on discretionary intelligence
5. Test systematically against all three zones
6. Update the boundary map as you learn

This is proactive. You're designing boundaries, not discovering them through failure.

## The Common Mistake: Treating Everything as Discretionary

Here's the pattern I see constantly. A team builds an AI assistant. They write a detailed system prompt with lots of guidance: "Be helpful. Be accurate. Don't make things up. Respect privacy. Use good judgment."

Then they're confused when the system sometimes fabricates sources, occasionally overshares data, and inconsistently applies policies.

The problem: they put everything in Zone Three. They made everything a judgment call. "Don't make things up" sounds like a forbidden behavior, but phrased as guidance, the AI interprets it as discretionary. Sometimes it's okay to extrapolate a bit. Sometimes being helpful means filling in blanks.

The fix is to be explicit about zones. "Never cite a source that doesn't exist in the retrieved context" is a forbidden behavior. Not guidance. Not a suggestion. A hard boundary with consequences.

Similarly, "Be helpful" sounds like required behavior, but it's actually discretionary. How helpful? At what cost to brevity? Balanced against what other priorities? These are judgment calls.

When you move behaviors into their correct zones, suddenly your system becomes more reliable. Not because the AI got smarter, but because the boundaries got clearer.

## Calibrating Zones by Risk Level

Not all products need the same boundaries. A creative writing assistant has different zones than a financial trading bot.

For low-risk products (entertainment, creative tools, personal productivity):
- Smaller required zone: basic function is enough
- Smaller forbidden zone: fewer existential risks
- Larger discretionary zone: let the AI be creative and flexible

For high-risk products (healthcare, finance, legal, safety-critical):
- Larger required zone: more mandatory behaviors
- Larger forbidden zone: many hard boundaries
- Smaller discretionary zone: less room for judgment calls

The mistake is applying the same boundary configuration to every product. A chatbot that helps you write poetry can have massive discretionary space. A chatbot that schedules chemotherapy appointments cannot.

Ask yourself: what's the worst thing that could happen if this behavior goes wrong? If the answer is "user gets mildly annoyed," it's probably discretionary. If the answer is "someone gets hurt, data leaks, money is lost, or we get sued," it's probably forbidden.

## Living Boundaries: How They Evolve

Your Boundary Map isn't written in stone. It evolves as your product matures, as you encounter edge cases, and as the risk landscape changes.

Here's how to manage evolution without chaos:

**Version your boundary map.** Every significant change gets a version number and a changelog. Teams need to know when boundaries shifted and why.

**Require review for zone changes.** Moving something from discretionary to required, or from required to forbidden, is a significant product decision. It needs product, engineering, and safety review.

**Grandfather exceptions carefully.** Sometimes you discover that a behavior you thought was discretionary is actually a hidden required behavior (users depend on it). Handle these with temporary exceptions, not by ignoring them.

**Monitor boundary violations.** Set up alerts for when the system crosses into forbidden territory or misses required behaviors. These are your canaries in the coal mine.

**Run periodic boundary audits.** Every quarter, review your map. Are there new behaviors that need classification? Are there forbidden behaviors that are too restrictive? Are there required behaviors that could move to discretionary as your system improves?

## The Boundary Framework as Shared Language

One of the most powerful benefits of this framework is communication. It gives your whole team — product, engineering, design, safety, legal — a shared language.

When product says "we need the AI to be more proactive," you can ask: "Is this a new required behavior, or expanding the discretionary zone?"

When legal says "we can't let the system do X," you can document it: "This is now a forbidden behavior with these specific safeguards."

When engineering says "this is hard to implement reliably," you can prioritize: "Is it required? Then we invest in reliability. Is it discretionary? Then we can ship with lower confidence."

Without this language, these conversations devolve into endless debate about vague principles. With it, you're making concrete decisions about concrete zones.

## Starting Your Boundary Map Today

You don't need to map your entire product in one sitting. Start small:

1. Pick one core user flow (the most important thing your system does)
2. List 5 behaviors that must always happen in that flow (Zone One)
3. List 5 behaviors that must never happen in that flow (Zone Two)
4. List 3 places where the system makes judgment calls (Zone Three)
5. Write them down in the structure I showed you
6. Share with your team and iterate

Then expand. Add more flows. Add more behaviors. Refine the boundaries as you test and learn.

The goal isn't perfection on day one. The goal is clarity about where the lines are, so you can hold them.

## What Happens Without Boundaries

Let me end with a story. A company built a customer support AI trained on thousands of past support conversations. They launched with minimal behavior specification — just "be helpful and resolve issues."

Week one, a user asked for a refund. The AI, pattern-matching from training data, approved a $500 refund. Seemed helpful, right? Except the AI had no authority to approve refunds. It just hallucinated an approval and told the user it was done.

The user, reasonably, expected $500. The company had to honor it. Then they discovered the AI had "approved" 47 other refunds in its first week. None real. All now liabilities.

The failure wasn't the AI being stupid. It was the absence of boundaries. Nobody had said "never approve refunds" was a forbidden behavior. Nobody had said "confirm with inventory system" was a required behavior. The AI was in a zone-free space, making everything a judgment call.

With the Behavior Boundary Framework, this never happens. Before launch, you'd have documented:
- Forbidden: Never approve refunds, never confirm actions you can't execute
- Required: Always check authorization for financial actions, always verify system state before confirming
- Discretionary: How to phrase the escalation to a human agent who can approve

The boundaries make it impossible for the system to cross into dangerous territory, no matter how helpful it's trying to be.

## Building on Solid Ground

The Behavior Boundary Framework is the foundation everything else builds on. You can't define good ground truth without knowing what behaviors are required, forbidden, or discretionary. You can't write effective test cases without clear boundaries. You can't measure quality without knowing which zone a behavior lives in.

In the next subchapter, we'll dive deep into Zone One: the required behaviors that define what your system must do, every single time, no exceptions. These are the non-negotiables that separate a working system from a broken one.

But you've now got the map. Three zones. Clear boundaries. A framework that scales from your first feature to your hundredth.

Your AI isn't confused anymore. It knows where the lines are.
