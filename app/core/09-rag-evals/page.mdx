# RAG Foundations and Evaluation

Retrieval-augmented generation is the dominant architecture for connecting language models to organizational knowledge. It is also one of the most deceptively complex systems to build well. The gap between a RAG demo that impresses stakeholders and a RAG system that earns user trust in production is vast. This section closes that gap across nine chapters and 126 subchapters.

## What This Section Covers

**Chapter 1 — RAG Architecture Foundations** establishes the building blocks. You will learn what RAG actually means in 2026, when it is the right architecture versus fine-tuning or long context, and how to think about RAG failure modes, latency budgets, and cost before writing a single line of pipeline code.

**Chapter 2 — Indexing, Chunking, and Data Preparation** covers everything that happens before retrieval. Document ingestion, chunking strategies, metadata enrichment, deduplication, versioning, and the source trust controls that prevent your knowledge base from becoming a liability.

**Chapter 3 — Embeddings and Vector Search** dives deep into the retrieval engine. Embedding model selection, dense versus sparse representations, vector database operations, reranking, quantization, and the adversarial embedding attacks that sophisticated bad actors use to game similarity search.

**Chapter 4 — Query Understanding and Retrieval** focuses on what happens when a user asks a question. Query rewriting, multi-query strategies, HyDE, metadata filtering, hierarchical retrieval, permission-aware search, and adaptive retrieval depth that retrieves more chunks only when the query demands it.

**Chapter 5 — Context Assembly and Generation** covers the bridge between retrieval and response. Context window packing, relevance filtering, citation enforcement, faithfulness constraints, abstention, answerability detection, conflict resolution policies, and the special requirements of regulated industries where citation is compliance.

**Chapter 6 — RAG Evaluation Metrics and Methods** is the largest chapter with 17 subchapters covering every evaluation dimension. Retrieval metrics, faithfulness scoring, hallucination detection, citation accuracy, LLM-as-judge protocols, evaluation dataset construction, claim-level grounding, judge reliability, and the contamination traps that make RAG evals easy to fool.

**Chapter 7 — RAG Testing and Quality Assurance** translates evaluation into engineering practice. Unit testing components, integration testing pipelines, regression testing, adversarial testing, data freshness verification, multilingual testing, and corpus poisoning defense.

**Chapter 8 — Production RAG Operations** covers running RAG at scale. Observability, monitoring, cost management, scaling, caching, index maintenance, incident response, multi-tenant isolation, knowledge base governance, topic coverage monitoring, data residency routing, and latency SLAs with percentile guarantees.

**Chapter 9 — Advanced RAG Patterns and Future Directions** looks at what comes next. Agentic RAG, graph RAG, self-RAG, corrective RAG, code search, API retrieval, multimodal retrieval, personalization, enterprise knowledge management, and what changes as models get smarter.

## Who This Section Is For

This section is for engineers building RAG systems that must work reliably in production. If you are prototyping, start with Chapter 1 and Chapter 5. If you are debugging a production system, jump to Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. If you are designing evaluation, start with Chapter 6. Every chapter stands alone, but together they form the complete picture of RAG engineering in 2026.
