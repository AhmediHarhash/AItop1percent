# 6.14 — Answerability Metrics: False Answer vs Correct Abstention Tradeoffs

In July 2025, a Series B insurance technology company faced a crisis that perfectly illustrated the answerability problem. Their RAG system answered policy coverage questions for insurance agents, pulling from thousands of policy documents, rider specifications, and regulatory filings. Management had optimized aggressively for coverage: the system should answer as many questions as possible to maximize agent productivity.

Over six months, they reduced the system's abstention rate from thirty-five percent to twelve percent through prompt engineering and confidence threshold tuning. More questions received answers, support tickets for "system says it cannot answer" dropped dramatically, and agent satisfaction metrics improved in initial surveys.

Then a major client discovered that their agents had been selling policies with coverage misrepresentations based on RAG system answers. Fifteen policies required repricing and coverage corrections. The cost exceeded two hundred thousand dollars in premium adjustments, administrative overhead, and relationship damage. Investigation revealed the root cause: in the push to reduce abstentions, the system had started answering questions about edge cases where documents provided unclear or contradictory guidance.

Instead of abstaining and escalating to human experts, the system made confident statements based on partial information. Every answer was grounded in retrieved documents, so faithfulness metrics looked fine, but the system had lost the ability to recognize when it should not answer. The optimization for coverage had sacrificed safety. The CFO asked a question during the post-mortem that nobody could answer satisfactorily: "Why did we celebrate reducing abstentions when abstentions were protecting us from giving wrong answers?"

The fundamental challenge in RAG systems is that not all questions are answerable from available documents. Sometimes the information simply does not exist in your corpus. Sometimes documents provide partial information that is insufficient for a complete answer. Sometimes documents offer contradictory information without clear resolution.

A perfectly designed RAG system must know when it knows and when it does not know. It must answer confidently when documents support clear responses and abstain gracefully when they do not. This capability sits at the intersection of retrieval quality, generation capability, and epistemic humility. Measuring and optimizing it requires understanding two complementary error types: false answers where the system responds when it should abstain, and missed answers where the system abstains when it could respond. The tradeoff between these errors shapes system behavior and user trust.

## Defining False Answer Rate

False answer rate measures how often the system provides answers when it should recognize that the question is unanswerable from available documents. Computing this metric requires identifying unanswerable questions in your evaluation dataset. You include queries where the required information is not present in your corpus, where documents provide only partial information, or where documents present contradictory statements without resolution.

For each such query, you check whether the system correctly abstains or incorrectly provides an answer. If the system generates a response instead of abstaining, you count it as a false answer. The metric is the proportion of unanswerable questions that received answers. A false answer rate of twenty percent means one in five unanswerable questions gets answered instead of appropriately abstaining.

The challenge in measuring false answer rate is constructing unanswerable questions that realistically represent what users might ask. You cannot simply invent random questions that have nothing to do with your domain; users do not ask those questions, so they provide no signal about real system behavior.

Instead, you need questions that users might reasonably ask but that your documents do not answer. For a legal RAG system, this might include questions about recent legislation not yet in your corpus, questions about jurisdiction-specific rules when your corpus only covers federal law, or questions requiring comparison of statutes that your documents address separately without explicit comparison.

Creating these examples requires domain expertise and understanding of corpus limitations. You must know what information users expect to find but that your documents do not actually provide. Some teams generate unanswerable questions by identifying gaps in document coverage. Review your document corpus taxonomy and identify topics that are missing or underrepresented.

Generate questions about those topics. If your HR policy database lacks information about remote work equipment reimbursement, create questions asking about equipment policies. If your product documentation covers features A, B, and C but not feature D, create questions about feature D. This approach ensures unanswerable questions reflect actual gaps rather than artificial scenarios, though it requires maintaining a map of corpus coverage that itself requires ongoing maintenance.

## Missed Answer Rate and Coverage

Missed answer rate measures the opposite error: how often the system abstains when it actually could answer from available documents. Computing this metric requires answerable questions where you know the corpus contains sufficient information to construct good answers. For each such query, you check whether the system provides an answer or abstains.

If it abstains despite the question being answerable, you count it as a missed answer. The metric is the proportion of answerable questions that result in abstention. A missed answer rate of fifteen percent means fifteen out of every hundred answerable questions are incorrectly declined. This represents lost value: the system could have helped the user but chose not to.

The tradeoff between false answer rate and missed answer rate is fundamental and unavoidable. Making the system more conservative reduces false answers but increases missed answers. The system abstains more often, catching more cases where it should not answer but also declining some cases where it could answer.

Making the system more aggressive increases coverage, reducing missed answers but allowing more false answers through. Every RAG system sits somewhere on this tradeoff curve. You cannot simultaneously minimize both error types; you must choose where on the curve to operate based on the relative costs of each error type in your domain.

Visualizing this tradeoff as a curve similar to precision-recall curves helps build intuition. The x-axis represents false answer rate, the y-axis represents answer rate which is one minus missed answer rate. Points on the curve represent different system operating points, typically controlled by confidence thresholds.

At one extreme, the system answers everything, achieving one hundred percent answer rate but potentially high false answer rate. At the other extreme, the system abstains from everything, achieving zero false answer rate but also zero answer rate. Between these extremes, you find operating points that balance both concerns.

The curve shape depends on how well your system can distinguish answerable from unanswerable questions. Better discrimination produces curves closer to the top-left corner, maintaining high answer rates while keeping false answer rates low. Poor discrimination produces curves that force harsh tradeoffs: you can have high coverage or low false answers but not both.

## Threshold Optimization and Business Costs

Threshold optimization determines where on the tradeoff curve your system operates. Many RAG systems generate some confidence score or uncertainty estimate alongside answers. You might measure retrieval quality scores, use the generation model's log probabilities, or employ a separate classifier that predicts whether sufficient information exists to answer.

By setting a threshold on this score, you control system behavior: answer when confidence exceeds the threshold, abstain when it does not. Adjusting the threshold moves you along the tradeoff curve. Higher thresholds mean more abstentions, lower false answer rate, higher missed answer rate. Lower thresholds mean fewer abstentions, higher false answer rate, lower missed answer rate.

Finding the right threshold requires understanding the business impact of each error type. In medical triage systems, false answers can cause serious patient harm by providing incorrect medical guidance. The cost of a false answer might be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of a missed answer, which merely requires escalation to a human provider.

You set very high confidence thresholds, accepting that the system will miss many answerable questions in order to prevent false answers on unanswerable ones. In customer support systems for low-stakes queries, the cost balance might be reversed. A false answer might cause minor user inconvenience while a missed answer prevents automation benefits. You set lower thresholds, accepting some false answers to maximize coverage.

Quantifying these costs enables data-driven threshold optimization. Estimate the business cost of each error type in concrete terms. A false answer in a financial advice RAG system might lead to an investment decision resulting in an average loss of five thousand dollars across cases where it occurs. A missed answer might lead to a support escalation costing fifty dollars in agent time.

Given these costs, you can compute the expected cost of operating at different points on the tradeoff curve. If threshold T1 produces a five percent false answer rate and ten percent missed answer rate on your evaluation set of one thousand answerable and two hundred unanswerable questions, the expected cost is two hundred times point zero five times five thousand plus one thousand times point ten times fifty which equals fifty thousand plus five thousand equals fifty-five thousand dollars per thousand queries. Compare this against other thresholds to find the cost-minimizing operating point.

## Industry-Specific Tolerance Levels

Industry-specific tolerance levels reflect these cost structures. Medical, legal, and financial domains typically have very low tolerance for false answers due to potential harm and liability. These systems operate with high confidence thresholds, potentially abstaining on thirty to fifty percent of queries to ensure that provided answers are highly reliable.

Users in these domains understand and accept that systems will not answer everything. An insurance agent would rather escalate a complex coverage question to a human expert than receive a potentially incorrect answer from the RAG system. The cost of being wrong is too high to accept aggressive coverage targets.

Conversational AI, content recommendation, and productivity tools often have higher tolerance for false answers because the stakes are lower and users can recognize and recover from errors. These systems operate with lower confidence thresholds, potentially abstaining on only five to ten percent of queries to maximize utility while accepting that some answers will be flawed.

Users tolerate occasional wrong answers in exchange for broad coverage and rapid responses. A writing assistant that occasionally suggests a suboptimal word choice is annoying but not harmful. The value of high coverage outweighs the cost of occasional errors.

Regulatory environments influence tolerance levels beyond pure cost calculations. Healthcare systems operating under HIPAA, financial systems under SEC oversight, and legal systems subject to bar association rules face regulatory consequences for incorrect information provision.

Even if the direct business cost of a false answer is low, regulatory penalties, reputation damage, and legal liability make false answers extremely expensive. These systems must operate conservatively regardless of immediate user experience costs. Better to abstain and maintain regulatory compliance than answer and risk violations.

## Measuring Confidence Calibration

Calibration of confidence scores determines how well you can optimize thresholds. A well-calibrated system has confidence scores that reflect true accuracy probabilities: when the system claims eighty percent confidence, it is actually correct approximately eighty percent of the time. With good calibration, setting a confidence threshold of eighty percent produces predictable false answer rates.

Poor calibration means confidence scores do not reflect true probabilities, making threshold optimization unpredictable. You set a threshold that should reject unreliable answers but it either abstains too often or not often enough because the scores are miscalibrated. The system might claim ninety percent confidence on answers that are only seventy percent accurate, leading to excessive false answers even with apparently conservative thresholds.

Calibration can be measured and improved through standard techniques. Plot predicted confidence against actual correctness rates in bins. If predictions are well-calibrated, the calibration curve follows the diagonal: eighty percent confidence predictions are correct eighty percent of the time, ninety percent confidence predictions are correct ninety percent of the time.

Deviations indicate calibration problems: overconfidence shows predictions higher than actual accuracy, underconfidence shows predictions lower than actual accuracy. Recalibration techniques like isotonic regression or Platt scaling can improve calibration by learning a mapping from raw model outputs to calibrated probabilities.

Applying these techniques to your confidence scores before threshold optimization produces more predictable and controllable behavior. You can set thresholds based on desired error rates and actually achieve those rates in practice because your confidence scores accurately reflect underlying uncertainty.

## Partial Answers and Graceful Abstention

Graceful abstention improves user experience when the system cannot answer. Instead of simply saying "I cannot answer this question," the system can provide context about why it cannot answer and what the user might do instead. "I could not find information about remote work equipment policies in the available HR documentation. You might contact HR directly at extension 5555 or check the intranet for updated policies."

This approach reduces user frustration with abstentions while maintaining epistemic honesty. The system acknowledges its limitations rather than pretending to know something it does not. It also provides feedback for corpus improvement: if many users ask about topics the system cannot answer, those topics should be added to documentation.

Partial answers represent a middle ground between full answers and complete abstention. Instead of abstaining when information is incomplete, the system provides what it knows while clearly indicating what it does not know. "Based on available documents, the return window is thirty days for most products. I could not find specific information about electronics, which may have different policies. Confirm with customer service for electronics returns."

This approach reduces missed answer rate by providing value even when full answers are not possible, while managing false answer rate by explicitly communicating uncertainty and information gaps. Users receive useful partial information while understanding the answer's limitations.

The challenge is determining when partial answers are appropriate versus when complete abstention is safer. Partial medical advice might be more dangerous than no advice if users act on incomplete information without understanding the gaps. Partial financial information might lead to poor decisions if users do not realize key considerations are missing.

Domain expertise and user testing help establish when partial answers add value versus when they create risk. Start conservative, abstaining completely when information is incomplete, then gradually introduce partial answers in domains where testing shows they help rather than harm.

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistake teams make with answerability is not measuring it at all. They measure answer correctness, faithfulness, and relevance but never explicitly test whether the system appropriately abstains from unanswerable questions. The system learns to always answer because that is what maximizes measured metrics.

Only production failures reveal that the system lacks answerability judgment. By then, users have learned not to trust it or, worse, have been harmed by false answers. Building answerability metrics into evaluation from the beginning prevents this failure mode.

The second common mistake is setting thresholds based on gut feeling rather than data-driven cost analysis. Engineers pick a confidence threshold that "feels reasonable" without measuring the resulting error rates or understanding their business impact.

The system either abstains far too often, frustrating users and preventing adoption, or abstains far too rarely, causing quality and trust issues. Proper threshold optimization requires measurement, cost quantification, and explicit tradeoff acknowledgment. Spend time understanding the actual costs of false answers versus missed answers in your domain.

The third mistake is treating answerability as a binary decision when it exists on a spectrum. Questions are not simply answerable or unanswerable; they fall on a continuum from clearly answerable from comprehensive information, to answerable from partial information with caveats, to unanswerable due to information gaps.

Binary abstention decisions force you to draw arbitrary lines on this continuum. A more nuanced approach uses confidence scores and partial answers to communicate uncertainty levels rather than forcing yes-or-no decisions.

You build answerability measurement by including unanswerable questions in evaluation datasets, reflecting corpus gaps and ambiguities. You measure both false answer rate and missed answer rate, making the tradeoff explicit. You quantify the business impact of each error type in your domain. You implement confidence scoring and calibrate it to reflect true accuracy probabilities.

You optimize thresholds based on expected cost rather than intuition. You design graceful abstentions that guide users when the system cannot help. You monitor these metrics in production to detect drift as usage patterns and corpus coverage change. Knowing when to answer and when to abstain is not a nice-to-have capability. It is fundamental to user trust and system reliability. Measure it, optimize it, and maintain it throughout your system's lifecycle.
