# 1.2 — Dataset Engineering as a Discipline in 2026

**Dataset quality is no longer optional.** By 2026, the companies winning in AI are not the ones with the best models or the most compute. They are the ones who recognized that professional dataset engineering determines whether AI products succeed or fail in production. The organizational structures, career paths, and budgets have shifted accordingly. What was considered unskilled data entry work in 2023 is now a recognized engineering specialty commanding senior-level compensation and strategic influence. This transformation happened fast, and the gap between organizations that made the shift and those that did not is widening every quarter.

The difference is the maturation of dataset engineering as a discipline. This maturation happened fast. In 2023, dataset work was distributed across ML engineers, product managers, and outsourced labeling vendors.

There were no standardized tools, no shared best practices, and no clear career path. By 2026, dataset engineering is a recognized specialty with dedicated roles at most AI-forward companies, university courses teaching dataset design, conferences focused on dataset challenges, and a growing ecosystem of commercial and open-source tooling. The discipline has its own vocabulary, its own methods, and its own standards of rigor.

Teams that treat dataset work as an afterthought are falling behind. Teams that invest in dataset engineering talent and infrastructure are pulling ahead. The performance gap is measurable and growing.

## What Changed Between 2023 and 2026

In 2023, the dominant mental model was that datasets were a means to an end. You collected data to train a model. Once the model was trained, the dataset was discarded or archived.

The focus was on model architecture, training techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. Datasets were inputs. The real work was modeling.

This mental model came from the academic machine learning tradition, where datasets like ImageNet or GLUE were fixed benchmarks and the competition was about algorithmic innovation. Teams measured success by model performance on these static benchmarks, not by their ability to collect, curate, and evolve proprietary datasets. The innovation was in the model, not the data.

## Foundation Models Commoditized Algorithms

The shift began when foundation models commoditized algorithmic innovation. GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 4 were all within a few percentage points of each other on most benchmarks. The differentiator was no longer the model architecture.

The differentiator was the data: the evaluation data that guided product decisions, the fine-tuning data that specialized the model to your domain, the retrieval data that grounded outputs in your knowledge base, the production data that revealed edge cases and distribution drift. Companies that invested in data infrastructure started winning. Companies that relied on off-the-shelf models and generic prompts started losing.

The performance gap widened every quarter. The winners were the teams with proprietary datasets, not proprietary models. The competitive moat shifted from algorithms to data.

## Regulatory Pressure Accelerated Adoption

The second driver was the EU AI Act enforcement in 2025. The regulation required documentation of training data provenance, bias testing, and ongoing monitoring of model performance across demographic groups. Compliance was not optional.

Companies with rigorous dataset management already had the documentation. Companies without it faced six-figure consulting bills and months of retroactive data archaeology. The regulatory pressure accelerated the adoption of dataset versioning, metadata tracking, and bias assessment workflows.

Dataset engineering stopped being a nice-to-have and became a compliance requirement. Legal and compliance teams started asking questions about dataset lineage that ML teams could not answer without proper infrastructure. The questions were specific: where did this data come from, who labeled it, when was it collected, what biases does it contain, how was it validated.

Teams without answers faced legal risk. Teams with answers faced minimal friction. The regulatory environment rewarded infrastructure investment.

## Fine-Tuning Became Default Strategy

The third driver was the rise of fine-tuning as a default strategy. In 2023, fine-tuning was considered expensive and complex, reserved for specialized use cases. By 2025, fine-tuning APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source platforms made it accessible to any team with labeled data.

The bottleneck shifted from engineering effort to dataset quality. Teams discovered that fine-tuning on poorly curated data produced worse results than prompting. Fine-tuning on high-quality data produced step-function improvements.

The return on investment for dataset curation became obvious. Companies started hiring for dataset quality, not just dataset quantity. The job descriptions changed from "collect 100,000 examples" to "build stratified evaluation sets with validated labels."

The shift reflected a deeper understanding: fine-tuning amplifies data quality. Good data gets better. Bad data gets worse. The quality gate moved upstream to dataset curation.

## Tooling Maturation Enabled Scale

The fourth driver was tooling maturation. In 2023, dataset versioning meant saving CSV files with datestamped filenames. Labeling workflows meant spreadsheets and email threads. Bias detection meant manual audits.

By 2026, there were purpose-built platforms for dataset management: DVC for versioning, Label Studio and Snorkel for labeling workflows, Fiddler and Arthur for bias detection, Weights and Biases for experiment tracking tied to dataset versions. These tools made dataset engineering tractable at scale.

A single dataset engineer with the right tooling could manage workflows that previously required a team of five. The tooling investment paid for itself in reduced coordination overhead and improved dataset quality. The ecosystem matured from custom scripts to professional platforms.

The tools provided not just efficiency but also best practices. They enforced versioning discipline, standardized metadata tracking, and automated quality checks. Teams using these tools produced higher-quality datasets faster.

## The Rise of Dedicated Dataset Teams

The organizational structure of AI teams in 2026 reflects the new importance of datasets. At companies with mature AI products, dataset engineering is a peer function to ML engineering and product management. Dataset teams have dedicated headcount, budget, and roadmap ownership.

They are not support functions. They are product functions. Their output is versioned, tested, and deployed just like code.

They have OKRs tied to dataset quality metrics: coverage, label consistency, bias metrics, and version freshness. They participate in sprint planning, incident reviews, and product strategy discussions. They are first-class stakeholders.

The organizational chart reflects this status. Dataset teams report to the head of engineering or the head of product, not buried three levels deep in a data organization. They have hiring authority. They control their roadmap.

## Three Core Roles in Dataset Teams

A typical dataset team at a mid-sized AI company includes three roles. The first is the dataset engineer, who designs data collection pipelines, builds labeling workflows, versions datasets, and integrates dataset updates into training and evaluation pipelines. This role requires software engineering skills, familiarity with ML workflows, and deep knowledge of data quality assessment.

Dataset engineers write code. They build tools. They maintain infrastructure. They are not data analysts.

They are infrastructure engineers who specialize in data artifacts. They write Python, SQL, and bash scripts. They deploy workflows to Airflow or Prefect.

They manage cloud storage and database schemas. They debug pipeline failures and optimize performance. They build systems that scale to millions of examples.

## Data Curators Ensure Quality

The second role is the data curator, who focuses on labeling quality, guideline development, and domain expertise integration. Curators design annotation schemas, train labeling teams, audit labels for consistency, and resolve edge cases. This role requires domain knowledge, attention to detail, and the ability to translate ambiguous product requirements into concrete labeling guidelines.

Curators are the bridge between product intent and labeled data. They ensure that the dataset reflects what the product actually needs, not what the team assumed it needed. They write guidelines, conduct annotator training, review edge cases, and provide feedback to annotators.

They measure inter-annotator agreement and identify guideline ambiguities. They are part technical writer, part domain expert, part quality assurance. Their work determines whether the dataset is usable or garbage.

## Dataset Product Managers Align Strategy

The third role is the dataset product manager, who owns the dataset roadmap, prioritizes dataset improvements, and aligns dataset work with product goals. This role requires understanding of both ML capabilities and business constraints. Dataset PMs decide whether to invest in expanding evaluation coverage, improving labeling quality, or building new fine-tuning sets.

They make trade-offs between dataset breadth and depth. They translate product failures into dataset requirements. They ensure that dataset work is not isolated from the rest of the product development cycle.

They attend product reviews, prioritize labeling backlogs, and communicate dataset status to stakeholders. They manage budgets for labeling services and tooling. They advocate for dataset investments in quarterly planning.

They are the voice of dataset infrastructure in leadership meetings. They make the business case for data quality investments.

## Scaling the Team Structure

At smaller companies, these roles may be collapsed into one or two people, but the functions remain distinct. You cannot build high-quality datasets without engineering infrastructure, curation expertise, and product alignment. Teams that try to distribute dataset work across existing roles without dedicated ownership consistently produce low-quality datasets.

The work gets deprioritized. Guidelines are inconsistent. Versioning is ad hoc. Quality drifts.

Dedicated ownership matters. The first hire for a dataset team should be a dataset engineer who can build the infrastructure. The second hire should be a curator who can ensure quality. The third hire should be a PM who can align with product.

The sequence matters. Infrastructure comes first. Without pipelines and versioning, you cannot scale. Quality comes second. Without curation, the infrastructure produces garbage. Alignment comes third. Without product integration, the work does not drive impact.

## How Dataset Engineering Differs from Data Engineering and ML Engineering

Dataset engineering is often conflated with data engineering or ML engineering, but the disciplines are distinct. Data engineering focuses on building pipelines for transactional and analytical data: ETL workflows, data warehouses, streaming infrastructure, and analytics dashboards. Data engineers move data from source systems to storage systems to consumption systems.

They optimize for throughput, reliability, and cost. They do not typically engage with the semantic content of the data. A data engineer builds the pipeline that ingests user clickstream events.

They do not label which clicks represent purchase intent. They do not stratify events by user demographic. They do not version event schemas for reproducibility. Their concerns are operational, not semantic.

## ML Engineers Focus on Models

ML engineering focuses on training, deploying, and serving machine learning models. ML engineers build training pipelines, optimize inference latency, manage model versioning, and monitor production performance. They work with datasets, but they treat datasets as inputs to model training.

They do not typically own dataset creation, curation, or quality assessment. An ML engineer will fine-tune a model on a provided dataset. They will not design the labeling schema or audit the labels for consistency.

They assume the dataset is correct and focus on model optimization. If the dataset is flawed, the model will be flawed, but the ML engineer may not diagnose the root cause. Their expertise is in training dynamics, not data quality.

## Dataset Engineers Bridge Both Worlds

Dataset engineering sits between these disciplines. Dataset engineers build pipelines like data engineers, but the pipelines produce labeled, versioned, semantically rich datasets, not raw transactional data. Dataset engineers collaborate with ML engineers, but they own the dataset as a product, not just as an input.

They are responsible for ensuring that the dataset is representative, unbiased, well-documented, and version-controlled. They design labeling workflows, manage annotator quality, detect and fix labeling errors, and evolve datasets as product requirements change. They understand both the statistical properties of the data and the product requirements it must satisfy.

The skill set is hybrid. Dataset engineers need software engineering skills to build scalable pipelines and versioning systems. They need ML knowledge to understand how datasets affect model behavior.

They need domain expertise to design meaningful labeling schemas. They need product sense to prioritize dataset improvements. They need project management skills to coordinate labeling teams and stakeholders.

This breadth is why dataset engineering has emerged as a separate discipline. No existing role covered the full scope. Data engineers lack ML context. ML engineers lack data curation expertise. Product managers lack technical depth. Dataset engineers combine all three.

## The Skills Required for Dataset Engineering in 2026

The core technical skill is data pipeline engineering. Dataset engineers build systems that ingest raw data, apply transformations, route data to labeling workflows, aggregate labels, validate quality, and export versioned datasets. These pipelines must handle scale, concurrency, and failure gracefully.

They must integrate with labeling platforms, version control systems, and ML training workflows. Building these pipelines requires proficiency in Python, familiarity with workflow orchestration tools like Airflow or Prefect, and experience with data storage systems like PostgreSQL, S3, or DuckDB. Dataset engineers must understand data serialization formats like Parquet, JSONL, and Arrow.

They must know how to parallelize data processing and handle failures. They must design for idempotency and reproducibility. Every pipeline run must produce the same output given the same input.

## Labeling Workflow Design Requires User Experience Thinking

The second skill is labeling workflow design. Dataset engineers must translate ambiguous task definitions into concrete annotation guidelines. They must design labeling interfaces that minimize annotator error.

They must build quality control mechanisms like inter-annotator agreement checks, gold standard validation, and anomaly detection. They must manage annotator training and feedback loops. This requires user experience design, technical writing, and statistical reasoning.

A poorly designed labeling workflow produces garbage data no matter how much money you spend on annotators. A well-designed workflow produces high-quality labels at scale with minimal rework. The design determines the outcome.

## Bias Detection is Non-Negotiable

The third skill is bias detection and mitigation. Dataset engineers must identify and measure bias in datasets across demographic groups, edge case categories, and input distributions. They must design stratified sampling strategies to ensure balanced representation.

They must audit models for disparate performance across slices. They must document bias and communicate risk to stakeholders. This requires knowledge of fairness metrics, statistical testing, and regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act guidelines on bias assessment.

Dataset engineers must understand concepts like demographic parity, equalized odds, and calibration. They must know how to measure and visualize performance across slices. They must communicate statistical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

Bias work is not optional. It is a regulatory requirement and a product quality requirement. Datasets with undetected bias create legal risk and user harm.

## Version Control for Data is Infrastructure

The fourth skill is version control and reproducibility. Dataset engineers must version datasets alongside code and models. They must ensure that every model training run is tied to a specific dataset version.

They must enable rollback when a dataset change causes performance regression. They must document dataset lineage so teams can trace production failures back to specific data collection decisions. This requires familiarity with tools like DVC, Git LFS, or custom versioning systems, and a deep understanding of reproducibility best practices.

Dataset engineers must treat datasets like code: every change is tracked, documented, and reviewable. Every version is immutable and reproducible. The discipline is the same. The artifacts are different.

## Evaluation Framework Design Aligns Metrics with Product Goals

The fifth skill is evaluation framework design. Dataset engineers build evaluation datasets that measure what matters. They design test sets stratified by difficulty, edge case type, and business impact.

They define metrics that align with product goals. They build automated evaluation pipelines that run on every model update. They surface performance regressions and slice-specific failures.

This requires both ML knowledge and product sense. The best evaluation frameworks are not generic. They are tailored to the specific failure modes that hurt your users. They prioritize the cases that drive complaints, escalations, and churn.

Generic benchmarks measure generic capabilities. Product-specific evaluation sets measure product quality. The difference is alignment with user needs.

## Communication Skills are Essential

The sixth skill is communication and documentation. Dataset engineers must document datasets with the same rigor as code. They write dataset cards explaining purpose, composition, collection process, and known limitations.

They communicate dataset changes to stakeholders. They present bias metrics to legal and compliance teams. They train ML engineers on how to use datasets correctly.

They translate technical details into language that product managers and executives understand. Strong written and verbal communication skills are not optional. They are essential. Dataset work is collaborative. Engineers who cannot explain their work cannot drive adoption.

## Tooling Landscape in 2026

The tooling ecosystem for dataset engineering has matured significantly since 2023. The first category is labeling platforms. Label Studio, Prodigy, and Scale AI offer interfaces for annotation, quality control, and annotator management.

These platforms support multiple annotation types: classification, named entity recognition, bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, and free-text generation. They integrate with annotation services and in-house labeling teams. They track annotator agreement and provide audit trails.

Teams no longer build custom labeling UIs unless they have highly specialized requirements. The cost of building and maintaining a custom labeling platform exceeds the cost of commercial or open-source alternatives. The platforms are mature, feature-rich, and well-supported.

## Versioning Tools Enable Reproducibility

The second category is dataset versioning. DVC and Git LFS enable versioning of large datasets alongside code. They track dataset lineage, enable reproducible training runs, and support collaboration across teams.

Weights and Biases and MLflow integrate dataset versioning with experiment tracking, so every training run is linked to a specific dataset version. This integration is critical for debugging regressions and understanding model performance trends over time. Without it, teams lose the ability to reproduce experiments and trace failures to root causes.

The tooling cost is negligible compared to the cost of debugging without version control. The return on investment is immediate. The first time you need to reproduce an experiment or debug a regression, the tooling pays for itself.

## Bias Detection Tools Meet Compliance Needs

The third category is bias detection and monitoring. Fiddler, Arthur, and TruEra provide tools for measuring model performance across demographic slices, detecting drift, and surfacing fairness issues. These platforms integrate with production inference pipelines and surface alerts when performance degrades on specific subpopulations.

They support regulatory compliance by generating bias reports and documentation required by the EU AI Act and similar regulations. They provide dashboards that visualize performance disparities and track fairness metrics over time. Legal and compliance teams use these dashboards to assess risk and ensure regulatory compliance.

The platforms translate statistical metrics into business-friendly visualizations. They make bias measurable and actionable. They reduce the time from detection to mitigation.

## Synthetic Data Augments Real Data

The fourth category is synthetic data generation. Platforms like Gretel and Mostly AI generate synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties of real data while protecting privacy. Synthetic data is increasingly used for augmentation, especially in domains like healthcare and finance where real data is scarce or restricted.

The quality of synthetic data has improved substantially since 2023, though it is still not a full replacement for real labeled data in most cases. Synthetic data works best when blended with real data to increase coverage of edge cases without introducing distribution mismatch. The use case is augmentation, not replacement.

## Data Quality Tools Prevent Corruption

The fifth category is data quality assessment. Great Expectations and Pandera provide frameworks for defining and enforcing data quality rules. These tools validate that datasets meet schema requirements, statistical properties, and domain constraints.

They catch data quality issues before datasets are used in training or evaluation. They are the analog of unit tests for datasets. Dataset engineers write assertions that check for missing values, outliers, format violations, and statistical anomalies.

These assertions run automatically on every dataset version and fail fast when quality issues are detected. The discipline is the same as code testing. The artifacts are datasets instead of code.

## Organizational Placement of Dataset Teams

The organizational placement of dataset teams varies by company stage and product focus. At large enterprises with multiple AI products, dataset engineering often reports to a centralized AI platform or ML infrastructure team. The dataset team provides shared services: labeling workflows, versioning infrastructure, and evaluation frameworks that multiple product teams use.

This model achieves economies of scale and consistency, but it can create friction if the centralized team does not understand the specific needs of individual products. Centralized teams risk becoming bottlenecks if they are under-resourced or misaligned with product priorities. The tradeoff is standardization versus responsiveness.

## Embedded Teams Ensure Product Alignment

At mid-sized companies with a single flagship AI product, dataset teams are often embedded in the product organization. They sit alongside ML engineers and product managers and participate in sprint planning and roadmap discussions. This model ensures tight alignment between dataset work and product needs, but it can lead to duplicated effort if the company later launches additional AI products.

Embedded teams have deep context on product requirements but may reinvent solutions that a centralized team would standardize. The right choice depends on the company's growth trajectory and product strategy. Early-stage companies benefit from embedding. Scaling companies benefit from centralization.

## Startups Must Prioritize Dataset Expertise Early

At startups, dataset engineering is often a part-time responsibility of the founding ML engineer or a contract role. This is pragmatic given resource constraints, but it is risky. Dataset quality problems compound over time.

Early shortcuts create technical debt that becomes expensive to fix later. Startups that plan to scale their AI products should hire dataset expertise early, even if it is a single dedicated person. The cost of hiring a dataset engineer is lower than the cost of rebuilding datasets from scratch when quality problems emerge.

The first dataset hire should focus on building infrastructure that scales. They should establish versioning practices, labeling workflows, and evaluation frameworks. They should prevent technical debt, not fix it retroactively.

## Ownership Prevents Decay

Regardless of org structure, the critical factor is ownership. Datasets must have named owners who are accountable for quality, versioning, and maintenance. Shared ownership leads to neglect.

If everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. The dataset decays. Labels become inconsistent. Versioning breaks down.

Bias goes undetected. The product suffers. Clear ownership prevents this decay.

The owner is accountable for metrics, documentation, and stakeholder communication. The owner has authority to make decisions about dataset changes. The owner has budget to invest in improvements. The accountability is explicit and measurable.

## The Career Path for Dataset Engineers

In 2023, there was no career path for dataset work. People who enjoyed data curation and labeling workflow design often left the field because there was no progression beyond junior analyst roles. By 2026, there is a clear career ladder.

Junior dataset engineers focus on execution: building pipelines, running labeling workflows, versioning datasets. They implement designs created by senior engineers. They follow established processes.

They learn the tools and methods. They build proficiency in data pipelines, labeling platforms, and version control. They execute under supervision.

## Mid-Level Engineers Own Full Datasets

Mid-level dataset engineers own entire datasets end-to-end: they design labeling schemas, build quality controls, and integrate datasets into training and evaluation workflows. They make architectural decisions. They mentor junior engineers.

They collaborate with ML engineers and product managers to prioritize dataset improvements. They have deep expertise in one or two domains. They are trusted to design and execute complex dataset projects independently.

They identify problems and propose solutions without direction. They drive projects from conception to completion. They unblock themselves.

## Senior Engineers Set Strategy

Senior dataset engineers define dataset strategy, build tooling and infrastructure used across teams, and mentor junior engineers. They set standards for dataset quality, versioning, and documentation. They influence product roadmaps by identifying dataset-related risks and opportunities.

They represent the dataset team in cross-functional discussions. They have broad expertise across multiple domains and products. They lead large projects that span quarters.

They make trade-offs between competing priorities. They balance immediate needs with long-term infrastructure investments. They think in quarters and years, not sprints.

## Staff and Principal Roles Emerge

Staff and principal dataset engineers are emerging as individual contributor leadership roles. They set dataset standards across the company, drive adoption of new tools and methods, and represent dataset engineering in cross-functional technical discussions. They are peer to staff ML engineers and staff data engineers.

They have influence over product decisions, infrastructure investments, and hiring priorities. They publish papers, give conference talks, and contribute to open-source tools. They shape the industry, not just their company.

They are recognized externally as thought leaders. Their influence extends beyond their organization. They define best practices that other companies adopt.

## Compensation Reflects Strategic Value

The demand for dataset engineering talent in 2026 exceeds supply. Companies are hiring aggressively and offering competitive compensation. A mid-level dataset engineer at a well-funded AI company earns between $150,000 and $200,000 in total compensation.

Senior dataset engineers earn $200,000 to $280,000. Staff-level roles exceed $300,000. These numbers reflect the recognition that dataset quality is a product differentiator and that expertise in this domain is rare.

Companies compete for talent by offering high compensation, interesting problems, and career growth opportunities. The scarcity drives the market. The strategic value justifies the cost.

## Education and Training for Dataset Engineering

Universities are beginning to offer courses in dataset design and curation. Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon have added dataset engineering modules to their ML curricula. These courses cover labeling workflow design, bias detection, versioning, and evaluation framework development.

They use real-world case studies and hands-on projects. Graduates are entering the job market with formal training in dataset practices, which was unheard of in 2023. The courses teach both theory and practice: students learn fairness metrics and also build labeling workflows.

They study dataset versioning and also implement pipelines. The curriculum is practical, not purely theoretical. Graduates can contribute on day one.

## Online Courses Serve Working Professionals

Online education platforms like Coursera and Deeplearning AI have launched dataset engineering courses aimed at working professionals. These courses teach practical skills: how to use DVC for versioning, how to build labeling workflows in Label Studio, how to measure and mitigate bias, how to design evaluation sets. They include capstone projects where students build and version a dataset for a real task.

Completion rates are high because the skills are immediately applicable. Students apply what they learn at work the same week they learn it. The courses create a pipeline of talent with baseline competency.

The accessibility democratizes expertise. Engineers from non-traditional backgrounds can upskill without returning to school. The barrier to entry drops.

## Internal Training Scales Knowledge

Internal training programs at AI-forward companies are also common. Companies invest in training ML engineers, data engineers, and product managers on dataset best practices. They run workshops on labeling guideline design, bias detection, and evaluation metrics.

They build internal tooling and documentation to standardize dataset workflows. This investment pays off in dataset quality, reduced rework, and faster iteration cycles. Internal training ensures that the entire organization understands dataset engineering and can collaborate effectively with dataset teams.

The knowledge becomes organizational, not siloed in one team. Cross-functional collaboration improves. Miscommunication decreases.

## Why 2026 Is the Inflection Point

The maturation of dataset engineering as a discipline in 2026 is not accidental. It reflects the convergence of regulatory pressure, tooling availability, and competitive necessity. The EU AI Act forced companies to take dataset documentation and bias assessment seriously.

Improved tooling made dataset engineering tractable at scale. The commoditization of foundation models shifted competitive advantage to data. Companies that recognized this shift early built dataset teams and infrastructure.

Companies that ignored it are now scrambling to catch up. The gap between leaders and laggards widens every month. The leaders have datasets covering millions of examples. The laggards have spreadsheets.

The leaders ship weekly model improvements. The laggards debug the same issues repeatedly. The competitive gap is structural. It compounds.

## Datasets Are Defensible Advantages

The teams that will dominate AI product categories in the next three years are the teams with the best datasets, not the best models. Models are increasingly interchangeable. Datasets are unique.

They reflect your domain, your users, your edge cases, and your product priorities. They are defensible competitive advantages. Building them requires dedicated expertise, rigorous processes, and sustained investment.

Dataset engineering is no longer optional. It is table stakes. Companies without dataset infrastructure are at existential risk.

Their products will lag. Their compliance costs will escalate. Their talent will leave for companies that treat datasets seriously. The market is sorting winners from losers based on data quality.

In the next section, we will examine the dataset lifecycle from collection to retirement, and the failures that occur when teams treat datasets as static artifacts.
