# 10.7 — Internal Dataset Marketplaces: Discovery and Reuse

The duplicate dataset anti-pattern shows up everywhere. A team spends six weeks building a training dataset for medical question classification, only to discover later that another team built nearly the same thing four months earlier. The waste is obvious: two teams, two engineering sprints, two sets of annotation costs, two maintenance burdens. But the root cause is not lack of communication. It is lack of infrastructure. If you cannot find what already exists, you will build it again.

The discovery problem is structural. Most organizations have more datasets than they know about. Datasets get created for one-off experiments, saved to shared drives, stored in S3 buckets with cryptic names, documented nowhere. When a new team needs data, they search Slack, ask around, check a few shared folders, find nothing useful, and start building from scratch. Meanwhile, the dataset they need sits three folders deep in a namespace they never thought to check. Discovery is a search problem, not a documentation problem. If the metadata is not indexed and the search interface does not exist, no amount of documentation will help.

## The Economic Case for Dataset Reuse

Building a dataset once and using it many times is the only sustainable model at scale. The upfront cost of creating a high-quality dataset is substantial: sourcing, cleaning, annotation, validation, versioning, documentation. If that cost is amortized across one project, the cost per use is high. If amortized across ten projects, the cost per use drops by an order of magnitude. Reuse is not just efficient, it is financially necessary.

The math is straightforward. A team spends eighty thousand dollars and six weeks building a customer support conversation dataset with ten thousand annotated examples. If only one model uses that dataset, the cost per model is eighty thousand dollars. If five models use it, the cost per model is sixteen thousand dollars. If twenty models use it, the cost per model is four thousand dollars. The dataset quality is the same in all cases, but the economic efficiency changes dramatically. Reuse turns dataset engineering from a cost center into a shared asset.

The reuse multiplier compounds over time. A dataset built in early 2025 and used by three teams in 2025 might be used by eight teams in 2026 as more projects come online. The original investment is paid back many times over. But reuse only happens if discovery is easy. If teams cannot find the dataset, they will not use it. If they cannot evaluate its quality without downloading and inspecting it manually, they will assume it is not good enough and build their own. The friction of discovery determines the rate of reuse.

## What Makes a Dataset Discoverable

Discoverability is a function of metadata, search, and preview. Metadata tells you what the dataset contains: name, description, schema, size, creation date, owner, license, known issues. Search lets you find datasets that match your criteria: topic, domain, format, language, quality tier. Preview lets you inspect a sample before committing to use it: the first hundred rows, example documents, annotation distributions. Without all three, discovery fails.

Metadata must be structured and consistent. A dataset named "customer-conversations-v3-final-FINAL-jan2025" with no description is not discoverable. A dataset named "support-chat-dataset" with a description that says "customer support conversations from 2024 to 2025, English, annotated for intent and sentiment, 10,247 examples, 94% inter-annotator agreement, GDPR-compliant" is discoverable. The difference is not the data itself, it is the metadata wrapper around it. Metadata is the product packaging for datasets.

Search requires indexing. If datasets are stored as files in S3 with no central catalog, search is impossible. If datasets are registered in a data catalog with tags, owners, and full-text search on descriptions, search is trivial. Tags are critical: "customer-support," "intent-classification," "English," "high-quality," "GDPR," "production-ready." A team searching for customer support data should see every dataset tagged "customer-support" in the results. Tags are the taxonomy that makes search work.

Preview is the final filter. Metadata and search get you to a candidate list, but preview tells you whether the dataset actually fits your use case. Preview means showing sample rows, schema definitions, annotation examples, quality metrics, and known issues without requiring a full download. A team evaluating three candidate datasets should be able to inspect samples from all three in under ten minutes. If preview requires downloading gigabytes of data, unpacking compressed files, and writing custom parsing code, reuse will not happen. Friction kills reuse.

## The Internal Dataset Marketplace Model

An internal dataset marketplace is a catalog where teams publish datasets and other teams discover and consume them. The marketplace is not a literal marketplace with pricing, though some organizations do implement internal cost recovery models. The marketplace is a centralized registry with search, metadata, access controls, and usage tracking. It is the internal equivalent of Hugging Face Datasets or Kaggle, but private and curated for your organization.

The marketplace model solves the discovery problem by making dataset publication a formal step. When a team finishes building a dataset, they register it in the marketplace: upload metadata, tag it, write a description, specify access controls, upload a preview sample. The dataset is now discoverable by every other team. The act of publication creates the index that makes search possible. Without publication, datasets remain invisible.

Publication also creates accountability. A published dataset has an owner, a documented schema, a version history, and a quality statement. The owner is responsible for maintaining it, responding to issues, and communicating breaking changes. A dataset that is not published has none of these things. Publication is the difference between a shared folder and a managed asset. Managed assets get reused. Shared folders get ignored.

The marketplace shows usage statistics. How many teams are using this dataset? How many models? How many downloads this month? Usage is a quality signal. A dataset used by twelve teams is more likely to be well-maintained and fit for purpose than a dataset used by zero teams. High usage does not guarantee quality, but it increases confidence. A team evaluating two datasets with similar descriptions will choose the one with higher usage because social proof matters.

## Quality Signals for Dataset Reuse

Reuse depends on trust, and trust depends on quality signals. A team will not reuse a dataset unless they believe it meets their quality bar. Quality signals are the evidence that builds that belief: ratings, reviews, known issues, test results, validation reports, lineage, ownership.

Ratings and reviews work the same way they work for products. A dataset with an average rating of four point seven stars from twenty-three reviewers is more trustworthy than a dataset with no ratings. Reviews provide qualitative feedback: "Great for intent classification, but labels are inconsistent for edge cases." "High quality but only covers U.S. English." "Used in production for six months with no issues." Reviews surface the context that metadata alone cannot convey.

Known issues must be surfaced prominently. A dataset with a known issue section that says "Contains 3% duplicate records due to ingestion bug in version 2.1, fixed in 2.2" is more trustworthy than a dataset with no known issues section, because the former is honest. Teams expect issues. What they cannot tolerate is hidden issues that break their models after two weeks of integration work. Transparency builds trust. Hiding issues destroys it.

Validation reports are formal quality evidence. A dataset that includes a validation report showing inter-annotator agreement, schema compliance, null rates, outlier analysis, and demographic coverage is far more reusable than a dataset with no validation. Validation reports answer the questions teams ask before reuse: Is this data clean? Is it representative? Is it biased? Can I trust the labels? A one-page validation summary is worth ten pages of prose description.

Lineage shows where the data came from and how it was transformed. A dataset with documented lineage that says "Sourced from production logs 2024-09 to 2025-01, filtered for U.S. region, PII removed via named entity recognition, annotated by vendor X, validated by internal team Y" is reusable because the provenance is clear. A dataset with no lineage is a black box. Black boxes do not get reused in regulated industries or high-stakes applications.

Ownership information must be visible and current. Every dataset needs an owner: a person or team responsible for maintenance, quality, and breaking changes. The owner is the point of contact when something goes wrong. A dataset with an owner who responds to issues within one business day is reusable. A dataset with an owner who left the company six months ago is not. Ownership is not metadata, it is accountability.

## The Governance Layer for Dataset Reuse

Not all datasets can be reused by all teams. Access control is part of governance. A dataset containing personally identifiable information can only be accessed by teams with a legitimate business need and appropriate data handling training. A dataset built for a specific regulated product cannot be repurposed for an unregulated product without legal review. Reuse is gated by policy, not just by technical access.

The governance layer defines who can access what under what conditions. Access tiers are common: public internal datasets accessible to all teams, restricted datasets accessible only to approved teams, confidential datasets accessible only to specific individuals. The marketplace enforces these tiers through role-based access controls. A team searching for datasets sees only the datasets they are authorized to access. Unauthorized datasets are not hidden from search results, they are marked as requiring access approval.

Access request workflows formalize the approval process. A team that wants to use a restricted dataset submits an access request: project description, intended use, data handling plan, retention policy. The dataset owner reviews the request and approves or denies it. Approval grants access for a defined period, typically six months or one year. When the period expires, access is revoked unless renewed. This model ensures that access is tied to active use, not permanent entitlement.

Purpose limitation is critical for privacy and compliance. A dataset collected for product analytics cannot be used for marketing without review. A dataset collected for fraud detection cannot be used for credit scoring without legal approval. The marketplace tracks intended use when the dataset is published and restricts reuse to compatible purposes. Teams requesting access for a different purpose must justify the change and obtain additional approvals. Purpose limitation prevents scope creep and compliance violations.

Breaking changes require notification. If a dataset schema changes in a way that breaks downstream consumers, the owner must notify all teams using the dataset at least two weeks before the change goes live. Notification includes migration guidance: what changed, how to adapt, when the old version will be deprecated. Teams have the option to stay on the old version temporarily or migrate immediately. Breaking changes without notification destroy trust and stop reuse.

## Technical Implementation: Data Catalogs and Search

Building an internal dataset marketplace requires a data catalog tool. Open-source options include Amundsen, DataHub, and OpenMetadata. Commercial options include Alation, Collibra, and Atlan. The choice depends on scale, integration needs, and budget. Small organizations can start with a simple internal wiki or Notion database. Large organizations need a dedicated catalog with API integrations, access controls, and usage analytics.

The catalog stores metadata for every dataset: name, description, owner, creation date, schema, size, location, tags, access tier, known issues, validation reports, lineage. The catalog also stores usage metadata: which teams are using the dataset, which models, how many queries, last access date. Metadata is updated automatically through integrations with data storage systems and manually through owner submissions.

Search is the primary interface. Teams search by keyword, tag, domain, or schema. Search results show dataset name, description, owner, quality rating, and usage count. Clicking into a dataset shows full metadata, preview samples, validation reports, known issues, and access instructions. The search interface is the front door to the marketplace. If search is slow or returns irrelevant results, teams will not use it.

Preview samples are embedded in the catalog. The catalog shows the first hundred rows, the schema definition, annotation distributions, and example documents without requiring a download. Preview samples are pre-generated when the dataset is published and stored separately from the full dataset. This allows instant preview without transferring large files. Preview is the quality gate that determines whether a team moves forward with integration or keeps searching.

Access request workflows are built into the catalog. If a dataset is restricted, the catalog shows an "Request Access" button. Clicking it opens a form: team name, project description, intended use, expected duration. The form is submitted to the dataset owner, who receives a notification and reviews it in the catalog interface. Approval grants access immediately through integration with the underlying storage system. Denial includes a reason and optional guidance on how to get approval.

## Making Reuse the Path of Least Resistance

Reuse happens when it is easier than building from scratch. If discovering a dataset takes five minutes, evaluating it takes ten minutes, and getting access takes one day, reuse is easy. If discovering a dataset takes three days of asking around, evaluating it requires downloading and parsing gigabytes of data, and getting access requires a two-week legal review, reuse will not happen. Friction is the enemy of reuse.

The default must be reuse, not build. When a team proposes building a new dataset, the first question should be "Did you search the marketplace?" If the answer is no, the proposal is rejected until a search is completed. If the answer is yes but nothing relevant was found, the search query and results should be documented. This forces discovery to be a prerequisite for new dataset work. Over time, teams internalize the habit: search first, build only if nothing exists.

The marketplace must be kept current. A marketplace with fifty datasets, all of which are actively maintained and up to date, is more useful than a marketplace with five hundred datasets, most of which are stale or abandoned. Stale datasets create noise and reduce trust. The catalog should surface freshness signals: last updated date, active maintainer status, recent usage. Datasets that have not been used in twelve months should be marked as deprecated or archived unless the owner explicitly confirms ongoing maintenance.

Incentives matter. If teams are rewarded for building datasets but not for maintaining or publishing them, reuse will not scale. Recognize teams that publish high-reuse datasets. Track reuse metrics as part of dataset team performance. Celebrate teams that avoided duplicate work by finding and reusing an existing dataset. The organizational culture determines whether reuse becomes standard practice or remains an aspiration.

Discovery and reuse are the foundation of dataset efficiency at scale. Without them, every team builds in isolation, costs multiply, and quality fragments. With them, datasets become shared infrastructure, costs amortize across many uses, and quality improves through collective feedback. But discovery requires infrastructure, and infrastructure requires investment. Once that investment is made, the path to reuse becomes clear, and the question shifts from whether teams share datasets to how sharing agreements are structured.
