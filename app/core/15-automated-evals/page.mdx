# Automated Eval Pipelines

Your AI system produces ten thousand outputs per hour. You cannot have humans review every one. But you also cannot ship without knowing whether quality is holding. Automated evaluation is how you bridge that gap — programmatic systems that measure quality continuously, catch regressions before users do, and give you the confidence to deploy at scale. Done right, automated evals become your always-on quality immune system. Done wrong, they become a source of false confidence that lets broken systems reach production while your dashboards show green.

This section covers the full landscape of automated evaluation for 2026: from deterministic rule checks to LLM-as-judge systems, from heuristic signals to behavioral evals for agents. You will learn the cheap-to-expensive tiering pattern that lets you evaluate millions of outputs economically. You will learn how to calibrate automated evals against human judgment, detect when evals drift, and build pipelines that integrate with CI/CD workflows. You will learn how to evaluate safety and risk as first-class concerns, not afterthoughts. And you will learn the failure modes that cause automated evals to lie — silently, confidently, catastrophically.

*The eval system that catches the regression before your users do is worth more than the team that scrambles to fix it afterward. Automated evaluation is not optional infrastructure — it is the foundation that makes continuous deployment possible.*
