# Chapter 2 — Rule-Based and Deterministic Evals

Rule-based evaluation is the foundation of every automated eval system. These are the checks that never hallucinate, never drift, and never need calibration against human judgment — because they are deterministic. If your output must be valid JSON, a schema validator tells you instantly whether it is. If your response must include a citation, a presence check confirms it. Rule-based evals are fast, cheap, and completely reliable within their scope. Their limitation is that scope: they catch structural failures but miss semantic ones. This chapter covers how to design rule-based evals that catch the failures they can catch, how to combine them into composite checks, and how to recognize when you have reached the edge of what rules can do.

*The rule that catches a malformed tool call before it reaches the user costs nothing and prevents everything. Start here.*
