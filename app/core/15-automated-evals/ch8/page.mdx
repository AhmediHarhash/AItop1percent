# Chapter 8 — Eval Pipeline Architecture

Evals are only useful if they run. A perfect eval that takes too long, costs too much, or requires manual triggering does not protect your production system. Eval pipeline architecture is the infrastructure that makes automated evaluation operational: when evals trigger, how they scale, how results are stored and queried, and how the pipeline integrates with your deployment workflow. This chapter covers CI/CD integration patterns, compute strategies from batch to streaming, parallelization and caching for throughput, dataset versioning for reproducibility, multi-stage pipelines that run cheap evals first and expensive evals only when needed, and the monitoring that tells you when your eval pipeline itself is broken.

*The eval that runs in your CI pipeline blocks bad deploys. The eval that runs in a notebook blocks nothing.*
