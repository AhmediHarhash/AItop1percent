# 1.2 — Proprietary Frontier Models: GPT-5 and GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, and Grok 4

In September 2025, a healthcare analytics company rebuilt their clinical note summarization system from GPT-4o to GPT-5. The migration took four days. The system worked. The summaries were more coherent. The extraction of patient histories was more accurate. The cost was manageable: $14,200 per month for 18,000 notes. The product manager was satisfied. Then in January 2026, an engineer ran the same workload on Claude Opus 4.5. The summaries were equally coherent. The extraction accuracy was two percentage points higher. The cost was $9,800 per month. The team had assumed that the newest model from the market leader would be the best choice. They had not tested the assumption. They had picked GPT-5 because it was the newest release from OpenAI and everyone was writing about it. They never compared it to Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro on their actual task. That assumption cost them $4,400 per month. The lesson was not that GPT-5 is bad. The lesson was that newest does not mean best for your task. You need to know what each frontier model is actually good at, not just what the benchmarks say.

This is the state of proprietary frontier models as of January 2026. There are five major providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and a tier of specialized providers. Each provider has multiple models at different performance and cost tiers. Each model has different strengths. GPT-5 and GPT-5.2 lead on reasoning and structured data extraction. Claude Opus 4.5 leads on coding and long-document understanding. Gemini 3 leads on multimodal tasks and visual reasoning. Grok 4 integrates with X platform data and excels at real-time information synthesis. The performance gaps are not uniform. A model that dominates one benchmark might lag on another. A model that is best for one task type might be mediocre for another. You cannot pick a model by reading launch announcements. You need to understand what each model is optimized for, what each model costs, and how each model behaves on production workloads. That is what this subchapter covers.

## OpenAI: GPT-5, GPT-5.2, and the Mini and Nano Variants

OpenAI released GPT-5 in August 2025. The launch was positioned as a reasoning breakthrough. The model introduced a unified architecture that handled text, code, and structured data with a single transformer backbone. The context window was 256,000 tokens. The training data included proprietary datasets on mathematics, scientific reasoning, and formal logic. The benchmark performance was strong: GPT-5 matched or exceeded GPT-4o on every major benchmark and set new records on MMLU-Pro, GPQA Diamond, and MATH-500. The pricing was $18 per million input tokens and $54 per million output tokens. That was roughly double the cost of GPT-4o. The value proposition was clear: if you need the absolute best reasoning performance and cost is not the primary constraint, use GPT-5.

Then in December 2025, OpenAI released GPT-5.2. This was not a minor update. GPT-5.2 crossed the 90% threshold on ARC-AGI, the benchmark designed to test abstract reasoning and generalization. No model had done that before. The improvement was not just on reasoning. GPT-5.2 also improved on code generation, achieving 89% on HumanEval and 78% on MBPP compared to GPT-5's 85% and 74%. The context window expanded to 512,000 tokens. The pricing increased to $22 per million input tokens and $66 per million output tokens. That made GPT-5.2 the most expensive frontier model on the market. The positioning was explicit: this is the model you use when you need the highest capability and you are willing to pay for it. For most production systems, the cost is prohibitive. A system processing 10,000 requests per day with an average of 2,000 input tokens and 500 output tokens would cost approximately $77,000 per month on GPT-5.2. That is sustainable only if the value delivered per request is very high or if the volume is low.

OpenAI also released GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano in October 2025. These are distilled variants of GPT-5 optimized for speed and cost. GPT-5-mini costs $0.80 per million input tokens and $2.40 per million output tokens. That is 27x cheaper than GPT-5. The performance is roughly equivalent to GPT-4 Turbo on most tasks. The context window is 128,000 tokens. The latency is lower: median time-to-first-token is 320 milliseconds compared to 580 milliseconds for GPT-5. GPT-5-nano costs $0.20 per million input tokens and $0.60 per million output tokens. That is 90x cheaper than GPT-5. The performance is roughly equivalent to GPT-3.5 Turbo. The context window is 64,000 tokens. The latency is even lower: median time-to-first-token is 180 milliseconds. The mini and nano variants are designed for high-volume, cost-sensitive tasks where GPT-5 performance is overkill. A customer support system that processes 100,000 requests per day would spend $2,800 per month on GPT-5-mini versus $154,000 on GPT-5. For most systems, the mini or nano variant is the right choice. You reserve GPT-5 or GPT-5.2 for the subset of requests that actually need frontier performance.

What is GPT-5 actually good at in production? First, reasoning-heavy tasks. GPT-5 outperforms every other model on multi-step logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and causal inference. If your task involves deriving conclusions from complex premises, generating formal proofs, or solving optimization problems, GPT-5 is the best option. A financial services company used GPT-5 to analyze regulatory filings and identify compliance risks. The task required understanding multi-paragraph legal definitions, cross-referencing clauses, and inferring implications. GPT-5 achieved 94% accuracy. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 89%. Gemini 3 Pro achieved 87%. The difference was GPT-5's ability to hold multiple constraints in working memory and reason through edge cases. Second, structured data extraction. GPT-5 excels at extracting structured data from unstructured text when the schema is complex or when the data requires interpretation. A healthcare company used GPT-5 to extract medication lists, dosages, and administration schedules from clinical notes. The notes were inconsistent and filled with abbreviations. GPT-5 achieved 96% accuracy. Gemini 3 Pro achieved 93%. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 91%. The difference was GPT-5's ability to disambiguate abbreviations and infer missing information from context.

What is GPT-5 not good at? Code generation. GPT-5 is competent at code generation but it does not match Claude Opus 4.5 or Claude Sonnet 4.5. A software company ran a comparison on generating API integration code in Python, JavaScript, and Go. Claude Opus 4.5 generated code that worked on the first attempt 82% of the time. GPT-5 generated code that worked on the first attempt 76% of the time. The difference was not large but it was consistent. Claude models are better at generating idiomatic code and handling edge cases in error handling. GPT-5 is also not optimal for long-document understanding when the task involves synthesizing information across many sections. Claude Opus 4.5 handles this better because it was explicitly optimized for long-context tasks. A legal technology company compared GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.5 on summarizing 100-page contracts. Claude Opus 4.5 summaries were more complete and missed fewer key clauses. GPT-5 summaries were accurate for individual sections but sometimes failed to connect clauses that were separated by many pages.

## Anthropic: Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5

Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 in May 2025, Claude Opus 4.1 in August 2025, and Claude Opus 4.5 in November 2025. The Opus 4.5 release was positioned as the safety-first frontier model. The training process emphasized constitutional AI, harmlessness, and refusal tuning. The model was designed to decline harmful requests without being overly cautious on benign requests. The benchmark performance was strong: Opus 4.5 matched GPT-5 on MMLU-Pro and exceeded it on HumanEval, achieving 91% compared to GPT-5's 85%. The context window was 400,000 tokens. The pricing was $15 per million input tokens and $45 per million output tokens. That made it cheaper than GPT-5 and significantly cheaper than GPT-5.2. The value proposition was clear: if you need the best code generation, the best long-document understanding, and strong safety guarantees, use Claude Opus 4.5.

What is Claude Opus 4.5 actually good at? First, code generation. Opus 4.5 is the best model for generating production-quality code in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. It generates idiomatic code, handles edge cases, includes appropriate error handling, and follows language-specific conventions. A software-as-a-service company used Opus 4.5 to generate API integration code for customer-facing features. The code worked on the first attempt 84% of the time. When it did not work, the errors were easy to fix. GPT-5 generated code that worked 76% of the time, but the errors were often subtle logic bugs that required deeper debugging. Gemini 3 Pro generated code that worked 72% of the time. The difference was not just success rate. The difference was that Opus 4.5 code was easier to read, easier to maintain, and closer to what a senior engineer would write.

Second, long-document understanding. Opus 4.5 excels at tasks that require synthesizing information across many pages of text. A legal technology company used Opus 4.5 to analyze contracts, extract key terms, and identify risks. The contracts were 80 to 150 pages long. Opus 4.5 achieved 97% accuracy on extracting key terms and 93% accuracy on identifying risks. GPT-5 achieved 94% on key terms and 89% on risks. The difference was Opus 4.5's ability to track cross-references and connect clauses that were separated by many pages. A healthcare company used Opus 4.5 to summarize patient histories from 50-page medical records. The summaries were more complete and included details from early sections that GPT-5 summaries often omitted. The long-context performance is a result of Anthropic's focus on maintaining coherence across very long inputs. Opus 4.5 was explicitly optimized for this.

Third, safety and refusal tuning. Opus 4.5 is the best model at declining harmful requests without being overly cautious. A social media company used Opus 4.5 to moderate user-generated content. The moderation task required distinguishing between legitimate criticism and harassment, between dark humor and hate speech, between medical information and harmful advice. Opus 4.5 achieved 96% accuracy. GPT-5 achieved 92%. Gemini 3 Pro achieved 89%. The difference was Opus 4.5's refusal tuning. It could recognize nuance in context. It could distinguish between a request to generate a phishing email as an example for a security training presentation versus a request to generate a phishing email for malicious use. GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro were more likely to refuse benign requests or approve harmful requests when the context was ambiguous. Opus 4.5 got the nuance right more often.

Anthropic also released Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 in November 2025. Sonnet 4.5 is a mid-tier model optimized for balanced performance and cost. It costs $3 per million input tokens and $9 per million output tokens. That is 5x cheaper than Opus 4.5. The performance is roughly equivalent to GPT-4o or Claude Opus 4 on most tasks. The context window is 256,000 tokens. Sonnet 4.5 is the model you use when you need strong performance but not the absolute best. A customer support company used Sonnet 4.5 to draft responses to complex support tickets. The quality was high enough that agents only needed to make minor edits. The cost was $4,200 per month for 15,000 tickets. Using Opus 4.5 would have cost $14,000 per month for marginal quality improvement. Sonnet 4.5 was the right tradeoff.

Haiku 4.5 is the fast, cheap variant. It costs $0.40 per million input tokens and $1.20 per million output tokens. That is 37x cheaper than Opus 4.5. The performance is roughly equivalent to GPT-3.5 Turbo or Claude Haiku 3.5. The context window is 128,000 tokens. The latency is very low: median time-to-first-token is 210 milliseconds. Haiku 4.5 is designed for high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks. A logistics company used Haiku 4.5 to generate shipment status summaries for customer emails. The task was simple. The volume was high: 80,000 emails per day. Haiku 4.5 cost $1,600 per month. Using Sonnet 4.5 would have cost $12,000 per month. Using Opus 4.5 would have cost $60,000 per month. Haiku 4.5 was fast enough and cheap enough. The quality was sufficient for the task. This is the pattern: use Opus 4.5 for tasks that need the best, use Sonnet 4.5 for tasks that need good, use Haiku 4.5 for tasks that need fast and cheap.

## Google: Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Deep Think

Google released Gemini 3 in November 2025. The release included two variants: Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Deep Think. Gemini 3 Pro is the general-purpose model optimized for multimodal tasks. It handles text, images, audio, and video in a single unified architecture. The context window is 2,000,000 tokens. That is 4x larger than GPT-5 and 5x larger than Claude Opus 4.5. The pricing is $7 per million input tokens and $21 per million output tokens for text. Image, audio, and video inputs are priced separately based on duration and resolution. The value proposition is clear: if you need multimodal understanding or if you need to process extremely long documents, use Gemini 3 Pro.

What is Gemini 3 Pro actually good at? First, visual understanding. Gemini 3 Pro is the best model for tasks that involve images, charts, diagrams, or visual data. A financial services company used Gemini 3 Pro to extract data from scanned financial statements. The statements included tables, charts, and handwritten notes. Gemini 3 Pro achieved 95% accuracy. GPT-4o with vision achieved 89%. Claude Opus 4.5 with vision achieved 87%. The difference was Gemini 3 Pro's ability to handle complex table structures, interpret charts, and recognize handwritten annotations. A healthcare company used Gemini 3 Pro to analyze medical images and generate radiology report summaries. The images included X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Gemini 3 Pro generated summaries that matched radiologist assessments 92% of the time. GPT-4o achieved 85%. The visual understanding is a result of Google's focus on multimodal training. Gemini 3 Pro was trained on a much larger corpus of image-text pairs than competing models.

Second, extremely long context. Gemini 3 Pro's 2,000,000-token context window enables tasks that are impossible with other models. A legal technology company used Gemini 3 Pro to analyze discovery documents in litigation. The documents totaled 1,200 pages. Gemini 3 Pro processed the entire corpus in a single request and generated a summary with key facts, timelines, and contradictions. Claude Opus 4.5 required splitting the corpus into chunks and synthesizing the results, which introduced errors. GPT-5 also required chunking. The ability to process the entire corpus in one pass eliminated chunking errors and improved coherence. A research company used Gemini 3 Pro to analyze 500-page technical reports and generate executive summaries. The summaries were more complete and more accurate than summaries generated by chunking and synthesizing with other models.

Third, multilingual performance. Gemini 3 Pro excels on non-English tasks, particularly on European and Asian languages. A global e-commerce company used Gemini 3 Pro to generate product descriptions in 24 languages. The quality was higher and more culturally appropriate than GPT-5 or Claude Opus 4.5. A customer support company used Gemini 3 Pro to answer customer questions in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin. The response quality was consistently high across languages. GPT-5 was strong on European languages but weaker on Japanese and Korean. Claude Opus 4.5 was strong on European languages but weaker on Mandarin. Gemini 3 Pro was strong on all of them. The multilingual performance is a result of Google's global training data and focus on internationalization.

Gemini 3 Deep Think is a reasoning-optimized variant released alongside Gemini 3 Pro. It uses a chain-of-thought architecture that generates intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer. The pricing is $12 per million input tokens and $36 per million output tokens. That is more expensive than Gemini 3 Pro but cheaper than GPT-5. The performance on reasoning tasks is strong. A financial services company used Gemini 3 Deep Think to analyze investment strategies and generate recommendations. The task required multi-step reasoning about risk, return, correlation, and market conditions. Gemini 3 Deep Think achieved 93% accuracy. GPT-5 achieved 94%. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 88%. Gemini 3 Pro achieved 86%. Deep Think was almost as good as GPT-5 at half the cost. For reasoning tasks where GPT-5 is overkill but Claude Opus 4.5 is not good enough, Gemini 3 Deep Think is the right choice.

## xAI: Grok 3 and Grok 4

xAI released Grok 3 in June 2025 and Grok 4 in December 2025. The models are positioned as real-time information synthesis engines integrated with X platform data. Grok 4 has access to live X posts, trends, and conversations. It can synthesize breaking news, analyze public sentiment, and generate responses informed by current events. The context window is 128,000 tokens. The pricing is $10 per million input tokens and $30 per million output tokens. That is mid-tier pricing, more expensive than Gemini 3 Pro but cheaper than GPT-5. The value proposition is real-time information access. If your task requires knowing what is happening right now or understanding current public discourse, Grok 4 is the only model that can do it natively.

What is Grok 4 actually good at? First, real-time information synthesis. A media company used Grok 4 to generate news summaries on breaking events. The model pulled live posts from X, identified credible sources, filtered out misinformation, and generated summaries within minutes of events happening. GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro do not have access to real-time data. They rely on static training data and retrieval-augmented generation systems that pull from indexed sources. Grok 4's live access to X data makes it faster and more current. A marketing company used Grok 4 to analyze brand sentiment during product launches. The model tracked mentions, identified sentiment trends, and generated reports on emerging issues. The reports were available within hours of launch. Competing approaches required scraping X data, processing it, and feeding it to another model. Grok 4 did it natively.

Second, understanding internet culture and slang. Grok 4 was trained on X data, which includes informal language, memes, slang, and evolving terminology. A social media company used Grok 4 to moderate user-generated content. The moderation task required understanding context-dependent slang and recognizing when a phrase was sarcastic, ironic, or literal. Grok 4 achieved 94% accuracy. GPT-5 achieved 88%. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 89%. The difference was Grok 4's familiarity with how language is actually used on social platforms. A customer support company used Grok 4 to interpret customer messages that included slang, abbreviations, and emojis. Grok 4 understood the intent more accurately than models trained primarily on formal text.

What is Grok 4 not good at? Long-form structured writing. Grok 4 is optimized for synthesis and analysis, not generation. A legal technology company compared Grok 4, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5 on generating contract clauses. Claude Opus 4.5 generated clauses that were legally precise and well-structured. GPT-5 generated clauses that were clear and complete. Grok 4 generated clauses that were acceptable but less polished. The difference was that Grok 4 was not optimized for formal writing. It was optimized for understanding and synthesizing informal, real-time text. A content marketing company compared the models on generating blog posts. Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5 generated posts that required minimal editing. Grok 4 generated posts that required more editing for tone and structure. Grok 4 is a specialist model. Use it for tasks that benefit from real-time data or understanding of internet culture. Do not use it as a general-purpose replacement for GPT-5 or Claude Opus 4.5.

## Positioning and Strengths Summary

Each provider positions their models differently and each model has different strengths. OpenAI positions GPT-5 and GPT-5.2 as the reasoning leaders. Use them for tasks that require multi-step logical reasoning, complex problem-solving, or structured data extraction from ambiguous inputs. They are expensive but they are the best at what they do. Anthropic positions Claude Opus 4.5 as the coding and safety leader. Use it for code generation, long-document understanding, and content moderation. It is cheaper than GPT-5 and better at those specific tasks. Google positions Gemini 3 Pro as the multimodal and long-context leader. Use it for tasks that involve images, extremely long documents, or multilingual content. It is the cheapest frontier model and the only one that handles 2,000,000-token inputs. xAI positions Grok 4 as the real-time information leader. Use it for tasks that require current data or understanding of internet culture.

The mistake most teams make is picking one model and using it for everything. A customer support system might use Claude Opus 4.5 for drafting complex responses, Gemini 3 Pro for analyzing screenshots, Grok 4 for understanding slang, and GPT-5-mini for simple triage. A document processing system might use Gemini 3 Pro for visual documents, GPT-5 for structured data extraction, and Claude Opus 4.5 for legal document summarization. The right model depends on the task. There is no single best model. There is only the best model for a specific task type, input format, output requirement, and cost constraint. That is why you need routing logic. That is why you need evaluation infrastructure. That is why model selection is an engineering discipline, not a product decision.

The next subchapter covers open-source models: Llama 4, DeepSeek V3.2, Qwen3, and when self-hosting makes sense versus using hosted APIs.
