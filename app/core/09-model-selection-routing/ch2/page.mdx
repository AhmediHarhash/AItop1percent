# Chapter 2 — Model Selection Methodology: Matching Models to Tasks

Knowing the landscape is not enough. You need a repeatable process for matching models to tasks with engineering rigor, not gut feeling, not benchmark chasing, not defaulting to whatever your team used last quarter. Model selection methodology turns the overwhelming landscape from Chapter 1 into a disciplined decision framework that accounts for cost, quality, latency, risk, and the specific demands of every task your system handles.

This chapter teaches the methodology. The cost-quality-latency triangle that governs every decision. Task taxonomy that maps your workload to model requirements. Risk tier mapping that prevents frontier-model waste on low-stakes tasks and cheap-model disasters on high-stakes ones. Eval suites, bake-offs, structured output testing, tool-calling fidelity, and instruction following assessment. By the end, you will have a repeatable decision matrix, a model decision record template, and the anti-pattern awareness to avoid the mistakes that waste months.

*The best model is not the one that scores highest on benchmarks. It is the one that scores highest on your tasks, within your budget, at the latency your users require.*
