# Model Selection and Routing

Choosing the right model for each task is the highest-leverage decision in production AI. Get it right and you ship fast, reliable, cost-efficient systems. Get it wrong and you burn budget on frontier models where a small model would suffice, or you ship a cheap model into a high-stakes workflow and watch trust collapse when it hallucinates under pressure. In 2026, with over a dozen frontier-class models, hundreds of open-weight variants, and pricing that changes quarterly, model selection is no longer a one-time choice. It is a continuous engineering discipline that determines whether your AI product succeeds or fails at scale.

This section covers model selection and routing across ten chapters and 135 subchapters. It is the definitive guide to choosing, evaluating, routing, optimizing, governing, and surviving the model landscape as it exists in January 2026.

## What This Section Covers

**Chapter 1 — The 2026 Model Landscape** maps the territory you are choosing from. Proprietary frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. Open-weight models from Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Mistral. Specialized models for code, medicine, law, and multilingual use. Reasoning models with extended thinking. Small models for edge and cost-sensitive deployment. Embedding models, multimodal models, and the provider landscape that hosts them all. You will learn why benchmark scores lie, how fast the landscape changes, and how to write model selection documentation that survives quarterly churn.

**Chapter 2 — Model Selection Methodology** teaches you how to match models to tasks with engineering rigor. The cost-quality-latency triangle. Task taxonomy. Risk tier mapping. Building eval suites, running bake-offs, evaluating structured output reliability, tool-calling fidelity, instruction following, and cross-provider behavior differences. You will learn the repeatable decision matrix, the model decision record, how to prevent eval overfitting, and the anti-patterns that waste months.

**Chapter 3 — Model Routing** covers sending the right query to the right model in production. Complexity-based, confidence-based, classifier-based, rule-based, semantic, risk-aware, cost-aware, and latency-aware routing strategies. Cascading architectures. Hybrid routing. Router evaluation, failure modes, observability, drift detection, and adversarial routing attacks. This chapter turns model selection from a static decision into a dynamic, query-level optimization.

**Chapter 4 — Cost Optimization** shows you how to get more from every token dollar. Token economics in 2026. Prompt compression. Response length control. Caching strategies including prompt caching, semantic caching, and KV cache reuse. Batch processing. Model distillation. Cost monitoring, alerting, allocation, and the diminishing returns curve that tells you when a better model is not worth the price. Enterprise agreement negotiation for volume discounts and reserved capacity.

**Chapter 5 — Latency and Reliability** covers meeting real-time expectations in production. Latency budgets. Streaming and time-to-first-token. Cold start behavior. Geographic routing. Edge deployment. Parallel model calls. Speculative decoding. Quantization tradeoffs. Latency monitoring. Timeout strategies. Rate limits, quota shaping, backpressure, and multi-region provider failover routing.

**Chapter 6 — Multi-Model Architectures** teaches you how to orchestrate multiple models in one system, which is the default architecture in 2026. Pipeline patterns. Orchestrator-worker patterns. Ensembles. Verifier-generator patterns. Multi-provider architectures. Tokenizer differences. Prompt portability layers. Multi-model testing, cost accounting, and the anti-patterns that over-engineer systems unnecessarily.

**Chapter 7 — Fine-Tuning vs Prompting vs RAG** covers the adaptation decision. When prompting is enough. When RAG adds knowledge the model lacks. When fine-tuning locks in behavior, style, or cost savings. Hybrid approaches. The fine-tuning decision checklist. Pitfalls including overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and eval drift. Distillation from frontier models. Continuous fine-tuning. The full adaptation stack.

**Chapter 8 — Open-Source vs Proprietary** covers the self-hosting decision. What changed in 2026. Data residency and compliance requirements. Self-hosting economics. Inference infrastructure with vLLM, TGI, Triton, and managed endpoints. Open-weight model quality. Vendor lock-in. Provider-agnostic abstractions. Hybrid architectures. Licensing. Total cost of self-hosting. Migration paths. Data routing policies.

**Chapter 9 — Model Lifecycle Management** teaches you how to survive deprecations and upgrades. The model lifecycle from release to end-of-life. Version pinning. Deprecation response playbooks. Migration testing. Backward compatibility with eval suites. Upgrade cadence. Shadow deployment. Canary rollouts. Provider outage preparedness. The model registry. Automated regression detection. A/B testing in production. Migration runbooks.

**Chapter 10 — Model Governance, Compliance, and Audit** covers the governance layer that enterprises require. Model approval processes. Model cards for production. EU AI Act GPAI obligations as of 2026. Audit trails. Compliance by design. Third-party model risk assessment. Bias and fairness evaluation. Data processing agreements. Retention and redaction rules. Policy compatibility testing. Incident response. Regulatory reporting. Cross-border considerations for global deployments.

## Who This Section Is For

This section is for engineers, architects, and engineering leaders who are responsible for choosing and operating models in production. If you are evaluating models for a new product, start with Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. If you are building a routing layer, start with Chapter 3. If you are managing cost or latency, start with Chapters 4 and 5. If you are preparing for an audit or compliance review, start with Chapter 10. Every chapter stands alone, but together they form the complete discipline of model selection and routing as it must be practiced in 2026.
