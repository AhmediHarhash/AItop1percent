# Chapter 4 — Cost Optimization: Getting More from Every Token Dollar

AI inference cost is the new cloud bill, and in 2026 it is growing faster than any other line item in most engineering budgets. The difference between teams that manage cost well and teams that do not is not frugality — it is engineering discipline. Cost optimization is not about using the cheapest model. It is about using the right model at the right time, with the right prompt, at the right batch size, with the right caching strategy, and knowing exactly where every dollar goes.

This chapter covers every cost optimization lever available in January 2026. Token economics and pricing models. Prompt compression. Response length control. Caching strategies from prompt caching to semantic caching to KV cache reuse. Batch processing. Model distillation. Cost monitoring, alerting, allocation, and the diminishing returns curve that tells you when a better model is not worth the price.
