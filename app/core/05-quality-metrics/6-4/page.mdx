# 6.4 — Healthcare AI: Clinical Accuracy and Patient Safety Metrics

On March 14, 2024, a regional hospital network in the Pacific Northwest deployed an AI-powered sepsis prediction system across its seven facilities. The system promised to identify sepsis cases twelve hours earlier than traditional clinical judgment, a breakthrough that could save dozens of lives annually across the network's 180,000 annual emergency department visits. The vendor's marketing materials boasted 94 percent accuracy and validation across 50,000 patient encounters. Within eight weeks, the hospital's risk management team documented eleven cases where the AI failed to flag patients who later developed severe sepsis, three of whom died. The system also generated 847 false alarms in the same period, training clinicians to ignore its alerts. By June, the hospital had disabled the system and faced three wrongful death lawsuits. The total cost—legal settlements, reputational damage, and implementation expenses—exceeded eight million dollars. The root cause was not a technical failure but a metrics failure: the vendor had optimized for overall accuracy rather than the asymmetric costs of false negatives in a life-threatening condition.

Healthcare AI operates in an environment where metrics must encode the fundamental reality that errors kill people. You cannot treat a medical AI system like a consumer recommendation engine or a content moderation tool. The consequences of failure are measured not in user frustration or brand damage but in morbidity and mortality. This reality transforms every aspect of how you define, measure, and optimize quality in healthcare applications. Your metrics must reflect the profound ethical weight of clinical decision-making, the regulatory scrutiny of medical devices, and the operational complexity of healthcare delivery systems where AI sits alongside human experts who bear ultimate responsibility for patient outcomes.

## The Inadequacy of General Accuracy Metrics in Clinical Settings

Overall accuracy is a dangerous metric in healthcare AI because it obscures the asymmetric costs of different error types. A system that predicts hospital readmissions with 92 percent accuracy might sound impressive until you realize that it achieves this by predicting that almost no patients will be readmitted, which happens to be correct 92 percent of the time. The system misses nearly every actual readmission case, rendering it clinically useless. This phenomenon—where high accuracy masks catastrophic failure on the rare but critical cases—pervades healthcare AI. You must abandon accuracy as your primary quality signal and instead build metrics around the specific clinical decisions your system supports and the specific harms it might cause.

The fundamental challenge is that healthcare involves highly imbalanced datasets where the most important outcomes are rare. Sepsis occurs in fewer than 2 percent of emergency department visits. Pulmonary embolism appears in fewer than 5 percent of patients with chest pain. Pediatric brain tumors account for less than 0.01 percent of headache presentations. If you optimize for accuracy on these tasks, your model learns to predict that nothing bad ever happens, achieving impressive accuracy numbers while providing zero clinical value. You need metrics that focus specifically on the system's ability to identify the rare critical cases, even if this means accepting lower overall accuracy. The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity must be driven by clinical consequences, not mathematical convenience.

## Clinical Accuracy Metrics That Match Medical Decision-Making

**Sensitivity** and **specificity** form the foundation of clinically meaningful performance measurement, but only when you set thresholds based on the clinical context rather than mathematical optimization. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positive cases that your system correctly identifies—how many true sepsis cases it catches, how many cancers it detects on imaging. Specificity measures the proportion of actual negative cases that your system correctly classifies—how many non-urgent chest pains it correctly identifies as low-risk, how many benign skin lesions it recognizes as harmless. The critical insight is that you cannot optimize both simultaneously, and the right balance depends entirely on the clinical stakes.

For a cancer screening system, you typically prioritize sensitivity over specificity because the cost of a missed cancer—death—vastly exceeds the cost of a false alarm—an unnecessary biopsy. You might accept specificity of 70 percent to achieve sensitivity of 95 percent, meaning you generate many false alarms but rarely miss actual cancers. For a system that recommends emergency surgery, you invert this priority: the cost of unnecessary surgery is severe enough that you need very high specificity, even if this means the system misses some true surgical cases that clinicians will catch through other means. The metrics must encode these clinical trade-offs explicitly. You do not simply report sensitivity and specificity; you define clinically acceptable ranges based on the harm model for your specific application and treat violations as quality failures.

**Positive predictive value** and **negative predictive value** translate sensitivity and specificity into the terms that matter for clinical workflow: when your system says something is present, how often is it actually present, and when your system says something is absent, how often is it actually absent. PPV is particularly crucial for alert systems because it directly determines whether clinicians will trust your system's alarms. If your sepsis prediction system has a PPV of 15 percent, meaning only one in seven alerts represents actual sepsis, clinicians will quickly learn to ignore the alerts, rendering the system worse than useless—it consumes attention without providing value and may mask the real signals in the noise. You need PPV above 40 percent for most alert systems to maintain clinical credibility, and above 60 percent for high-stakes interventions.

These metrics must be computed not just overall but within clinically relevant subgroups. A diabetic retinopathy screening system might perform well in general but fail systematically in patients with age-related macular degeneration, where the pathology overlaps and confuses the model. An ECG interpretation system might excel on middle-aged adults but miss dangerous arrhythmias in pediatric patients, whose normal values differ substantially. You need to stratify performance by age, sex, comorbidities, disease severity, and any other dimension that affects clinical presentation. A system that achieves 90 percent sensitivity overall but only 60 percent sensitivity in Black patients is not a 90 percent sensitivity system—it is a biased system that fails a significant patient population and creates disparate health outcomes.

## Patient Safety Metrics Beyond Diagnostic Accuracy

Healthcare AI failures extend far beyond missed diagnoses to encompass the full spectrum of patient safety risks that medical interventions create. You must measure not just whether your system gets the right answer but whether it creates new risks in the process of providing clinical support. **Alert fatigue** represents one of the most insidious safety risks: when your system generates too many alerts, clinicians become desensitized and miss critical warnings buried in the noise. You need metrics that track alert rates, alert override rates, and time-to-acknowledgment. If clinicians are overriding more than 85 percent of your alerts, or if acknowledgment times are increasing over time, your system is training users to ignore it, which creates risk for the cases where the alert is accurate.

**False alarm rates** must be measured in terms of clinical consequences, not just raw numbers. A false alarm that triggers an unnecessary CT scan exposes the patient to radiation and contrast dye reactions. A false alarm that triggers emergency surgery creates surgical risk and recovery burden. A false alarm that suggests a patient is low-risk when they are actually high-risk might delay necessary intervention. You need to track not just the frequency of false alarms but their downstream effects: unnecessary tests ordered, inappropriate medications prescribed, delayed interventions, extended lengths of stay. Each false alarm type has a different harm profile, and your metrics must weight them accordingly.

**Missed diagnosis patterns** reveal systematic weaknesses that raw sensitivity numbers obscure. If your system consistently misses sepsis in patients whose initial vital signs are borderline but who deteriorate rapidly, you have identified a specific failure mode that requires targeted improvement. If your radiology AI misses cancers that appear at the edge of the image frame, you have discovered a systematic error that might affect specific scanner types or imaging protocols. You need to track not just how many cases you miss but which types of cases you miss, looking for patterns in patient demographics, disease subtypes, presentation timing, and clinical context. These patterns drive meaningful improvement far more effectively than aggregate sensitivity numbers.

**Inappropriate treatment suggestions** represent a distinct category of safety risk where the AI recommends an intervention that would harm the patient. A sepsis protocol system that recommends aggressive fluid resuscitation for a patient with congestive heart failure could trigger pulmonary edema. A medication dosing system that fails to account for renal insufficiency could cause toxic overdoses. An ICU monitoring system that recommends sedation for agitation without recognizing delirium could worsen cognitive outcomes. You must track every instance where clinical experts override your system's recommendations due to safety concerns, analyzing these cases to identify systematic errors in the AI's clinical reasoning. The rate of safety-based overrides is itself a critical quality metric—it should be low and stable, not climbing over time.

## Regulatory Requirements and Clinical Validation Standards

The Food and Drug Administration's regulatory framework for medical AI devices establishes specific performance standards that translate into quality metrics you must track continuously. For Class II devices—which includes most clinical decision support systems—you need to demonstrate **substantial equivalence** to existing cleared devices or provide clinical validation through studies that meet FDA standards for statistical rigor and clinical relevance. This means your metrics must enable comparison to the performance of existing clinical tools, not just abstract accuracy thresholds. If you are building an AI system to interpret chest X-rays, your metrics must show how your system compares to radiologist performance, ideally demonstrating non-inferiority at minimum and superiority if you want to claim clinical advantage.

The FDA's 2024 guidance on predetermined change control plans for AI systems introduces the concept of continuous validation metrics that must remain within pre-specified bounds even as the model learns from new data. You define an **acceptable performance envelope** at initial clearance—for instance, sensitivity between 88 and 95 percent and specificity between 82 and 91 percent across five demographic subgroups—and your ongoing metrics must demonstrate that model updates stay within this envelope. If performance drifts outside the envelope, you must halt deployment and file a new 510(k) submission. This transforms metrics from a development tool into a regulatory compliance requirement that gates every model update. You need automated monitoring systems that compute these metrics continuously and trigger alerts when performance approaches envelope boundaries.

**Clinical validation studies** require specific statistical methodologies that differ substantially from typical machine learning evaluation. You need prospective studies where the AI's predictions are compared to subsequent clinical outcomes or to expert consensus interpretations established independently. Retrospective studies on historical data are necessary but insufficient—the FDA requires prospective validation to demonstrate that the system performs in real clinical conditions with all the noise, ambiguity, and edge cases that retrospective datasets sanitize away. Your metrics must track not just the AI's raw predictions but inter-rater agreement with clinical experts, which establishes whether the AI is making decisions within the range of acceptable medical judgment or venturing into clinically indefensible territory.

The **EU Medical Device Regulation** adds additional layers of post-market surveillance requirements that demand continuous metrics tracking across deployed systems. You must maintain a **post-market surveillance plan** that specifies which metrics you will monitor, how often you will analyze them, what thresholds trigger investigation, and how you will report findings to notified bodies and competent authorities. This means your metrics infrastructure must be production-grade from day one, not a development convenience you can defer. You need pipelines that collect performance data from every deployment site, aggregate it centrally, compute standardized metrics, and generate reports that meet regulatory format requirements. The burden is substantial, but it is non-negotiable for any healthcare AI that qualifies as a medical device.

## Real-Time Performance Monitoring in Clinical Deployments

Healthcare AI systems must include continuous performance monitoring that operates in production alongside the AI itself, measuring quality in real clinical workflows rather than static test sets. **Prediction-outcome matching** tracks whether the AI's predictions correspond to subsequent clinical findings and patient outcomes. If your system predicts high sepsis risk, you track whether the patient is subsequently diagnosed with sepsis, receives sepsis treatment, or shows sepsis-related complications. This requires integrating your metrics pipeline with EHR systems to capture structured outcome data, clinical notes that document diagnoses, laboratory results that confirm predictions, and procedure records that show which interventions occurred. The latency between prediction and outcome varies—sepsis outcomes emerge within 24-72 hours, while cancer screening outcomes may require months or years—so your metrics infrastructure must handle multiple timescales.

**Confidence calibration** in clinical settings requires special attention because clinicians use predicted probabilities to make risk-based decisions. If your system reports 30 percent risk of readmission, and among all patients with 30 percent predicted risk the actual readmission rate is 45 percent, your system is miscalibrated in a way that will lead to poor clinical decisions. You need to track calibration continuously across the full probability range, checking whether predicted probabilities match observed frequencies. In healthcare, you often encounter significant domain shift between training data and deployment populations—patients at academic medical centers differ from community hospital patients, regional disease prevalence varies, local practice patterns affect outcomes—so calibration that was perfect in development may degrade in production. Your metrics must detect this drift and trigger recalibration procedures before systematic miscalibration affects clinical decisions.

**Clinician override patterns** provide direct feedback on whether your system's recommendations align with expert clinical judgment. You track how often clinicians accept, modify, or completely override the AI's suggestions, analyzing override cases to understand whether they represent AI errors, clinician errors, or legitimate differences in clinical judgment. Rising override rates signal declining trust or systematic errors. Systematic override patterns—such as always overriding the AI's risk assessments for a specific patient subgroup—reveal bias or systematic errors that aggregate metrics miss. You need qualitative review of override cases, not just quantitative tracking, to understand the clinical reasoning behind rejection of AI recommendations. This feedback loop must inform model improvement: systematic override patterns should trigger targeted model updates that address the specific clinical scenarios where human experts consistently disagree with the AI.

**Harm event tracking** connects AI performance to actual patient harm through systematic review of adverse events, near misses, and patient safety reports. When a patient experiences an unexpected outcome, you investigate whether the AI contributed—through a missed diagnosis, inappropriate recommendation, false alarm that distracted from the real problem, or interface design that made it difficult to interpret the AI's output correctly. This requires integrating your metrics with the hospital's patient safety reporting systems and incident review processes. You cannot wait for formal investigations to complete; you need near-real-time flagging of cases where AI involvement might have contributed to harm, triggering immediate review by a clinical safety committee that includes AI expertise. The rate of harm events attributable to AI should trend toward zero, and any increase demands immediate investigation and potential deployment suspension.

## Comparative Effectiveness and Clinical Utility Metrics

Healthcare AI must demonstrate not just that it works in isolation but that it improves outcomes compared to existing clinical practice. **Comparative effectiveness** metrics evaluate whether care delivered with AI assistance produces better patient outcomes than care delivered without it. This requires randomized controlled trials or sophisticated quasi-experimental designs that account for confounding factors. You might compare diagnostic accuracy in cases reviewed by radiologists alone versus radiologists assisted by AI, or compare readmission rates for patients whose discharge planning included AI-powered risk stratification versus usual care. These studies are expensive and time-consuming, but they are essential for establishing clinical value rather than just technical performance.

**Clinical utility** extends beyond accuracy to measure whether the AI actually changes clinical decisions in ways that improve care. A cancer detection system with 95 percent sensitivity has no clinical utility if it only detects cancers that radiologists would have detected anyway. Clinical utility requires that the AI either identifies cases that would otherwise be missed, enables correct identification with less cost or invasiveness, or accelerates diagnosis in time-sensitive conditions. You measure this through decision impact analysis: what proportion of AI-flagged cases were not initially flagged by clinicians, what proportion of AI-cleared cases avoided unnecessary workup, how much sooner did AI-assisted diagnosis occur compared to standard timelines. Clinical utility metrics determine whether the AI justifies its cost and complexity in real healthcare delivery.

**Time-to-treatment** metrics capture whether AI accelerates critical clinical pathways where speed affects outcomes. For stroke, every minute of delay increases disability and mortality. For sepsis, every hour of delay in antibiotic administration increases mortality by several percentage points. If your AI identifies these conditions earlier than standard workflows, you need to measure the time savings and translate it into outcome improvements. This requires tracking not just when the AI generates an alert but when that alert leads to clinical action—diagnostic imaging ordered, antibiotics administered, specialist consulted. The time from AI alert to clinical action reveals whether the AI is actually integrated into workflow or generating alerts that languish unnoticed in EHR inboxes.

**Resource utilization** metrics assess whether AI improves the efficiency of care delivery or simply adds another layer of cost and complexity. You track the number of unnecessary tests avoided due to AI-powered risk stratification, the reduction in specialist consultations for cases the AI correctly triaged as low-risk, the decrease in hospital length of stay from earlier discharge planning. You also track the new costs the AI introduces: additional imaging when the AI flags borderline cases that would not have been worked up, increased specialist time spent reviewing AI alerts, technical infrastructure and maintenance costs. The net resource impact determines whether the AI creates economic value for the healthcare system, which increasingly drives adoption decisions as healthcare organizations face financial pressure.

## Subgroup Performance and Health Equity Metrics

Healthcare AI has the potential to either reduce or exacerbate health disparities, and your metrics must explicitly measure performance across demographic and social groups to ensure equitable outcomes. **Demographic stratification** requires computing all performance metrics—sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, calibration—separately for subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, sex, age, insurance status, primary language, and zip code-level socioeconomic indicators. You should see similar performance across these subgroups. Systematic differences—such as lower sensitivity for Black patients or higher false alarm rates for Medicaid beneficiaries—indicate bias that will worsen existing health disparities. You must treat meaningful performance gaps as quality failures that block deployment until resolved, not as interesting findings to mention in a paper.

**Representation analysis** tracks whether your training data includes sufficient examples from all patient subgroups to enable robust learning. If your chest X-ray AI trained on data from three academic medical centers that serve predominantly white, commercially-insured populations, it may fail systematically on patients from safety-net hospitals who have different disease prevalence, comorbidity patterns, and imaging characteristics. You need metrics that quantify training data composition and compare it to the demographic distribution of your deployment population. Significant mismatches demand either data augmentation to improve representation or explicit scope limitations that prevent deployment in populations inadequately represented in training. You cannot assume that models generalize across demographic groups; you must validate generalization empirically.

**Outcome disparity tracking** extends beyond prediction performance to measure whether AI-assisted care produces equitable patient outcomes. Even if your model achieves identical accuracy across demographic groups, it might still worsen disparities if clinicians are less likely to act on AI recommendations for certain patient populations, if the AI's interface design is less effective for non-English speakers, or if the clinical pathways the AI optimizes for are themselves inequitable. You need to track actual clinical actions taken and patient outcomes achieved, stratified by demographic groups, to ensure that the AI produces equitable benefit. This requires long-term longitudinal tracking that follows patients from AI-assisted diagnosis through treatment completion and outcome measurement.

**Fairness metrics** from algorithmic fairness literature must be adapted to clinical contexts where equal error rates may not represent equal harm. **Equalized odds**—requiring equal true positive rates and false positive rates across groups—sounds fair but may not be optimal if baseline disease prevalence differs across groups. **Predictive parity**—requiring equal PPV across groups—may be more clinically meaningful because it ensures that when the AI flags a patient from any demographic group, the probability of true disease is equivalent. However, mathematical fairness definitions often conflict with each other; you cannot simultaneously achieve all of them. You must choose fairness criteria based on the clinical harm model and the specific disparities you aim to prevent, then track those metrics rigorously across all deployments.

## Integration with Clinical Workflow and Human Oversight

Healthcare AI rarely operates autonomously; it provides decision support to clinicians who retain ultimate responsibility for patient care. Your metrics must therefore measure not just the AI's isolated performance but the performance of the human-AI system as a whole. **Decision support effectiveness** tracks whether clinicians make better decisions when assisted by AI compared to their unaided performance. This requires prospective studies where you measure diagnostic accuracy, treatment appropriateness, and patient outcomes for clinicians working with and without AI assistance. Ideally, the AI improves performance across all clinicians, but particularly brings lower-performing clinicians closer to expert-level performance, reducing practice variation and improving overall quality.

**Appropriate reliance** measures whether clinicians trust the AI the right amount—neither over-relying on incorrect AI recommendations nor under-utilizing correct AI insights. You track cases where clinicians followed AI recommendations that turned out to be wrong (over-reliance errors) and cases where they ignored AI recommendations that turned out to be correct (under-reliance errors). The balance between these error types depends on the clinical context. For screening applications where the AI provides a second opinion, under-reliance is relatively safe because the clinician's judgment prevails. For time-sensitive emergencies where the AI might detect patterns clinicians miss, under-reliance is more dangerous. Your metrics must characterize the reliance patterns that emerge in practice and identify systematic deviations from optimal reliance levels.

**Interface usability** affects clinical safety as much as model performance because poorly designed interfaces lead clinicians to misinterpret AI outputs or fail to notice critical alerts. You need metrics that track how long clinicians spend reviewing AI outputs, how often they request additional information or explanations, how often they misinterpret confidence scores or visualizations, and how interface interactions correlate with clinical decisions. High time costs suggest the interface imposes excessive burden, potentially leading clinicians to skip review entirely. Frequent misinterpretation of outputs suggests interface design failures that undermine the AI's value even when its predictions are correct. These metrics require specialized user research methods—think-aloud protocols, eye tracking, simulated clinical scenarios—that complement the quantitative performance metrics.

**Documentation compliance** measures whether clinicians properly document their use of AI in clinical decision-making, which is essential for legal liability, quality review, and future analysis. When a clinician orders a medication change based on an AI recommendation, they should document that the AI contributed to the decision, what the AI recommended, and why they agreed or disagreed with that recommendation. Poor documentation creates liability risk—it is unclear whether the AI or the clinician made the critical decision—and prevents learning from clinical experience. You need to track documentation completeness and quality, integrating with EHR audit logs to identify cases where AI was used but not documented, and working with clinical leadership to improve documentation practices.

## Continuous Validation and Model Lifecycle Management

Healthcare AI models degrade over time as clinical practice evolves, disease patterns shift, and patient populations change. **Concept drift detection** tracks whether the statistical relationships the model learned during training remain valid in production. You monitor the distribution of input features—patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory values, imaging characteristics—and compare them to training data distributions. Significant drift suggests the model may no longer be operating in its validated domain. You also monitor performance metrics over time, looking for gradual degradation that indicates the model's learned patterns no longer match current reality. This requires establishing baseline performance during initial deployment and computing ongoing metrics with sufficient frequency to detect meaningful changes before they affect patient care.

**Retraining triggers** define the conditions under which you must retrain the model on updated data to maintain performance. You might trigger retraining when performance metrics drift outside acceptable bounds, when input distributions shift beyond a threshold distance from training data, when new medical evidence changes clinical practice, or on a fixed schedule that ensures the model never operates on data more than a certain age. Each retraining cycle requires complete revalidation—computing all quality metrics on held-out test data, comparing to previous model versions, documenting changes, and updating regulatory submissions if required. This makes retraining expensive, so you cannot do it frivolously, but delaying necessary retraining creates patient safety risk, so you cannot be too conservative either.

**Version control and rollback capability** are essential for managing risk in deployed healthcare AI. You must track which model version is deployed at each site, which patients were evaluated by which version, and maintain the capability to instantly roll back to a previous version if the current version exhibits unexpected behavior. This requires sophisticated deployment infrastructure that can serve multiple model versions simultaneously, route traffic based on site-specific configurations, and switch versions without service interruption. When you detect a performance problem, you need metrics that identify which model version introduced the problem, which patients were affected, and what clinical impact resulted. This enables targeted clinical review and remediation rather than organization-wide panic.

**Post-market surveillance reporting** to regulatory authorities requires aggregating metrics across all deployment sites and reporting them in standardized formats. The FDA's Medical Device Reporting regulations require reporting serious injuries or malfunctions within specific timeframes—typically 30 days for serious injury, 5 days for death. This means your metrics infrastructure must include automated flagging of potential reportable events, rapid investigation protocols, and reporting workflows that meet regulatory timelines. You cannot wait for quarterly reviews to discover serious safety signals; you need daily monitoring with escalation procedures that engage clinical leadership and regulatory affairs immediately when concerning patterns emerge.

## Building a Culture of Clinical Quality and Safety

Metrics alone do not ensure healthcare AI safety; they must be embedded in organizational processes that value patient safety above commercial pressure or technical elegance. You need **clinical advisory boards** that include practicing physicians, nurses, and patient advocates who review metrics regularly, interpret them in clinical context, and have authority to halt deployment if safety concerns arise. These boards cannot be rubber stamps; they must include experts with genuine clinical credibility who understand both the AI's technical operation and the clinical workflows it affects. Their review cycles must be frequent enough to catch emerging problems—monthly at minimum, weekly for newly deployed systems—and their findings must drive immediate action, not just documentation.

**Safety culture** in healthcare AI means that anyone on the team—engineers, data scientists, product managers, clinical staff—can raise safety concerns without fear of retaliation and with confidence that concerns will be investigated promptly. You need formal mechanisms for reporting safety concerns, investigation protocols that determine whether concerns represent true risks, and feedback loops that inform the reporter what actions were taken. This parallels the safety reporting systems that hospitals use for medical errors, adapted to the AI development context. Over time, you track the rate of safety concerns raised, the proportion that represent true risks, and the time from report to resolution. A healthy safety culture generates a steady stream of concerns—it means people are watching carefully—while most concerns are minor issues caught early before they affect patients.

**Transparency with clinical partners** means sharing your metrics honestly, including negative results and performance limitations, rather than presenting only favorable findings. Clinicians need to understand where the AI is reliable and where it struggles so they can calibrate their trust appropriately. This transparency builds credibility and psychological safety: clinicians trust that you will tell them about problems rather than hiding them, which makes them more likely to report issues they observe and more willing to collaborate on improvement. You publish regular performance reports to clinical partners, including stratified metrics, drift analysis, and comparison to baseline performance. These reports should be accessible to frontline clinicians, not just department chairs, because frontline staff are the ones who observe the AI's behavior in context and can provide the most valuable feedback.

The metrics and practices that enable safe healthcare AI reflect the profound responsibility you accept when your work affects human life. You measure performance with clinical rigor, monitor deployments with regulatory discipline, engage clinical experts with genuine humility, and prioritize patient safety over every other consideration. These practices are demanding, but they are the only path to healthcare AI that fulfills its promise to improve clinical outcomes rather than creating new risks that undermine patient trust and clinician confidence. The next subchapter examines how financial services AI requires similarly rigorous metrics, though focused on risk management, auditability, and regulatory compliance rather than patient safety.
