# Chapter 2 — Deep Dive into Quality Dimensions

Each quality dimension represents a distinct way your system can fail or succeed. You cannot reduce correctness, safety, and latency into a single score without hiding the trade-offs that define your product's character and constraints.

- **2.1** — Correctness: Factual Accuracy and Logical Validity
- **2.2** — Groundedness: Attribution, Citation, and Source Fidelity
- **2.3** — Completeness: Coverage Without Bloat
- **2.4** — Usefulness: Task Completion and User Goal Alignment
- **2.5** — Safety: Harm Prevention, Toxicity, and Bias
- **2.6** — Robustness: Consistency Under Adversarial and Edge-Case Inputs
- **2.7** — Coherence and Consistency: Within and Across Turns
- **2.8** — Latency: Time-to-First-Token, End-to-End, and Perceived Speed
- **2.9** — Cost Efficiency: Dollars per Quality Unit
- **2.10** — Tone, Style, and Brand Alignment
- **2.11** — Transparency and Explainability
- **2.12** — Dimension Interactions: When Improving One Degrades Another

*We begin with correctness, the dimension most teams think they understand but measure poorly.*
