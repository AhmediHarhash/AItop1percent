# 4.12 — Fine-Tuned Model Evaluation Metrics

On October 22, 2025, a customer support automation company completed fine-tuning GPT-4o on 14,000 examples of their support conversations. The fine-tuned model achieved 94 percent accuracy on their customer intent classification task, up from 81 percent with the base model and few-shot prompting. The team celebrated the 13 percentage point improvement and rolled the model into production across 40 enterprise clients handling approximately 120,000 support tickets per month. Within three weeks, they received complaints from eight clients. The issue was not intent classification accuracy, which remained high. The problem was that the fine-tuned model had become rigid and unhelpful in conversations that deviated even slightly from training examples. When customers asked questions using unusual phrasing or requested help with edge-case scenarios, the model would fail to provide useful responses despite correctly classifying intent. A customer might say "I am trying to understand why my invoice shows this charge" and the model would correctly classify it as a billing inquiry but then respond with generic billing information instead of actually explaining the specific charge. The base model with prompting had handled these variations gracefully. The fine-tuned model had lost flexibility while gaining accuracy.

The company rolled back the fine-tuned model on November 18 and spent six weeks rebuilding their evaluation framework. The lesson was painful: fine-tuning optimization changes what models can do in ways that go far beyond the specific task you are optimizing for. You cannot evaluate a fine-tuned model by only measuring the task you fine-tuned it for. You must measure what capabilities you preserved, what you degraded, and whether the specialization gain justifies the generalization loss.

## The Alignment Tax: What General Capabilities Did Fine-Tuning Degrade

**Alignment tax** refers to the degradation in general capabilities that occurs when you fine-tune a model for a specific task. Every update to model weights that makes it better at your specialized task potentially makes it worse at tasks it could handle before. Measuring this tax is critical to understanding the true cost of fine-tuning.

A legal document drafting company in early 2025 fine-tuned Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 8,000 annotated legal contracts to improve clause generation and compliance checking. The fine-tuned model improved legal accuracy from 83 percent to 91 percent on their benchmark. But they started receiving complaints that the model's general writing quality had decreased. When asked to draft emails, summarize meeting notes, or explain concepts to non-lawyers, the fine-tuned model produced awkward, overly formal text that felt unnatural.

The team ran a comprehensive benchmark suite comparing the base model to their fine-tuned version across tasks they had not optimized for: creative writing, code generation, math reasoning, question answering, summarization, and translation. The results revealed systematic degradation. Creative writing quality dropped from 7.8 to 6.2 on human preference scores. Code generation accuracy fell from 76 percent to 68 percent. Math reasoning dropped from 81 percent to 74 percent. Summarization quality decreased from 8.1 to 7.3. Translation remained relatively stable, dropping only from 42 to 41 BLEU score.

The alignment tax was not uniform across capabilities. Tasks that were semantically distant from legal drafting, like creative writing and code generation, degraded most. Tasks that shared some characteristics with legal text, like formal summarization, degraded less. This pattern suggested the fine-tuning process was shifting the model's general language understanding toward legal formality patterns, degrading its ability to handle informal or creative language.

Measuring alignment tax requires establishing a baseline of general capabilities before fine-tuning, then re-evaluating those same capabilities after fine-tuning. You need a diverse benchmark suite covering capabilities your users might need beyond your specialized task. The legal drafting company built a standard evaluation set with 100 examples each across 8 general capabilities, running this full suite before and after every fine-tuning iteration.

They discovered that alignment tax increased with more fine-tuning steps. After 500 training steps, general capabilities had degraded by an average of 6 percent. After 2,000 steps, degradation reached 14 percent. After 5,000 steps, it hit 22 percent. There was a tradeoff curve: more fine-tuning improved specialized performance but degraded general capability faster.

## Specialization Depth: How Much Did Task-Specific Quality Improve

**Specialization depth** measures how much fine-tuning improved performance on your target task beyond what the base model with optimal prompting could achieve. This quantifies the value you are buying with your alignment tax.

A medical transcription company in mid-2025 fine-tuned Whisper for medical terminology recognition. The base Whisper model with standard prompting achieved 87 percent word error rate on medical terms. They tried advanced prompting with medical context and terminology lists, reaching 84 percent WER. Then they fine-tuned on 12,000 hours of medical audio with transcriptions, achieving 79 percent WER.

The specialization gain from basic prompting to advanced prompting was 3 percentage points. The gain from advanced prompting to fine-tuning was 5 percentage points. The total specialization depth was 8 percentage points, which seemed substantial. But when they measured the full picture including alignment tax, they found that fine-tuning had degraded general transcription performance from 92 percent to 88 percent WER on non-medical audio. They gained 5 points on medical terminology but lost 4 points on general transcription.

Was this trade-off worthwhile? It depended on their use case. For a product exclusively transcribing medical audio, the trade-off was favorable. For a general transcription service that needed to handle both medical and non-medical content, the trade-off was questionable. They might achieve better overall quality by using the base model with advanced prompting despite lower peak performance on medical terms.

Measuring specialization depth requires comparing multiple baselines. You need performance of the base model with zero-shot prompting, with few-shot prompting, with optimal prompting strategies, and with fine-tuning. The difference between optimal prompting and fine-tuning is the true specialization gain, after accounting for what you could achieve without fine-tuning at all.

The medical transcription team ran a systematic comparison: base model with no medical prompting scored 87 percent WER on medical terms. Base model with medical terminology list in the prompt scored 84 percent. Base model with example medical transcriptions in context scored 82 percent. Fine-tuned model scored 79 percent. The incremental gain from fine-tuning over the best prompting approach was only 3 percentage points, substantially less than the 8-point gap versus naive baseline.

This analysis revealed that much of what looked like specialization gain from fine-tuning was actually just gain from providing task-specific information, which could be achieved through prompting. The true value-add of fine-tuning was smaller than initially measured.

## Generalization Breadth: Does the Fine-Tuned Model Handle Adjacent Tasks

Fine-tuning on narrow task distributions can create models that perform well on training-like examples but fail on related tasks they should be able to handle. **Generalization breadth** measures how well the fine-tuned model handles variations and adjacent tasks.

A sentiment analysis company in late 2025 fine-tuned a model on product reviews from e-commerce platforms to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Training data consisted of short reviews (average 24 words) in informal language about consumer products. The fine-tuned model achieved 93 percent accuracy on held-out reviews matching the training distribution.

Then customers started using the model for adjacent sentiment tasks: analyzing customer service call transcripts (longer, more formal), social media posts about brands (shorter, with slang and hashtags), employee feedback surveys (different domain), and news article sentiment about companies (journalistic style). Performance collapsed. Call transcripts: 71 percent accuracy. Social media: 68 percent. Employee surveys: 74 percent. News articles: 69 percent.

The model had specialized so narrowly on short informal product reviews that it lost the ability to handle sentiment analysis more broadly. The base model, which had never been fine-tuned, achieved 82 percent accuracy on product reviews and 79, 77, 81, and 78 percent on the adjacent tasks respectively. It was less specialized but more generalizable. The fine-tuned model was better on the specific training distribution but worse on everything adjacent.

Measuring generalization breadth requires building test sets covering the distribution around your target task. For sentiment analysis, this includes variations in text length, formality, domain, and linguistic style. For each dimension, you measure how performance degrades as you move away from the training distribution.

The sentiment analysis team built a generalization breadth benchmark with five axes of variation from their training distribution: text length (short/medium/long), formality (casual/neutral/formal), domain (products/services/experiences/entities), sentiment clarity (obvious/mixed/subtle), and linguistic style (standard/slang/technical). Each combination created a distinct test condition. They measured accuracy in each condition, comparing the fine-tuned model to the base model.

The analysis revealed that the fine-tuned model's advantage disappeared quickly as test conditions diverged from training. When examples matched the training distribution on all five dimensions, the fine-tuned model won by 11 percentage points. When examples differed on one dimension, the advantage dropped to 7 points. Two dimensions: 3 points. Three or more dimensions: the base model actually performed better. The fine-tuned model had traded generalization breadth for specialization depth, and the trade-off only favored fine-tuning for a narrow distribution of inputs.

## Overfitting Detection: Memorization Versus Pattern Learning

Fine-tuned models can memorize training examples rather than learning general patterns. **Overfitting detection metrics** distinguish whether your model is genuinely better at the task or just recalling training data.

A code generation company in early 2026 fine-tuned a model on internal company codebases to help developers write code consistent with their architectural patterns and style guidelines. The fine-tuned model achieved 88 percent correctness on an internal evaluation set. But developers reported strange behavior: the model would sometimes generate code snippets that were nearly identical to existing code in the codebase, including variable names and comments, even when the context did not call for that specific pattern.

The team ran an overfitting analysis. They measured performance on three types of test examples: near-duplicates of training examples with minor variations, novel combinations of patterns seen in training, and completely novel scenarios requiring generalizing beyond training patterns. Performance was 91 percent on near-duplicates, 84 percent on novel combinations, and 72 percent on novel scenarios. The model was partially memorizing training examples rather than fully learning the underlying patterns.

They built a memorization detection metric that measured how much model performance depended on similarity to training examples. For each test case, they computed semantic similarity to the nearest training example and correlated similarity with correctness. High correlation indicates memorization. Low correlation indicates genuine learning.

The correlation was 0.68, strongly suggesting memorization. When test examples were highly similar to training examples (similarity above 0.8), accuracy was 89 percent. When similarity dropped below 0.5, accuracy fell to 71 percent. The model's apparent strength was partly an artifact of test examples resembling training data.

They also measured generation diversity. Fine-tuned models that memorize produce less diverse outputs because they are retrieving variations of memorized patterns. They sampled 5 completions for each test input and measured diversity using distinct n-gram ratios. The fine-tuned model's diversity score was 0.43 versus 0.67 for the base model, indicating substantially less output variation and suggesting memorization.

Addressing overfitting required changes to fine-tuning methodology: increasing dropout, using weight decay regularization, reducing training steps, and augmenting training data with more diverse examples. After adjustments, memorization correlation dropped to 0.41 and diversity score improved to 0.58, while task performance remained at 85 percent. They achieved similar accuracy with more genuine learning and less memorization.

## Comparing Fine-Tuned Versus Prompted Versus RAG Approaches

Fine-tuning is not the only way to specialize model behavior. Prompting and retrieval-augmented generation can achieve similar goals with different trade-offs. **Approach comparison metrics** help you decide which technique to use.

A technical documentation company in mid-2025 wanted to improve how their AI assistant answered questions about their API. They evaluated three approaches: base model with carefully engineered prompts including examples and instructions, fine-tuned model trained on 5,000 historical question-answer pairs, and RAG system that retrieved relevant documentation and examples for each query.

They measured multiple dimensions of quality. Raw accuracy: prompted base model scored 79 percent, fine-tuned model scored 86 percent, RAG system scored 83 percent. The fine-tuned approach won on accuracy. But accuracy was not the only relevant metric.

They measured answer staleness. When API documentation changed, the prompted and RAG approaches immediately reflected updates because they referenced current documentation. The fine-tuned model continued providing outdated information learned during training until it was retrained. Staleness score (percentage of answers reflecting latest documentation): prompted scored 98 percent, RAG scored 97 percent, fine-tuned scored 71 percent.

They measured maintenance cost. Updating prompts took approximately 2 hours of engineering time. Updating RAG retrieval required indexing new documentation, about 4 hours. Fine-tuning required collecting new examples, retraining, and validation, approximately 40 hours. Maintenance cost per update: prompted $200, RAG $400, fine-tuned $4,000.

They measured latency. Prompted queries took an average of 1.2 seconds. RAG queries took 1.8 seconds including retrieval time. Fine-tuned queries took 1.1 seconds. Fine-tuning had a slight latency advantage but not enough to offset other trade-offs.

They measured generalization to new API endpoints. When the company added new API features not seen during training, the prompted and RAG approaches handled questions about new features because they accessed current documentation. The fine-tuned model struggled with new features, providing generic or incorrect information. Accuracy on questions about new features released after training: prompted scored 76 percent, RAG scored 81 percent, fine-tuned scored 58 percent.

The comprehensive comparison revealed that fine-tuning achieved the highest accuracy on the specific distribution it was trained on but performed worse on almost every other dimension: staleness, maintenance cost, and generalization to new features. The team chose the RAG approach, accepting slightly lower peak accuracy in exchange for better maintainability and handling of documentation updates.

This analysis pattern applies broadly: fine-tuning is not automatically superior to prompting or RAG. The right approach depends on your specific requirements around accuracy, maintenance, staleness, cost, and generalization.

## Measuring Forgetting: What Training Examples Are No Longer Handled Well

As you fine-tune on new data, the model can forget patterns learned earlier in training. **Forgetting metrics** measure what the model could handle before fine-tuning but can no longer handle after.

A customer service company in late 2025 had an iterative fine-tuning process. They started with a base model, fine-tuned it on 3,000 January conversations, then continued fine-tuning on 3,000 February conversations, then March, and so on. Each month they observed good performance on recent conversations but received reports that the model handled older conversation types less well.

They built a forgetting detection benchmark. After each monthly fine-tuning iteration, they evaluated performance on conversations from all previous months. After January fine-tuning, January accuracy was 88 percent. After February fine-tuning, February accuracy was 89 percent but January had dropped to 83 percent. After March, March was 90 percent, February was 85 percent, and January was 79 percent. Each fine-tuning iteration degraded performance on earlier data.

The pattern was **catastrophic forgetting**, where neural networks forget previously learned patterns when trained on new data. The model's limited capacity was being reallocated from old patterns to new patterns. This created a decay curve where the oldest training data was forgotten fastest.

They measured forgetting by tracking performance on fixed benchmark sets from each month over time. They calculated forgetting rate as the percentage point decline in accuracy per subsequent fine-tuning iteration. January data showed 2.5 percentage point decline per month. February showed 2.2 points per month. More recent data forgot slower, but all historical data degraded over time.

Mitigating forgetting required changes to their fine-tuning approach. They added experience replay, where each training batch included a mix of new data and samples from previous months. This reduced forgetting rate from 2.5 points per month to 0.8 points, though it slowed improvement on new data. They also considered whether continuous fine-tuning was the right approach at all, or whether they should periodically retrain from scratch on the full cumulative dataset.

## Domain Transfer: Fine-Tuning for Multiple Related Domains

Some applications require handling multiple specialized domains. **Domain transfer metrics** measure how well a model fine-tuned for one domain performs on related domains, and whether multi-domain fine-tuning maintains quality across domains.

A translation service in early 2026 needed specialized models for legal, medical, and technical translation. They evaluated three approaches: separate models fine-tuned on each domain, a single model fine-tuned on all three domains together, and a base model with domain-specific prompting.

Single-domain fine-tuning achieved highest accuracy on each domain: legal model scored 89 percent BLEU on legal text, medical model scored 87 percent on medical text, technical model scored 86 percent on technical text. But single-domain models performed poorly on other domains: the legal model scored only 76 percent on medical text and 74 percent on technical text.

Multi-domain fine-tuning achieved lower peak performance but better cross-domain transfer: 85 percent on legal, 83 percent on medical, 84 percent on technical. The multi-domain model was less specialized but more versatile. It also handled mixed-domain documents better: when a legal contract contained medical or technical terminology, the multi-domain model maintained coherence while the legal-only model produced poor translations of non-legal terms.

The base model with domain-specific prompting achieved 81 percent on legal, 79 percent on medical, and 80 percent on technical, lower than either fine-tuning approach but without requiring separate models or training. Cost analysis revealed that maintaining three specialized models plus a multi-domain model for mixed content cost approximately $18,000 per month in training and serving infrastructure. The prompted approach cost $3,000 per month in serving only.

Domain transfer metrics revealed the trade-off space. If you need maximum quality on a single domain and rarely handle other domains, single-domain fine-tuning is optimal. If you need good quality across multiple domains and handle mixed-domain content, multi-domain fine-tuning is better. If domains change frequently or you need cost efficiency, prompting may be best despite lower peak quality.

## Fine-Tuning Stability: How Robust Is Quality Across Training Runs

Fine-tuning involves randomness in data sampling, weight initialization, and optimization. **Stability metrics** measure how much quality varies across different training runs with the same data.

A content moderation company in mid-2025 fine-tuned a model to detect policy violations. They ran the same fine-tuning process three times with different random seeds and got final validation accuracies of 87 percent, 89 percent, and 84 percent. The 5 percentage point range troubled them. Which run represented the true quality? Should they always take the best of multiple runs? How many runs were needed to reliably find a good result?

They conducted a stability analysis, running 20 independent fine-tuning iterations with the same data and hyperparameters but different random seeds. Final accuracy ranged from 82 percent to 91 percent with mean 86.4 percent and standard deviation 2.3 percentage points. Fine-tuning quality was highly variable.

They measured stability across multiple quality dimensions. Accuracy had standard deviation of 2.3 points. Precision had 2.7 points. Recall had 3.1 points. F1 score had 2.4 points. Some metrics were more stable than others. They also found that accuracy on specific content categories varied more than overall accuracy. Violence detection stability was 1.8 points standard deviation, but hate speech detection was 4.2 points. The model was learning hate speech detection less reliably than violence detection.

Instability had practical implications. If they deployed the model after a single training run, they might get 82 percent accuracy or 91 percent accuracy depending on luck. If they ran multiple trainings and selected the best, they would usually get 88 to 91 percent, but this required 3x to 5x the training cost. If they needed guaranteed minimum quality, they had to budget for the worst-case outcome around 82 percent, not the mean of 86 percent.

They used stability metrics to guide fine-tuning improvements. They increased training data from 8,000 to 15,000 examples, reducing standard deviation from 2.3 to 1.4 points. They tuned learning rate and batch size, further reducing variation to 1.1 points. They added early stopping based on validation loss rather than fixed steps, creating more consistent convergence. These changes made fine-tuning more reliable without improving average quality much, but reliability was valuable for production systems where consistency mattered.

## Behavioral Consistency: Preserving Model Personality and Style

Fine-tuning can change not just what the model knows but how it communicates. **Behavioral consistency metrics** measure whether fine-tuning preserves desired model personality, tone, and interaction style.

A chatbot company in late 2025 fine-tuned Claude 3.5 Sonnet to improve its knowledge of their product. The base Claude had a helpful, friendly, slightly formal personality that users liked. After fine-tuning on 6,000 product-specific conversations, the model's product knowledge improved dramatically but users reported that the chatbot felt different, less personable, more robotic.

The team measured behavioral consistency using a personality assessment framework. They scored conversations on dimensions including friendliness, formality, verbosity, empathy, humor, and directness. The base Claude scored 8.2 out of 10 on friendliness, 6.1 on formality, 5.8 on verbosity, 7.9 on empathy, 4.2 on humor, and 6.7 on directness. The fine-tuned model scored 7.1 on friendliness, 7.8 on formality, 4.9 on verbosity, 6.8 on empathy, 2.1 on humor, and 7.4 on directness.

Fine-tuning had shifted the model's personality toward more formal, less friendly, less humorous communication. This happened because training conversations were formal product support exchanges, and the model learned that communication style along with product knowledge. The personality shift degraded user experience despite improved factual quality.

Preserving behavioral consistency during fine-tuning requires either diversifying training data to include desired personality traits or using techniques like persona prompting that separate content knowledge from interaction style. The chatbot company rebuilt their training set to include not just product information but also examples demonstrating their desired personality traits. They also used a two-stage approach: retrieve product information using the fine-tuned model, then pass it to a prompted base model for final response generation with personality preserved.

## The Decision Framework: When to Fine-Tune and When to Avoid It

Fine-tuning is a powerful tool but not always the right tool. The metrics above create a framework for deciding when fine-tuning is worth it.

Fine-tune when: you have large amounts of high-quality labeled data in a consistent distribution, the target task is narrow and well-defined, you need maximum possible accuracy on that specific task, task distribution changes slowly, you have infrastructure to manage model versioning and deployment, and the alignment tax does not harm critical adjacent use cases.

Avoid fine-tuning when: you have limited training data, the task distribution is broad or rapidly changing, prompting or RAG achieve acceptable quality, the task requires up-to-date information, you need to support multiple related tasks, or maintenance costs are prohibitive.

Use the metrics to make this decision empirically. Measure specialization depth and compare it to what prompting or RAG achieve. Measure alignment tax and evaluate whether the capability loss is acceptable. Measure generalization breadth and assess whether the model will handle real-world variation. Measure overfitting and ensure you are learning patterns, not memorizing examples. Compare approaches across all relevant dimensions: accuracy, staleness, cost, latency, maintenance, and generalization.

Fine-tuning changes models in complex ways. The only way to understand those changes is to measure them comprehensively. The next challenge is measuring quality when your AI system is not consuming training data but generating it.
