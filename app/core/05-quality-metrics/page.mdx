# Quality Dimensions & Metrics

You can't improve what you can't measure — but in AI, you can't measure what you haven't defined. And most teams never define quality rigorously enough to measure it at all.

Quality in AI systems is not a single number. It is not accuracy. It is not a thumbs-up rate. It is not "the model seems good." Quality is a multi-dimensional construct that spans correctness, groundedness, safety, robustness, latency, cost, tone, fairness, and a dozen other axes that shift depending on your product, your users, your risk tier, and your regulatory environment. Treating quality as one thing — or worse, as a feeling — is how teams ship systems that look great in demos and fall apart in production.

This section teaches you how to think about quality as a measurable, decomposable, actionable system. How to identify the dimensions that matter for your product. How to design metrics that track those dimensions without gaming or drift. How to set thresholds that mean something. How to connect technical metrics to business outcomes. How to handle the special requirements of safety, compliance, and industry-specific regulation. And how to maintain your metric system as your product, your users, and the AI landscape evolve.

If Section 2 taught you how to frame the problem, Section 3 taught you how to evaluate it, and Section 4 taught you how to build ground truth — this section teaches you how to define what "good" actually means, in numbers, for every dimension that matters.

## Why This Section Matters

Without rigorous quality metrics, every conversation about your AI system devolves into opinion. Product says it feels better. Engineering says the benchmarks improved. Leadership asks if it's ready to ship and nobody can answer with data. Metrics are the shared language that lets everyone — engineers, product managers, executives, compliance officers, domain experts — look at the same numbers and make the same decisions.

With the right metrics in place, you know when to ship and when to hold. You know which dimensions are improving and which are regressing. You know whether a model change helped overall quality or just traded one failure mode for another. You can prove compliance, justify cost, defend decisions, and iterate with confidence instead of hope.

This is the infrastructure that turns AI quality from a subjective debate into an engineering discipline.

*Let's start with why a single quality score is the most dangerous number in AI.*
