# Chapter 10 — Cost Governance, Resilience, and the Operating Model

Optimization without governance is a one-time project. Governance without optimization is bureaucracy. This final chapter covers the operating model that keeps cost engineering alive in your organization over time: budgets and guardrails that prevent runaway spend, graceful degradation that automatically reduces cost under pressure, stress testing and worst-case modeling that prepare you for scenarios before they hit production, forecasting and capacity planning, vendor strategy and negotiation leverage, chargeback models that allocate costs to the business units that generate them, and the maturity model that takes your cost engineering practice from reactive firefighting to predictive control.

*The goal is not to make AI cheap. The goal is to make AI costs visible, predictable, and controlled, so that every dollar you spend is a dollar you chose to spend.*
