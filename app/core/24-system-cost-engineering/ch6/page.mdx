# Chapter 6 — Tool, API, and Retrieval Cost Surfaces

Model inference is the cost line teams watch. Tools, APIs, and retrieval are the cost lines that blindside them. In a production AI system, every external API call, every embedding generation, every vector search, every reranking pass, and every retry has a price, and these costs compound in ways that are invisible until someone builds the attribution dashboard. This chapter maps the hidden cost surfaces that sit between your model and your user, from external API economics to vector database pricing to the compounding cost of retries against unreliable dependencies.

*Your model might be the most expensive component. But the tools around it are the ones nobody is tracking.*
