# Chapter 1 — The Cost Engineering Discipline

Most AI teams discover cost engineering the hard way: an invoice arrives that is three times larger than projected, a customer signs a contract that is unprofitable from day one, or a promising product scales into negative margins that grow worse with every new user. Cost engineering exists to make these surprises impossible. This chapter establishes the discipline itself, from the Total Cost Per Request framework that gives you a single equation for every dollar in your system, to the six cost surfaces where money actually goes, to the maturity model that separates teams flying blind from teams that forecast spend before it happens.

*The first step to controlling AI costs is admitting you do not know where the money goes.*
