# Chapter 8 — Cost Pathologies, Anti-Patterns, and Economic Abuse

Every AI system in production develops cost pathologies. Some are self-inflicted: the team that routes every query to a frontier model, the conversation system that accumulates unlimited context, the error handler that retries failed requests into a billing spiral. Others are adversarial: the attacker who discovers that your system charges per query and floods it with expensive prompts, the user who exploits free-tier access to run thousands of agent loops. This chapter catalogs the cost failure modes that only experienced teams recognize, names the anti-patterns so your team can spot them, and covers the economic abuse scenarios that turn your cost layer into an attack surface.

*The most expensive bug in your system is not the one that crashes. It is the one that runs successfully, ten thousand times, at the wrong price.*
