# Chapter 2 — Token Economics: The Atomic Unit of AI Cost

Tokens are not an abstraction. They are compute, latency, and money, and every request your system processes is priced in them. This chapter breaks down the mechanics of token pricing, from the input-output price asymmetry that most teams ignore, to the compounding cost of multi-turn conversations, to the hidden expense of reasoning tokens that never appear in the response. If you cannot account for every token in a request, you cannot account for your costs. Token economics is where cost engineering becomes concrete.
