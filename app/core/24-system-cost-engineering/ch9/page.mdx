# Chapter 9 — Cost Observability, Unit Economics, and Margin Engineering

You cannot optimize what you cannot see. This chapter builds the observability layer that makes cost engineering possible: cost attribution architecture that tracks spend by feature, user, and tenant, unit economics calculations from cost per request through cost per outcome, gross margin modeling that connects your engineering costs to your business viability, anomaly detection that catches spend spikes before the invoice arrives, and the per-tenant tracking that reveals which customers cost more than they pay. Cost observability is not a dashboard. It is the nervous system that tells you whether your product is economically sustainable.

*A profitable AI product is not one that makes money. It is one where you can prove, per request, that it makes money.*
