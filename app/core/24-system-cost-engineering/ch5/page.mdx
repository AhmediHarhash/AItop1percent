# Chapter 5 — Caching and Deduplication Economics

Caching is the single highest-ROI cost optimization available to most AI systems. A cache hit costs effectively nothing compared to a fresh model inference call, and in many products, between twenty and sixty percent of requests are duplicates or near-duplicates that can be served from cache. This chapter covers every caching strategy available in 2026: exact-match response caching, semantic caching with embedding similarity, provider-level prompt caching and KV-cache reuse, tool response caching, and embedding deduplication. It also covers the economics that most teams skip: when cache infrastructure costs more than it saves, when staleness risk outweighs the discount, and how to measure cache ROI with a dashboard that proves your investment.
