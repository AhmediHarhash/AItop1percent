# Chapter 3 — Model Inference Cost: Your Largest Line Item

For most AI products in 2026, model inference is between forty and seventy percent of total variable cost. This chapter covers the full inference cost landscape: the pricing tiers from frontier to small, the economics of model routing and cascading, the cost calculus of fine-tuning versus prompting, the batch processing discount most teams leave on the table, and the inflection points where your volume demands a completely different strategy. If you optimize nothing else, optimize inference. It is almost certainly the largest line on your bill.
