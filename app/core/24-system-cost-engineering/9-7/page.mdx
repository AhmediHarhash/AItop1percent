# 9.7 — Per-Tenant Cost Tracking: Knowing Which Customers Cost More Than They Pay

In every B2B AI product, at least one customer is unprofitable. The question is whether you know which one. Most teams don't. They track total AI spend at the company level, divide by total revenue, and assume the margin is distributed roughly evenly across their customer base. It is not. Enterprise customers vary so dramatically in their usage patterns that the most expensive customer to serve might cost twenty or thirty times more per dollar of revenue than the cheapest. Without per-tenant cost visibility, you are flying blind on the metric that determines whether your business model works at the individual contract level where profitability is actually made or lost.

This is not an abstract accounting exercise. When a sales team closes a $200,000 annual contract and the cost to serve that customer is $280,000, every month that customer remains on the platform accelerates your losses. Multiply that by five or ten unprofitable customers and you have a margin problem that no amount of new bookings can solve. **Per-tenant cost tracking** is the practice of attributing every AI cost event to the specific customer that triggered it, then comparing that cost to the revenue that customer generates. It transforms cost management from a company-level average into a customer-level operating discipline.

## Why Per-Tenant Costs Vary So Dramatically

The assumption that customers cost roughly the same to serve comes from traditional SaaS, where the marginal cost of serving an additional user is close to zero. A SaaS product running on standard compute infrastructure sees virtually no cost difference between a customer who logs in once a week and a customer who logs in fifty times a day. The database queries are cheap. The API calls are cheap. The compute is cheap. Per-user variable cost rounds to zero, and the 80% gross margins that traditional SaaS companies enjoy come from this near-zero marginal cost structure.

AI products shatter this assumption. Every request carries real variable cost. A model inference call that processes 3,000 input tokens and generates 800 output tokens on Claude Sonnet 4.5 costs roughly $0.021. That sounds small until you multiply it by a customer making 50,000 requests per day — $1,050 per day, $31,500 per month, $378,000 per year in model inference costs alone for a single customer. Meanwhile, another customer on the same contract tier makes 2,000 requests per day at $42 per day, $1,260 per month, $15,120 per year. Same product. Same pricing tier. A 25-to-1 cost ratio.

But volume is only one dimension of variance. Request complexity matters just as much. One customer might use your product for simple classification tasks — short prompts, short responses, fast models. Another customer uses it for complex document analysis — 10,000-token context windows, multi-step reasoning chains, premium model tiers. The second customer's average request might cost $0.15 compared to $0.003 for the first customer. A 50-to-1 per-request cost ratio on top of whatever volume differences exist. When you combine volume variance with complexity variance, the spread between your cheapest and most expensive customers to serve can easily exceed 100-to-1.

Feature usage patterns add another layer. If your product offers multiple capabilities — a chat interface, a document analysis pipeline, an agent-based workflow — different customers gravitate toward different features. The agent workflow that chains six model calls, three tool invocations, and a verification step costs dramatically more per interaction than the single-turn chat interface. Customers who discover and adopt your most powerful features become your most expensive to serve, often without any corresponding increase in what they pay.

## The Implementation: Tagging Every Cost Event

Per-tenant cost tracking starts at the instrumentation layer. Every model inference call, every embedding generation, every vector search, every tool invocation — every event that carries variable cost — must be tagged with the tenant identifier of the customer who triggered it. This sounds simple and it is simple if you build it from the start. It becomes a painful retrofit if you try to add it after your cost instrumentation is already in place.

The tagging must happen at the request level, not the user level, because a single customer might have hundreds of users with different usage patterns. Tag with the tenant ID — the customer organization — so you can aggregate up from individual requests to the tenant level. If your product serves both individual users and enterprise accounts, you need both user-level and tenant-level tags. Individual users are their own tenant. Enterprise accounts are a tenant with many users.

The cost calculation for each tagged event includes the direct model inference cost based on token counts and model pricing, plus any associated costs: embedding generation for RAG retrieval, vector database queries, tool execution costs, retry costs if the initial call failed, and any post-processing inference calls like output validation or summarization. Sum all costs associated with a single user-facing interaction and attribute that total to the tenant. This gives you a true cost-per-interaction that reflects everything the system spent to serve that customer's request.

Store the tagged cost events in a time-series data store — a dedicated table in your data warehouse, a purpose-built cost attribution service, or an event stream that feeds into your analytics pipeline. The storage granularity matters. You need individual event data for debugging and drill-down, hourly aggregates for operational monitoring, daily aggregates for trend analysis, and monthly aggregates for business review. Many teams make the mistake of storing only monthly aggregates and lose the ability to understand what drives cost changes within a month.

## The First Report: What Teams Discover

The first time a team generates a per-tenant cost report and compares it to per-tenant revenue, the reaction is almost always the same: shock. The data reveals patterns that were invisible in aggregate.

The most common discovery is that a small number of customers account for a disproportionate share of total cost. Industry experience consistently shows that 10% to 20% of customers in a B2B AI product generate 50% to 70% of total variable cost. This is more extreme than the typical revenue concentration because cost variance across customers is wider than revenue variance. Your top revenue customers pay perhaps 5x to 10x your smallest customers. Your top cost customers might cost 50x to 100x your smallest. The mismatch between these two distributions is where unprofitable customers hide.

The second common discovery is that your most recently acquired enterprise customers are often the most expensive to serve. This happens because enterprise sales teams negotiate discounts on list price while making commitments about feature access and usage that increase cost. A customer who negotiated a 30% discount on your standard enterprise tier but uses your premium model tier for 80% of their requests is structurally unprofitable from day one. Without per-tenant cost data, this is invisible. The sales team celebrates the deal. Finance books the revenue. Nobody knows the margin is negative until the cost data surfaces it.

The third discovery — and the one that changes how the company thinks about pricing — is that unprofitable customers are rarely unprofitable by a small amount. When a customer is underwater, they are typically far underwater. A customer paying $15,000 per month while costing $38,000 per month to serve is not a rounding error. That is a $276,000 annual loss on a single account. Teams that find one customer like this usually find five or ten more, and the aggregate impact on gross margin can be devastating. An AI-first company with a stated 55% gross margin might discover that the margin is 70% on 80% of customers and negative 20% on the remaining 20%. The averages hide the problem.

## The Response Playbook: What to Do With Unprofitable Customers

Finding unprofitable customers is only valuable if you act on the information. The response depends on the severity and the customer's strategic value.

**Optimize the expensive use cases first.** Before touching pricing or contract terms, look at what the customer is doing that costs so much. Are they routing simple requests through your premium model tier when a cheaper model would deliver equivalent quality? Are they making redundant API calls because of a poorly integrated workflow? Are they generating enormous context windows because they send entire documents when a summary would suffice? In many cases, 30% to 50% of a customer's excess cost can be eliminated through routing optimization, caching, and workflow improvements that the customer never notices. This is the best outcome — the customer stays happy, the cost drops, and you don't need a difficult pricing conversation.

**Renegotiate pricing for structurally misaligned accounts.** When the cost is high because the customer genuinely uses the product intensively — they need the premium model, they process high volumes, they rely on expensive features — the pricing is simply wrong. The contract doesn't reflect the cost of serving the customer. This requires a conversation with the account team and ultimately with the customer. The approach that works is transparency: show the customer their usage data, explain the cost drivers, and propose a pricing adjustment that reflects their actual consumption. Most enterprise customers understand that a product they depend on needs sustainable economics. The ones who resist are telling you something about the long-term viability of the relationship.

**Implement usage-based pricing tiers.** The structural fix for per-tenant cost variance is pricing that scales with usage. A flat subscription means high-usage customers subsidize low-usage customers, and the subsidy grows as the expensive customers increase their usage. Usage-based pricing — charging per request, per token, per workflow execution, or per outcome — aligns cost and revenue at the tenant level automatically. By 2026, industry surveys show that over 90% of AI software companies use some form of hybrid pricing that combines a base subscription with usage-based components. The companies that still rely on pure flat-rate subscriptions for AI products are the ones most likely to discover catastrophic per-tenant margin problems.

**Accept strategic losses deliberately.** Some customers are unprofitable and should remain so — but only if you choose this deliberately. A marquee logo that anchors your sales pipeline is worth a loss. A customer whose feedback is shaping your product roadmap is worth a loss. A customer in a new vertical you're trying to enter is worth a loss. The key word is "deliberately." An unprofitable customer that you consciously choose to subsidize is a business strategy. An unprofitable customer you didn't know was unprofitable is a business failure. Per-tenant cost tracking ensures that every loss is a choice, not a surprise.

## The Monthly Review Cadence

Per-tenant cost data is most valuable when it drives regular action. The operating cadence that works for most B2B AI products is a monthly per-tenant profitability review that involves engineering, finance, and account management.

The review starts with a ranked list of customers sorted by profitability — revenue minus variable cost — from most profitable to least profitable. Engineering provides the cost data. Finance provides the revenue data. The combined view shows the margin for every customer. The first item on the agenda is always the bottom of the list: which customers are unprofitable, why, and what is the plan for each one.

For each unprofitable customer, the team classifies the root cause. Is it a pricing problem — the customer pays too little for what they use? Is it an optimization problem — the customer's usage pattern is inefficient and could be improved? Is it a product problem — a feature the customer depends on is structurally expensive and needs architectural work? Each root cause leads to a different action: pricing renegotiation, usage optimization, or a product engineering initiative to reduce cost for that feature.

The review also tracks trends. A customer who was profitable last month but is trending toward unprofitability is an early warning. Cost growth that outpaces revenue growth for a specific customer signals that either their usage is expanding faster than their contract contemplates, or a product change increased the cost to serve them. Catching these trends early — when the margin is thin but still positive — is much easier than catching them after the customer is deeply unprofitable and a contract renegotiation feels adversarial.

Set threshold alerts that trigger between reviews. If a customer's estimated monthly cost exceeds 80% of their monthly revenue, the system should alert the account team and the cost engineering team. This gives you time to investigate before the customer crosses into unprofitable territory. The alert threshold should be configurable per customer because strategic accounts might have different tolerance levels than standard accounts.

## Per-Tenant Tracking for Usage-Based Pricing

Per-tenant cost tracking becomes even more critical when you move to usage-based pricing because the cost data directly informs whether your pricing tiers are set correctly. If you charge $0.05 per request and your average cost per request is $0.02, your gross margin on that unit is 60%. But "average cost per request" hides the distribution. If 70% of requests cost $0.005 and 30% of requests cost $0.055, your simple requests are highly profitable and your complex requests lose money on every unit sold. The pricing works only in aggregate and only if the ratio of simple to complex requests stays stable.

Per-tenant cost data lets you see which customers are predominantly simple-request users — highly profitable on a per-unit basis — and which customers are predominantly complex-request users — marginally profitable or unprofitable on a per-unit basis. This distribution informs pricing design. You might need different pricing for different request types, different tiers that correspond to different usage profiles, or a metered pricing model that charges based on actual resource consumption rather than a flat per-request rate.

The most sophisticated B2B AI platforms in 2026 tag cost events not just by tenant but by feature, model tier, and complexity class. This gives them a three-dimensional view: which customer, using which feature, at which complexity level, generating which cost. With that granularity, pricing teams can design tier structures that are profitable for every usage pattern, not just the average one.

## The Privacy and Data Handling Dimension

Per-tenant cost tracking creates a dataset that is itself sensitive. It reveals your customers' usage patterns, their operational intensity, and indirectly their business volume. In some industries — healthcare, financial services, legal — the usage patterns themselves might constitute business intelligence that customers expect to remain confidential. Your cost attribution data must be stored with the same access controls as your customer data. Limit access to the teams that need it: cost engineering, finance, and account management. Do not expose per-tenant cost data in dashboards accessible to the broader engineering team unless there is a specific need.

The data retention policy for per-tenant cost data should align with your business review cycles. Keep granular per-event data for 90 days to support debugging and investigation. Keep daily aggregates for 12 months to support trend analysis. Keep monthly aggregates indefinitely to support long-term profitability analysis and contract renewal preparation. Purge the granular data on schedule — it is voluminous and its value diminishes rapidly after the first few weeks.

## From Cost Visibility to Business Strategy

Per-tenant cost tracking is not just a finance tool. It is a strategic lens that changes how you think about customers, pricing, product development, and growth. When you know which customers are profitable and which are not, you can direct sales efforts toward the customer profiles that generate healthy margins. You can design product features with a clear understanding of their cost implications per customer segment. You can enter pricing negotiations with data instead of guesswork. You can forecast the margin impact of landing a new enterprise customer based on their expected usage profile.

The companies that build per-tenant cost tracking early — before they have a margin crisis — treat it as a competitive advantage. They price more accurately, they close deals with better terms, they identify and fix unprofitable accounts before the losses accumulate, and they make product investment decisions grounded in actual economics rather than assumptions. The companies that wait until a margin crisis forces them to investigate discover the hard way that building cost attribution retroactively is expensive, disruptive, and arrives too late to prevent the losses that motivated it.

Per-tenant cost visibility is the foundation. But knowing which customers are unprofitable today tells you nothing about whether your overall margin is improving or deteriorating as you grow. The next subchapter examines the margin erosion problem — the counterintuitive pattern where AI product margins decrease as the product scales, the opposite of everything traditional SaaS taught us to expect.
