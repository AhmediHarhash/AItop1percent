# Section 24 — System Cost Engineering

Every token has a price. Every API call has a margin. Every architectural decision you make either protects your unit economics or quietly destroys them. In 2026, with frontier model pricing still measured in dollars per million tokens, with agent systems making unpredictable numbers of tool calls per request, and with enterprise customers demanding both quality and cost transparency in the same contract, cost engineering is no longer something you do after launch. It is an engineering discipline as fundamental as reliability or security, and the teams that treat it as an afterthought are the teams that discover their product is unprofitable at scale.

This section covers the complete cost engineering landscape for AI systems. The Total Cost Per Request framework that accounts for every dollar flowing through your system. Token economics and the price asymmetry between input and output. Model inference cost optimization from routing to cascading to distillation. Prompt and context optimization that cuts token spend without cutting quality. Caching and deduplication economics. The hidden cost surfaces in tools, APIs, and retrieval pipelines. Infrastructure and compute cost engineering for both API-based and self-hosted deployments. Cost pathologies and economic abuse patterns that catch experienced teams off guard. Unit economics, margin engineering, and cost observability. And the governance model that keeps costs controlled as the organization scales.

Ten chapters. Ninety-eight subchapters. Everything you need to measure, optimize, and govern the cost of running AI in production.

*The cheapest AI system is the one that never ships. The second cheapest is the one where someone actually tracked the cost per request before signing the enterprise contract.*
