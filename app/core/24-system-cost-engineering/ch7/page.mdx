# Chapter 7 — Infrastructure and Compute Cost Engineering

At some scale, the question stops being which API to call and starts being whether to run your own hardware. This chapter covers the infrastructure cost decisions that define the economics of your AI system: the total cost of ownership calculation for API-based versus self-hosted inference, GPU economics in 2026 across on-demand, reserved, and spot markets, autoscaling that avoids paying for idle capacity, serverless GPU platforms, quantization as a cost lever, and the networking and egress costs that nobody budgets for. Whether you run on someone else's GPUs or your own, this chapter gives you the math to know what you are paying and whether it is worth it.

*The GPU you are paying for right now is probably sitting idle thirty percent of the time. That is not an infrastructure problem. That is a cost engineering problem.*
