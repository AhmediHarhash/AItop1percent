# Chapter 9 — Prompt, Configuration, and Vendor Regression

Your prompts are executable code. Your configurations are production dependencies. Your third-party providers are services you do not control. Each one can silently break your system without warning. This chapter covers how to treat prompts as versioned artifacts, detect configuration drift, and verify that vendor behavior remains stable across changes you never made.
