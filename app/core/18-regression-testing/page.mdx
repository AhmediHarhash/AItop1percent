# Regression Testing and Release Gates

You change a prompt. Accuracy improves by three points. You ship it. Two weeks later, customer complaints spike. The model started refusing requests it used to handle. Your metrics said the change was safe. Your metrics lied.

This is the regression problem in AI systems. A change improves one dimension and silently breaks another. The traditional software playbook does not work here. Unit tests cannot capture emergent behavior. Integration tests cannot predict how a model will fail on inputs you have not seen. The model itself is the variable. Every change to prompts, configuration, data, or the model creates risk that standard testing cannot detect.

Regression testing for AI is not about preventing bugs. It is about proving that improvements are real and that capabilities you depend on have not vanished. It is the discipline of treating every change as guilty until proven innocent. It is the infrastructure that stops bad deploys before they reach production. It is the reason some teams ship confidently while others guess and hope.

This section teaches the complete operating model: how to design golden sets that anchor detection, how to structure test suites with statistical rigor, how to integrate evaluation into CI/CD pipelines, how to set gates that block unsafe changes, how to detect drift in data and retrieval systems, how to test safety and compliance without false confidence, and how to connect regression testing to business KPIs. By the end, you will know how to build the release infrastructure that makes every deploy defensible.
