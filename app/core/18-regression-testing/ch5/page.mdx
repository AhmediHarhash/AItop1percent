# Chapter 5 — CI/CD Integration for AI Systems

Traditional continuous integration assumes tests are fast, cheap, and deterministic. AI systems break all three assumptions. Evals cost money to run, take minutes to hours to complete, and produce different results on identical inputs. The CI/CD patterns that work for deterministic software fail spectacularly when the system under test is probabilistic.

*Automation is not optional. When humans are responsible for remembering to run evals before merge, evals get skipped. When the pipeline enforces quality gates, regressions get caught. The only question is whether you build the pipeline before or after a bad deploy reaches production.*
