# Chapter 7 — Safety, Policy, and Compliance Regression

Safety regressions are the silent killers of AI systems. A performance regression triggers alerts, a latency spike gets flagged immediately, but a safety failure sits dormant until a user reports it — or worse, until it makes headlines. By the time you know your model started producing harmful content, thousands of users may have already seen it. This chapter covers how to detect, prevent, and respond to regressions in safety, policy enforcement, and compliance controls before they cause damage.

*Safety gates are non-negotiable. The model that ships is the model that gets used. You cannot patch safety failures the way you patch code.*
