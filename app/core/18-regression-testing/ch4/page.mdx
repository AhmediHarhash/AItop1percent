# Chapter 4 — Data, Retrieval, and Knowledge Regression

Your model did not change. Your prompts did not change. Your evaluation suite passed. And yet your system started returning worse answers. This is the data regression — the silent killer that lives underneath every RAG system, every knowledge base, every retrieval pipeline. While teams obsess over model performance and prompt quality, the data layer quietly degrades, and no one notices until users complain.

Data regressions are invisible to model-focused testing. They do not trigger errors. They do not fail deployments. They just make your system slightly worse, conversation by conversation, until the cumulative damage becomes undeniable. This chapter teaches you how to detect, measure, and prevent data layer regressions before they reach production.

*When the model stays the same but the answers get worse, you are not debugging a model problem. You are debugging a data problem. And most teams have no tests for that.*
