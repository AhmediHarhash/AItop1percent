# Chapter 8 — Deployment Gating and Drift Detection

Regression tests catch problems before deployment. Deployment gates catch problems during deployment. Drift detection catches problems after deployment. Together they form the defense system that keeps production quality from degrading. The test suite tells you if a change is safe. The gate tells you if the rollout is safe. The drift detector tells you if the deployed system is still safe. All three are necessary. None is sufficient alone.

*Production is where quality is proven, not assumed. The gate is where you decide if the proof is sufficient.*
