# Chapter 1 — Foundations of AI Regression Testing

Traditional regression testing assumes deterministic systems. Change the code, run the tests, verify the outputs match. AI systems break every assumption in that sentence. The model is probabilistic. The outputs vary. What counts as correct depends on context you cannot fully enumerate. And the thing you are testing—the model's behavior—emerges from training data, not from code you wrote.

This chapter establishes why AI regression testing requires a fundamentally different approach. You will learn what regressions look like in LLM systems, why they are harder to detect than in traditional software, how to define baselines when behavior is not deterministic, and how to build the foundational infrastructure that makes regression detection possible. The teams that master these foundations ship faster and break less. The teams that skip them deploy changes they cannot defend.
