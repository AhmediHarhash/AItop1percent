# Chapter 10 — Business KPIs, Observability, and Operational Maturity

Regression testing reaches its full value only when it connects to business outcomes. A test suite that catches every model degradation but misses the metric that matters to users is expensive theater. The final discipline is translating model quality into business quality, building observability that spans from test failures to revenue impact, and creating organizational maturity where quality gates are respected because everyone understands what breaks when they're bypassed.
