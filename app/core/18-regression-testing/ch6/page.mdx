# Chapter 6 — Quality Gates, Thresholds, and Cost Controls

A quality gate is not a dashboard. It is not a report. It is not a warning. A quality gate is a blocker that stops a deployment until evidence proves the new version is safe to release. Most teams collect metrics. Mature teams enforce thresholds. The difference between the two is the difference between watching a system degrade and preventing degradation from reaching production.
