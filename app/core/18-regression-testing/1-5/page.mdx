# 1.5 — The Cost of Undetected Regressions

The support tickets started arriving on a Tuesday. Not a flood — just a steady trickle. Users reporting that the legal document assistant was "acting strange." By Thursday, the product team had logged 89 complaints. By the following Monday, a major client threatened to cancel their six-figure annual contract. The issue was not a crash. It was not an error message. The model was running perfectly. It was also generating case law citations that did not exist.

The team investigated. They discovered that the new model, deployed two weeks earlier, had passed all accuracy tests with improved metrics. Precision up three percentage points. Recall up two. The test suite was green. The model was hallucinating at triple the baseline rate, inventing court cases and statute numbers that sounded plausible but were completely fabricated. The accuracy eval never checked for hallucinations because it only measured whether the model correctly extracted information from real documents. It never checked whether the model added false information.

The financial damage: $340,000 in annual recurring revenue at risk from one threatened cancellation, $48,000 in emergency engineering costs to roll back and fix the issue, two weeks of product development time lost, and immeasurable brand damage. The root cause was not the model. It was the eval. The team tested for accuracy regression and ignored nine other regression types. They detected the problem the same way most teams detect regressions — their users told them.

## The Pattern of Silent Degradation

Undetected regressions do not announce themselves. They do not crash the application. They do not trigger alerts. They do not fail your test suite. They quietly degrade the user experience while your monitoring dashboards report normal operation. This is why they are more dangerous than outages.

An outage is loud. It breaks things visibly. It triggers alerts. It mobilizes the team. It gets fixed within hours. A regression is silent. It makes things slightly worse in ways that are hard to measure. It does not trigger alerts because your alerts were not designed to detect quality drift. It gets noticed weeks or months later when a user complains, when a business metric declines, or when someone manually reviews outputs and realizes something changed.

The median time to detection for silent regressions is three to seven weeks. The fast cases get caught in one week when a power user notices immediately and reports loudly. The slow cases take three months when enough users have quietly abandoned the feature that someone investigates why engagement dropped. During that window, the regression is live. It is affecting users. It is damaging trust. It is costing you revenue, satisfaction, and brand equity. And your regression test suite, which ran and passed before deploy, caught nothing.

The reason silent degradation is so dangerous is compound damage. An outage affects users during the outage window and then stops. A regression affects users continuously until detection and then continues affecting users until fix and then continues affecting users until re-deploy. If detection takes four weeks and fix takes two weeks, you have six weeks of user impact. If you deploy weekly, that is six deploy cycles where users experienced degraded quality. The cost accumulates.

The second reason is trust erosion. Users forgive outages if you communicate well and fix fast. Users do not forgive quality degradation because they do not know whether you are aware of it. When an AI product quietly gets worse, users assume one of three things: you do not care, you do not notice, or you cannot fix it. All three assumptions damage trust. The longer the regression runs undetected, the more users conclude that your quality bar is lower than they thought.

## Revenue Erosion from Quality Drift

Quality drift has a direct revenue impact that most teams do not model until after the damage occurs. The impact pattern depends on your business model, but the mechanism is universal: users who experience degraded quality reduce their usage, and reduced usage eventually reduces revenue.

For B2C products with engagement-based monetization, quality drift reduces session frequency and session duration. A search product that becomes less accurate gets used less often. A writing assistant that becomes less helpful gets invoked less frequently. A recommendation system that becomes less relevant gets ignored more often. Engagement drops before revenue drops, but engagement is a leading indicator. If daily active users decline by eight percent over six weeks and you do not know why, you may have a silent regression that your dashboards are not detecting.

For B2B products with subscription revenue, quality drift increases churn. Enterprise customers tolerate minor issues if you communicate and fix quickly. They do not tolerate extended quality degradation. A customer support automation product that used to resolve 68 percent of tickets autonomously and now resolves 54 percent has lost its core value proposition. When renewal comes, the customer will renegotiate downward or cancel. The revenue impact is not immediate — it shows up months later when the contract expires. But the regression caused it.

For usage-based pricing models, quality drift creates a particularly insidious problem. If the regression increases cost per query — longer outputs, more tool calls, slower inference requiring more compute — your users are paying more for worse quality. They will notice. They will complain. They will demand pricing adjustments or credits. You will either lose margin by granting credits or lose customers by refusing them. Either outcome is expensive.

The legal industry case study that opened this section quantifies this clearly. One threatened contract cancellation was worth $340,000 in ARR. The client was not bluffing — they had already paused rollout and were evaluating competitors. The regression had been live for two weeks. If it had gone undetected for another four weeks, the client would have formally canceled. The revenue impact of an undetected hallucination regression was a six-figure loss from a single customer. The company had 40 enterprise customers. If even one more had noticed and reacted similarly, the total revenue at risk would have exceeded $600,000.

## Compliance Exposure and Legal Risk

Some regressions create legal liability. A model that starts violating content policy, disclosure requirements, or regulatory obligations exposes the company to fines, lawsuits, and regulatory action. This risk is highest in regulated industries — healthcare, finance, legal services — but exists anywhere your AI product makes claims or provides advice.

A healthcare chatbot that stops including required medical disclaimers has a policy compliance regression. If a user relies on medical information without understanding it is not a substitute for professional advice, and harm results, the company faces liability. A financial advisor bot that starts making investment recommendations without required fiduciary disclosures has a regulatory compliance regression. If users make investment decisions based on that advice, the company faces regulatory action and potential lawsuits.

The financial services industry provides the clearest examples because regulations are explicit and penalties are quantified. FINRA and SEC rules require specific disclosures when providing investment information. A robo-advisor that fails to include required risk disclosures violates securities law. The penalties range from $50,000 to $500,000 per violation depending on severity and intent. An undetected compliance regression that affects 2,000 users before detection creates exposure in the millions of dollars.

The terrifying part is that compliance regressions are nearly invisible without dedicated testing. Your accuracy eval measures whether the model provides correct information. It does not measure whether the model includes legally required disclaimers. Your safety eval measures whether the model refuses unsafe requests. It does not measure whether the model complies with industry-specific regulations. Your policy eval, if you have one, checks whether outputs violate your internal content policy. It may not check regulatory compliance unless you explicitly designed it to.

Most teams discover compliance regressions the same way they discover hallucination regressions: a user reports a problem, a regulator sends a letter, or an internal audit finds violations. By that point, the regression has been live for weeks or months. The exposure has already accumulated. The damage is done. The only question is how much it costs to remediate and whether the company faces formal penalties.

## Cost Creep and Budget Overruns

Some regressions cost money directly by increasing the marginal cost per query. These regressions are invisible during testing because testing uses a fixed eval set. A cost regression that doubles per-query spend is irrelevant when you run 500 test queries. It becomes catastrophic when you process 30 million production queries per month.

A model switch from GPT-5-mini to GPT-5 might improve accuracy by four percentage points. It also increases per-query cost by 8x. If your testing validates the accuracy improvement and ignores the cost increase, you will deploy the change. Three weeks later, your cloud bill arrives and it is $180,000 higher than expected. You have a cost regression that no one detected because no one measured cost during regression testing.

The insidious version is compound cost regressions. You switch models — cost increases 40 percent. You adjust max output tokens to reduce truncation — cost increases another 15 percent. You expand retrieval from top-3 to top-5 to improve context quality — cost increases another 12 percent. Each change is small. Each change is justified. Together they create a 78 percent cost increase that no single regression test detected because each test measured only one change.

The e-commerce company story from the Chapter 1 introduction provides a concrete example. The team deployed three changes over six weeks: a model upgrade, a context expansion, and a retrieval improvement. Each change passed regression tests. Each change improved quality metrics. None of the regression tests measured cost. The cumulative cost increase was 140 percent. The company processed 18 million queries per month. The monthly cost increase was $127,000. Annualized, that is $1.5 million in incremental AI spend that no one budgeted for.

Cost creep also affects teams differently depending on their budget structure. A team with a fixed annual AI budget will hit their cap faster and then have to either request more budget or throttle usage. A team with usage-based budgeting will simply spend more until Finance notices and demands an explanation. Either scenario is politically damaging. The engineer who deployed the regression becomes the person who blew the budget. The conversation with leadership is uncomfortable: "We improved accuracy by three percentage points and it cost an extra $1.5 million per year. No, we did not realize that before we deployed."

## Brand Damage and Trust Collapse

The worst regressions are the ones that make users lose trust in the product. These regressions do not cause obvious failures. They cause subtle quality degradation that makes users question whether the product is as good as it used to be. Once users start questioning quality, trust collapses faster than metrics suggest.

A writing assistant that starts producing slightly lower quality suggestions does not trigger user complaints immediately. Users just stop accepting the suggestions as often. Acceptance rate drops from 64 percent to 51 percent over eight weeks. The team eventually notices the metric decline and investigates. They find a tone regression — the new model writes in a flatter, less natural style. The accuracy is identical. The user experience is worse. Trust eroded silently while the team focused on accuracy metrics.

Brand damage is particularly severe for products where quality is the primary differentiator. If your AI product is marketed as "the most accurate," "the most reliable," or "the most trustworthy," any quality regression directly undermines your brand promise. A competitor can use your regression as ammunition: "They used to be good, but they have slipped. Try us instead." The damage is not just to current users — it is to market perception.

The social proof spiral accelerates brand damage. One user notices quality degradation and posts about it on social media. Other users reply saying they noticed the same thing. The thread gets traction. Suddenly your quality regression is a narrative. Journalists pick it up. "Company X's AI assistant is getting worse, users say." You can fix the technical regression in a week. You cannot fix the brand damage in a week. The narrative persists long after the fix deploys.

The legal document case study shows how fast brand damage can escalate. The first user complaints arrived on Tuesday. By Monday, a major client was threatening cancellation. The client was not just upset about the hallucinations — they were upset that the hallucinations went undetected for two weeks. The implication: the company either does not test thoroughly or does not care about quality. Both implications are brand-damaging. The client's trust was not just in the model — it was in the company's engineering discipline. The regression undermined both.

## Why Silent Degradation is Worse than Outages

Outages are acute. Regressions are chronic. Outages hurt for hours. Regressions hurt for weeks. Outages are obvious. Regressions are subtle. Outages trigger war-room response. Regressions trigger slow investigation after users complain. The chronic nature of regressions makes them more damaging than equivalently severe outages.

An outage that takes down your product for four hours affects every user during those four hours. A regression that degrades quality by 15 percent for six weeks affects every user during those six weeks. The outage causes a single bad experience. The regression causes 1,008 hours of slightly degraded experience. The cumulative impact is larger. The trust damage is deeper. The revenue risk is higher.

The second difference is detectability. Outages are binary — the system works or it does not. Regressions are gradual — the system works slightly worse than before. Binary failures trigger alerts immediately. Gradual degradation requires active measurement to detect. Most teams have excellent outage detection and poor regression detection. They know within seconds when the system is down. They know weeks later when the system is worse.

The third difference is user perception. Users understand outages. Systems go down. It happens. Users expect occasional downtime and forgive it if you communicate well. Users do not understand regressions. The product worked well. Then it worked less well. Why? Users do not know whether the degradation is intentional, accidental, or just them. The ambiguity creates distrust.

The fourth difference is organizational response. Outages trigger immediate executive attention. The CEO knows the system is down. The board knows if the outage is severe. The company mobilizes. Regressions trigger slow escalation. A few users complain. Support investigates. Engineering triages. Product reviews metrics. Eventually someone realizes there is a pattern. By then, the regression has been live for a month. Leadership learns about it in a retrospective, not a war room.

The conclusion is that regression testing is not optional for mature AI systems. It is the primary defense against chronic quality degradation. The next question is how regression testing differs from continuous evaluation, and why you need both to protect production systems.
