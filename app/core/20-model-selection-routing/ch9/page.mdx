# Chapter 9 — Model Lifecycle Management: Surviving Deprecations and Upgrades

Models are not permanent infrastructure. They are depreciating assets with expiration dates. OpenAI has deprecated more model versions in eighteen months than most teams have deployed. Anthropic retires Claude generations on predictable but firm timelines. Google sunsets Gemini snapshots with weeks of notice. If you do not have a lifecycle management discipline, you will discover your production model is end-of-life from a breaking error in your logs, not from a planned migration.

This chapter covers the full model lifecycle. Release, adoption, deprecation, and end-of-life. Version pinning. Deprecation playbooks. Migration testing. Backward compatibility. Upgrade cadence. Shadow deployment. Canary rollouts. Provider outage preparedness. The model registry. Regression detection. A/B testing. Migration runbooks.

*Models come and go. Your product must survive every transition. Lifecycle management is the discipline that makes model churn invisible to your users.*
