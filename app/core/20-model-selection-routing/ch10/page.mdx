# Chapter 10 — Model Governance, Compliance, and Audit

Governance is the difference between an AI system that can survive an audit and one that cannot. In January 2026, with the EU AI Act GPAI obligations in force, with enterprise procurement requiring model risk assessments, and with regulators asking for audit trails that most teams cannot produce, governance is no longer optional paperwork. It is an engineering practice that must be built into your model selection and routing infrastructure from the start.

This chapter covers the full governance layer. Model approval processes. Model cards. EU AI Act GPAI compliance. Audit trails. Compliance by design. Third-party risk assessment. Bias and fairness evaluation. Data processing agreements. Retention and redaction. Policy compatibility testing. Incident response. Regulatory reporting. Cross-border deployment considerations.

*Governance done right is invisible to users and effortless for engineers. Governance done wrong is a compliance emergency discovered the week before an audit.*
