# Chapter 1 — The 2026 Model Landscape: What You Are Choosing From

You cannot choose well from a landscape you do not understand. In January 2026, the model landscape is the most complex it has ever been. Fourteen months ago, teams chose between GPT-4, Claude 3, and maybe an open-source alternative. Today you are choosing from GPT-5 and GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Deep Think, Llama 4 Scout and Maverick, DeepSeek V3.2, Qwen3-235B, Mistral Large 3, Grok 4, and dozens of specialized variants optimized for code, medicine, law, reasoning, and edge deployment. Each model has different pricing, different capabilities, different failure modes, and different compliance implications.

This chapter maps the territory. Not as a static snapshot that will be outdated by March, but as a framework for understanding model categories, capability tiers, provider dynamics, and the velocity of change that makes model selection a continuous discipline rather than a one-time decision.

*The landscape is vast, but the categories are stable. Learn to see models as capability classes, not brand names, and your selection process will survive every release cycle.*
