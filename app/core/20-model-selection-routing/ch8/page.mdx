# Chapter 8 — Open-Source vs Proprietary: The Self-Hosting Decision

The build-versus-buy decision for AI models has never been more consequential or more nuanced than in January 2026. Open-weight models like Llama 4 Maverick and DeepSeek V3.2 now match or exceed proprietary models on many tasks. Self-hosting infrastructure has matured with vLLM, TGI, and managed endpoints. But the total cost of self-hosting — GPUs, ops burden, security, upgrade cycles, staffing — still surprises teams who only looked at the per-token math.

This chapter covers the full decision. What changed in 2026. Data residency requirements. Self-hosting economics. Inference infrastructure. Open-weight quality. Vendor lock-in. Provider-agnostic abstractions. Hybrid architectures. Licensing. Total cost. Migration paths. Data routing policy.

*The question is not whether open-source is good enough. In 2026, it often is. The question is whether you are ready to operate it — and whether the total cost is actually lower than the API bill you are trying to escape.*
