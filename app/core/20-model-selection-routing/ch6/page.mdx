# Chapter 6 — Multi-Model Architectures: Orchestrating Multiple Models in One System

In 2026, every serious production AI system uses more than one model. The question is not whether you will run multiple models — it is whether you will orchestrate them deliberately or stumble into a multi-model architecture by accident. Deliberate multi-model design gives you the best cost, quality, and latency tradeoffs available. Accidental multi-model design gives you a tangle of provider dependencies, inconsistent behavior, and a cost structure nobody can explain.

This chapter covers the architectures, patterns, and pitfalls of running multiple models in one system. Pipeline patterns. Orchestrator-worker patterns. Ensembles. Verifier-generator pairs. Multi-provider mixing. Tokenizer differences. Prompt portability. Multi-model testing and cost accounting.

*One model is a feature. Multiple models, orchestrated well, are a system. The architecture between them matters more than the capability of any single one.*
