# Chapter 3 — Model Routing: Sending the Right Query to the Right Model

Static model selection assigns one model per task. Model routing assigns the right model per query. The difference is the difference between a restaurant with one chef and a restaurant with specialists — a pastry chef for desserts, a grill master for steaks, a sous chef for prep work. Routing is how you get frontier-quality answers on hard queries and small-model speed on easy queries, all within the same product surface, all invisible to the user.

This chapter covers every routing strategy in production use as of January 2026. Complexity-based routing that sends simple queries to cheap models and hard queries to frontier. Confidence-based routing that tries a cheap model first and escalates on uncertainty. Cascading architectures. Classifier-based routers. Rule-based dispatchers. Semantic routing. Risk-aware, cost-aware, and latency-aware routing. Hybrid strategies that combine multiple signals. And the operational layer — router evaluation, failure modes, observability, drift detection, and adversarial attacks on the routing layer itself.

*Model selection decides what you can use. Model routing decides what you actually use, query by query, in real time. This is where cost optimization and quality optimization stop being in conflict.*
