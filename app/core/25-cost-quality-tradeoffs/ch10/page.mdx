# Chapter 10 — Organizational Frameworks, Incentives, and Human Factors

The hardest cost-quality problems are not technical. They are organizational. A model routing strategy is an engineering problem with measurable outcomes. But deciding which team owns the cost-quality tradeoff, how to structure incentives so engineers and product managers optimize for the same goal, and how to prevent cognitive biases from systematically distorting budget decisions, those are human problems that no architecture diagram can solve.

Most organizations get these decisions wrong in predictable ways. Engineering teams optimize for quality because that is what they are trained to care about. Finance teams optimize for cost because that is what they are measured on. Product teams promise capabilities that require premium models to customers paying standard prices. Nobody owns the tradeoff itself, so it lives in the gap between teams, resolved by whoever has the most political power in the room rather than whoever has the best data. The result is AI systems that are simultaneously over-engineered in some areas and under-invested in others, with no coherent strategy connecting the two.

This chapter provides the organizational infrastructure that makes cost-quality decisions systematic instead of political. Recurring review rituals that force tradeoff decisions onto the calendar. Tier-based quality policies that establish different standards for different stakes. Budget allocation frameworks that distribute spend across AI components based on impact. Optimization backlogs that prioritize cost-quality improvements by return on investment. Incentive alignment strategies that prevent teams from optimizing for the wrong metric. And a maturity model that gives you a roadmap from ad hoc cost management to the kind of systematic discipline that turns cost efficiency into a durable competitive advantage.

*This is where cost-quality management becomes a discipline instead of a series of ad hoc decisions. The journey from reactive cost-cutting to systematic cost-quality optimization is the difference between teams that survive scaling and teams that thrive through it.*
