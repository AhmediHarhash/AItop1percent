# Chapter 9 — Scaling Inflection Points and Strategic Cost Evolution

Cost-quality tradeoffs do not scale linearly. The strategies that keep a system efficient at ten thousand requests per day become liabilities at ten million. Caching goes from a nice optimization to a hard requirement. Multi-model routing goes from interesting experiment to the only way to stay within budget. Build-versus-buy economics flip entirely as volume rises and API costs that once seemed reasonable start consuming the majority of gross margin. Every growing AI system hits inflection points where the old approach stops working and a fundamentally different cost strategy becomes necessary.

These inflection points are predictable if you know where to look. There is a volume threshold where caching becomes mandatory, a complexity-savings crossover where multi-model routing pays for its own overhead, a scale at which self-hosted models start beating API providers on unit economics, and a fixed-cost amortization curve that transforms infrastructure investments from liabilities into competitive advantages. Knowing when each inflection arrives, and preparing for it before it hits, is the difference between scaling gracefully and scrambling to cut costs while quality degrades.

This chapter also covers the hardest decision in cost-quality management: when to deliberately reduce quality. Not every use case deserves the same investment. Not every edge case is worth serving. Sometimes the highest-ROI move is killing a feature that costs too much per query, de-scoping the long tail of expensive edge cases, or accepting a lower quality bar for segments where users do not notice the difference. These are not failures of ambition. They are acts of strategic discipline.

*Inflection points are structural. But the decisions at those inflection points are made by humans, in organizations, with budgets, incentives, and biases. The final chapter turns to the human side: how teams actually make cost-quality decisions, and why they systematically get them wrong.*
