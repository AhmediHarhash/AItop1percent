# 8.7 — Red-Teaming and Adversarial Testing Budgets: Investing Before Incidents

Most teams treat red-teaming as a pre-launch checkbox: run a few adversarial prompts, confirm the model does not say anything terrible, and ship. This approach catches the obvious failures and misses the ones that actually matter — the creative, domain-specific attacks that a motivated adversary will find within weeks of launch. The prompts that bypass your content filter by embedding harmful requests inside translation tasks. The jailbreaks that exploit your system prompt's structure rather than its content. The multi-turn manipulations that gradually steer the model into producing outputs it would refuse in a single turn. A checkbox red-team catches none of these, because these attacks require sustained creative effort from skilled adversarial testers — and sustained creative effort costs money.

The uncomfortable truth is that red-teaming is not a one-time activity. It is an ongoing operational expense, as continuous as monitoring, as recurring as your cloud bill. The threat landscape shifts every time a new jailbreak technique surfaces on a forum, every time your model is updated, every time you add a new feature that expands the attack surface. A red-team exercise that was thorough in January is incomplete by March. Teams that budget for a single pre-launch red-team and nothing afterward are building a lock and never changing it, in a neighborhood where the burglars share lock-picking tutorials online every week.

## The Components of a Red-Teaming Budget

A comprehensive adversarial testing budget has four distinct components, each with different cost profiles, cadences, and value propositions. Most teams fund one or two and neglect the rest, leaving gaps that adversaries will find.

**Internal red-teaming** is the cost of diverting your own engineers, product managers, and domain experts from feature work to adversarial testing. This is not free. An engineer who spends two days per month probing the system for vulnerabilities is an engineer who is not building features, fixing bugs, or improving infrastructure. At a fully loaded cost of $150,000 to $250,000 per year for a senior engineer, two days per month represents $12,500 to $21,000 in annual opportunity cost per person. A team of four internal red-teamers working two days per month adds up to $50,000 to $84,000 per year in redirected engineering capacity. The advantage of internal red-teaming is domain depth. Your own engineers understand the system's architecture, its edge cases, and the specific ways users interact with it. They know which prompts are common, which features are new, and where the model's weaknesses cluster. The disadvantage is familiarity bias. People who built the system test it the way they built it. They share the same mental models, the same assumptions, and the same blind spots as the people who designed the safety measures.

**External red-teaming engagements** bring in specialized firms or independent security researchers who test your system with fresh eyes and professional adversarial methodology. In 2026, the AI red-teaming services market has grown rapidly — from roughly $1.3 billion in 2025, driven by the EU AI Act's compliance requirements and the wave of high-profile AI safety failures across the industry. A thorough initial engagement from a specialized firm typically costs $30,000 to $100,000, depending on the scope, the complexity of your system, and the depth of the assessment. A medical AI system with patient-facing outputs and regulatory exposure sits at the high end. A customer support chatbot with limited scope sits at the low end. External engagements typically last two to six weeks and produce a detailed report of vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and remediation recommendations. The value is perspective. External testers do not share your assumptions. They attack the system the way an actual adversary would — creatively, persistently, and without respect for the design decisions you thought were clever.

**Automated adversarial testing tools** provide continuous, scalable vulnerability scanning that runs between human-led engagements. Tools like Mindgard, Garak, and other emerging platforms in the 2026 landscape can run thousands of adversarial prompts per hour across known attack categories — prompt injection, jailbreaking, data extraction, role manipulation, encoding-based bypasses, and multilingual attacks. The cost ranges from $2,000 to $8,000 per month depending on volume, the number of attack categories covered, and integration requirements. Automated tools excel at regression testing — ensuring that a vulnerability you fixed last month has not resurfaced after a model update — and at covering the long tail of known attack patterns that no human team has time to test manually. They are poor at discovering genuinely novel attacks, because they operate from databases of known techniques rather than creative adversarial reasoning.

**Bug bounty programs** open your system to the broader security research community, offering financial rewards for discovered vulnerabilities. OpenAI runs its bug bounty through Bugcrowd. Other companies run programs through HackerOne or manage them independently. The cost structure is variable — you pay only for validated vulnerabilities — but the range is meaningful. Bounties for AI-specific vulnerabilities typically range from $500 for low-severity issues to $20,000 or more for critical safety failures. A well-run bug bounty program also incurs management overhead: triaging submissions, validating reports, communicating with researchers, and maintaining the program infrastructure. Expect $3,000 to $10,000 per month in management costs on top of the bounty payouts themselves. The advantage of bug bounties is scale. You get hundreds or thousands of creative adversarial testers for a fraction of what it would cost to hire them. The disadvantage is noise. A popular bug bounty program generates many low-quality submissions that require time to triage.

## Building the Annual Red-Teaming Budget

The total annual budget depends on your system's risk profile, your regulatory exposure, and the number of models and features in production. A mid-size company with a customer-facing AI product, moderate regulatory exposure, and a team of 15 to 25 engineers should expect to invest in the range of $150,000 to $350,000 per year across all four components.

Here is how that breaks down for a representative scenario. Internal red-teaming: three engineers spending two days per month, at a combined opportunity cost of roughly $55,000 per year. External engagements: two comprehensive assessments per year, one at launch and one at mid-year after significant updates, at $50,000 each totaling $100,000. Automated adversarial tooling: continuous scanning at $4,000 per month, totaling $48,000 per year. Bug bounty program: management overhead of $5,000 per month plus an estimated $30,000 in annual bounty payouts, totaling $90,000. The grand total is approximately $293,000 per year.

That number makes finance teams uncomfortable. It is almost $300,000 per year spent on finding problems, not building features. It is easy to cut in a budget review because the benefits are invisible — prevented incidents that never happened, vulnerabilities that were closed before they were exploited, attacks that failed because the defenses were tested. The challenge of selling red-teaming budgets is that you are selling insurance, and insurance feels expensive until the event it covers actually happens.

## The Economics of Adversarial Coverage

Not all attack categories are equally likely or equally dangerous. A smart red-teaming budget allocates more resources to the attack vectors that matter most for your specific system, rather than spreading effort evenly across every theoretical vulnerability.

**Adversarial coverage** is the percentage of known attack categories that your testing covers with at least some level of effort. Industry surveys from 2024-2025 consistently showed that most companies with AI red-teaming programs covered fewer than 40 percent of known attack categories. They tested for basic jailbreaks and prompt injection but neglected multi-turn manipulation, encoding-based bypasses, indirect prompt injection through retrieved content, model extraction attempts, and domain-specific attacks that exploit the model's specialized knowledge.

The coverage gap matters because adversaries do not limit themselves to the categories you tested. A financial services company that tested its model against basic jailbreaks but not against attempts to extract internal policy documents through carefully constructed prompts learned this the hard way when a researcher demonstrated that conversational probing could surface internal FAQ content — an incident that cost $3 million in remediation and triggered regulatory scrutiny.

Prioritizing coverage requires a risk-weighted approach. Map your attack categories and assign each one a risk score based on two factors: the probability that someone will attempt this attack against your specific system, and the severity of the impact if the attack succeeds. A healthcare AI faces high probability and catastrophic severity for attacks that extract patient data or generate harmful medical advice. The same system faces low probability for model extraction attacks because the adversary gains little from copying the model. A consumer chatbot faces high probability for jailbreaks and offensive content generation, but moderate severity because the immediate harm is reputational rather than physical. Your red-teaming budget should weight spending toward the high-probability, high-severity quadrant. A system where 80 percent of risk concentrates in three attack categories should spend 80 percent of its adversarial testing budget on those three categories, not distribute evenly across twenty.

## Cadence: Why Annual Testing Is Not Enough

Red-teaming on an annual or semi-annual cycle leaves dangerous gaps. The AI threat landscape moves faster than an annual cadence can track.

Consider the timeline. You conduct a thorough red-team engagement in January. The team finds and remediates twelve vulnerabilities. By March, your model provider has released an updated version with different behavior on edge cases. By April, a new jailbreak technique has been published that works on models fine-tuned with instruction-following data — which describes your model. By June, you have added a new feature that accepts user-uploaded documents, creating an indirect prompt injection surface that did not exist when the January engagement was conducted. By September, a competitor suffers a high-profile incident caused by an attack vector that your January engagement did not cover because it was not yet known. Your system may be vulnerable to the same attack, but you will not know until your next scheduled engagement in January of the following year — a twelve-month exposure window.

The solution is a layered cadence. Automated adversarial scanning runs continuously — daily or weekly — catching regressions and testing against newly added attack patterns. Internal red-teaming happens monthly, with engineers spending focused time probing specific features or attack categories on a rotating schedule. External engagements happen semi-annually or after significant system changes — a major model swap, a new feature launch, or an expansion into a new domain. Bug bounty programs run continuously by definition. This layered approach ensures that no attack category goes untested for more than a few weeks, while reserving the most expensive resource — external experts — for the moments when fresh perspective matters most.

## Measuring Red-Teaming ROI

The return on investment of red-teaming is notoriously difficult to measure because it is defined by things that did not happen. You cannot easily quantify the incidents that your red-teaming program prevented, because by definition those incidents never occurred. This makes red-teaming budgets perpetually vulnerable to cuts.

There are, however, proxy metrics that make the value visible. **Vulnerability discovery rate** tracks how many new vulnerabilities each testing method finds per dollar spent. If your external engagement finds 15 actionable vulnerabilities at $60,000, the cost per vulnerability is $4,000. If your automated tools find 8 actionable vulnerabilities per month at $4,000 per month, the cost per vulnerability is $500. These numbers help you allocate budget across methods. They do not prove the program's total value, but they demonstrate that vulnerabilities exist, are being found, and would have persisted without the testing.

**Time to discovery** tracks how long a vulnerability exists before your testing finds it. If a new jailbreak technique is published on Monday and your automated tools catch it by Wednesday, the exposure window is two days. If you rely on semi-annual external engagements, the exposure window could be six months. Shorter discovery windows mean less time for adversaries to exploit the vulnerability.

**Remediation velocity** tracks how quickly discovered vulnerabilities are actually fixed after discovery. A red-teaming program that finds thirty vulnerabilities but only fixes ten is providing 33 percent of its potential value. This metric also reveals organizational bottlenecks. If remediation is slow because engineering prioritizes features over security fixes, the red-teaming budget is being partially wasted — not because the testing is bad, but because the organization is not acting on its findings.

The most persuasive metric for executive audiences is **comparative incident rate**. If your system has been publicly deployed for twelve months with an active red-teaming program and has experienced zero safety incidents, while industry peers without comparable programs have averaged 2.3 incidents per year with average costs of $500,000 per incident, the implied value of your program is $1.15 million per year — well above the $300,000 you spent. This comparison is imperfect and somewhat circumstantial, but it is the language that budget approvers understand. Risk reduction, expressed in dollar terms, relative to peers.

## The Regulatory Pressure on Adversarial Testing

The EU AI Act, fully enforceable from August 2026, has transformed red-teaming from a best practice into a compliance requirement for many systems. High-risk AI systems must undergo conformity assessments that include testing for vulnerabilities and robustness against adversarial inputs. General-purpose AI models with systemic risk — defined as models trained with more than ten to the power of twenty-five floating point operations — must conduct and document adversarial testing as part of their obligations under the GPAI Code of Practice finalized in mid-2025.

The penalties for non-compliance are severe. Violations of high-risk system obligations carry fines of up to 15 million euros or 3 percent of global annual turnover. Violations of prohibited practices carry fines of up to 35 million euros or 7 percent of global turnover. These are not theoretical maximums. As enforcement intensifies through 2026 and national authorities build their inspection capabilities, companies that cannot demonstrate documented, ongoing adversarial testing face real financial exposure.

For teams operating in regulated industries, the red-teaming budget is therefore partially a compliance cost — as mandatory as financial audits, as non-optional as GDPR data protection impact assessments. The budget question shifts from "should we invest in red-teaming?" to "how much do we need to invest to meet our compliance obligations, and how much more should we invest beyond compliance to protect against threats that regulators have not yet codified?"

## Scaling Red-Teaming as Your System Grows

Red-teaming costs do not scale linearly with system complexity. They scale faster than linearly, because each new feature, model, and integration point creates interaction effects that multiply the attack surface.

A system with one model and one feature has a manageable attack surface. Add a second model with routing logic, and the attack surface grows — not by two times, but by more, because the routing logic itself becomes an attack vector. Add retrieval-augmented generation, and the attack surface grows again because the retrieval pipeline introduces indirect prompt injection via document content. Add tool use, and the attack surface expands to include every external system the model can interact with. Add multi-turn memory, and the attack surface includes all the state manipulation techniques that exploit conversation history.

A rough heuristic: for each doubling of system complexity — measured as the number of models multiplied by the number of integration points — expect red-teaming costs to increase by 50 to 80 percent. A system that cost $150,000 per year to red-team when it had one model and one integration will cost $225,000 to $270,000 when it has two models and two integrations, and $340,000 to $486,000 when it has four models and four integrations. These numbers are approximate, but the trajectory is real. Teams that budget red-teaming as a fixed annual line item find their coverage shrinking as their system grows, leaving an ever-widening gap between what is tested and what is deployed.

The mitigation is to tie your red-teaming budget to system complexity, not to a fixed dollar amount. Define a per-model, per-integration testing allocation and scale it automatically as the system grows. If every new model integration triggers a $15,000 focused red-team assessment and $1,000 per month in additional automated scanning, the budget scales with the risk surface rather than lagging behind it.

## The Opportunity Cost of Not Investing

The most important number in red-teaming economics is the one you never want to calculate: the cost of the incident that would have been caught.

A fintech company in late 2024 deployed a customer-facing financial advisor chatbot without any external red-teaming, relying entirely on internal testing by the development team. Three months after launch, a security researcher demonstrated that a sequence of eight carefully crafted prompts could make the chatbot reveal internal compliance guidelines, including specific dollar thresholds for transaction monitoring. The researcher disclosed responsibly, but the disclosure triggered a mandatory regulatory notification, a third-party security audit costing $180,000, a two-week feature freeze while the vulnerability was remediated, and six months of enhanced regulatory oversight. The total cost was approximately $420,000 in direct expenses plus an estimated $200,000 in lost engineering productivity during the feature freeze and audit. An external red-team engagement that would have caught this vulnerability before launch would have cost $45,000.

The ratio is not unusual. Industry patterns consistently show that remediation after discovery costs five to fifteen times more than prevention through proactive testing. The engineering hours spent in emergency response, the legal and compliance costs of mandatory disclosures, the feature freezes that halt product development, the reputational damage that lingers — these costs compound in ways that dwarf the up-front investment in adversarial testing. The $300,000 annual red-teaming budget that felt expensive in the budget review looks like the best investment the company ever made when compared to a single incident that costs $2 million.

Red-teaming economics are not complicated. They are uncomfortable, because they require spending money on problems that have not happened yet, in a world where budget pressure always favors problems that have already happened. The teams that build this discipline — that budget for adversarial testing the way they budget for infrastructure and staffing, as a predictable, recurring operational cost — are the ones that avoid the headlines. The next subchapter examines what happens when the investment is skipped: the full, concrete cost of safety failures, and why the tax is always cheaper than the fine.
