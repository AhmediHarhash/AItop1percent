# Chapter 6 — Evaluation Cost Management

Evaluation is not free. Every LLM-as-judge call burns tokens. Every human review session burns hours. Every regression test suite burns compute. Teams that build rigorous eval infrastructure often discover, sometimes with genuine shock, that they are spending more on measuring quality than on improving it. The eval tax is real, and it compounds with every new feature, every new model swap, and every new customer segment you need to validate.

But cutting eval spend is not the answer. Teams that slash their evaluation budgets do not save money. They shift cost from measurement to incident response, from proactive detection to customer-facing failures, from controlled experiments to emergency rollbacks. The real discipline is not spending less on evaluation. It is spending smarter: sampling instead of exhausting, escalating instead of blanket-checking, and building cost models that forecast eval spend as traffic grows so that evaluation scales sustainably rather than becoming the budget line item that gets killed in the next quarterly review.

This chapter covers every lever for managing eval cost without losing signal. Sampling strategies that evaluate a fraction of traffic while preserving statistical validity. LLM-as-judge cost optimization that assigns cheaper models to routine checks and reserves expensive judges for ambiguous cases. Human review budgets that concentrate expert time where it actually moves metrics. Progressive evaluation pipelines that start cheap and escalate only when early signals warrant deeper inspection. And the cost of not evaluating at all, which is always higher than the eval budget it replaces.

*Eval spend is manageable. What is not manageable is the three-way tradeoff that sits behind every real-time AI decision: latency, cost, and quality, all pulling in different directions at the same time.*
