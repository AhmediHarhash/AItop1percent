# Chapter 2 — Revenue-Quality Economics

Most AI teams can tell you their model's accuracy to two decimal places. Almost none can tell you what a one-point improvement in that accuracy is worth in revenue. This gap between quality measurement and business impact is where products die quietly. A team that improves quality by 5% at triple the cost may be destroying the business. A team that accepts 3% lower quality to halve their cost per query may be building the only product in their market that can actually scale. The difference is not technical skill — it is economic reasoning applied to quality decisions.

This chapter connects quality investment directly to the numbers that keep a company alive: conversion rates, retention curves, contribution margins, and pricing power. You will learn how to measure the revenue elasticity of your AI quality, how to identify quality improvements that users never notice and quality failures that cause immediate churn, and how to build a sensitivity model that tells you exactly how much each quality point is worth in your specific product. You will also confront the demo-to-production cost gap — the dangerous illusion that proof-of-concept economics have anything to do with production economics.

*Revenue tells you where quality matters. The next question is which technical lever gives you the biggest cost-quality swing — and in most systems, that lever is model selection.*
