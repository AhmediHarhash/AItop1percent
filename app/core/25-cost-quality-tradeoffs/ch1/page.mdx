# Chapter 1 — The Tradeoff Mindset

Cost-quality is not a compromise you make once and forget. It is a discipline you practice continuously, like testing or monitoring. Teams that treat cost optimization as a one-time cleanup exercise always end up in the same place: either spending so much that the product cannot survive its own margins, or cutting so aggressively that quality degrades until users leave. The teams that win treat cost and quality as two variables in one equation, and they make every tradeoff deliberately, with evidence, on the record.

This chapter builds the mental model you need before touching any optimization lever. You will learn why chasing perfect quality is a trap, how to identify the knee point where additional investment stops paying off, how to define the operating envelope your product can sustain, and why deferring cost discipline to "later" is one of the most reliable ways to kill an AI product. You will also learn to make tradeoff decisions explicit and auditable, so that six months from now your team can trace why a particular model, prompt length, or caching strategy was chosen — and whether that decision still holds.

*With the tradeoff mindset in place, we move to the question that connects all of this to the business: how do your quality decisions actually affect revenue, retention, and willingness to pay?*
