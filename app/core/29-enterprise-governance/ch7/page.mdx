# Chapter 7 — Risk Management, Board Oversight, and Executive Reporting

AI risk management fails when it stays abstract. A taxonomy of risks does not change board behavior. A risk register that nobody reads does not prevent incidents. This chapter moves risk management from theoretical classification to operational practice — quantifying financial exposure, setting risk appetite that means something, building board-level oversight that actually governs, and communicating AI risk to executives who control budgets and strategic direction. By 2026, nearly half of Fortune 100 companies cite AI as a board-level risk. The question is no longer whether boards should oversee AI — it is whether your board has the information, the structure, and the authority to do it well.

*Boards do not act on taxonomies. They act on financial exposure. The organizations that govern AI risk effectively are the ones that translate abstract concerns into numbers their leadership can act on.*
