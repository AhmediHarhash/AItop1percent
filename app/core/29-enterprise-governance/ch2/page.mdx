# Chapter 2 — Organizational Design for AI: Teams, Roles, and Authority

Governance lives or dies in the org chart. Policies without people to enforce them are decoration. Review boards without decision authority are theater. This chapter covers the organizational structures that make AI governance operational — from centralized models that concentrate expertise to hub-and-spoke designs that scale across business units, from the emerging Chief AI Officer role to the cross-functional governance bodies that prevent any single function from owning a decision that belongs to many. You will learn who does this work, what authority they need, and how to design governance organizations that accelerate rather than obstruct.

*The right org structure does not just house governance — it determines whether governance enables velocity or kills it.*
