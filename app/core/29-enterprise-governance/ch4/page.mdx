# Chapter 4 — Regulatory Compliance: The EU AI Act, US Landscape, and Global Requirements

The regulatory landscape for AI shifted from theoretical to enforceable between 2024 and 2026. The EU AI Act is in force. The GPAI Code of Practice defines what model providers must do. The August 2026 deadline for high-risk AI system compliance is months away. Meanwhile, the US operates a patchwork of state laws, sector-specific guidance, and executive policy shifts. This chapter provides actionable compliance guidance — not legal summaries, but operational playbooks for what your organization must build, document, and prove across every jurisdiction where you deploy AI systems.
