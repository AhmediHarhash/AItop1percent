# Chapter 9 — Audit, Assurance, and Accountability

Governance without proof is governance theater. Regulators do not ask whether you have a policy — they ask whether you can demonstrate the control works. Auditors do not accept descriptions of your process — they require evidence that the process ran, that it caught what it was supposed to catch, and that exceptions were escalated. This chapter covers the full assurance landscape: building internal audit capability for AI, engaging third-party auditors, testing for algorithmic bias at scale, managing evidence trails, and preparing for the regulatory inspections that are already underway in 2026. The Control Proof Standard — the ability to prove a governance control works, not just that it exists — is the line that separates mature programs from aspirational ones.

*The question is not whether your governance program looks good on paper. The question is whether you can prove it works when someone with enforcement authority asks.*
