# Chapter 3 — Governance Frameworks and Standards

Frameworks are how governance scales beyond individual judgment. Without a shared structure — a common language for risk, a consistent process for review, a documented standard for what "good" looks like — every team reinvents governance from scratch. This chapter covers the external frameworks that have become industry standard by 2026, from NIST AI RMF to ISO 42001, and teaches you how to translate them into internal policies that people actually follow. You will learn the difference between policies that exist on paper and policies that change behavior, and how to build governance documentation that serves engineers, auditors, and leadership simultaneously.

*A framework is not a decoration. It is the shared operating language that lets hundreds of people make consistent governance decisions without escalating everything to one committee.*
