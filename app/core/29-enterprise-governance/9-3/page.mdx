# 29.9.3 -- Third-Party AI Audits: When, Why, and How to Engage External Auditors

Most organizations assume third-party AI audits are a regulatory requirement reserved for heavily regulated industries -- banking, healthcare, high-risk AI under the EU AI Act. This assumption is dangerously narrow. Third-party audits are increasingly a competitive necessity in any industry where AI decisions affect customers, partners, or employees. When an enterprise customer asks whether your AI-powered product has been independently audited and you say no, the conversation shifts from capabilities to risk -- and in 2026, procurement teams at sophisticated buyers have heard enough AI failure stories to treat unaudited AI as a red flag. The question is not whether regulated industries need third-party AI audits. The question is whether any organization deploying AI that affects people can afford to skip them.

## When Third-Party Audits Are Required vs. Strategic

Some third-party audits are mandatory. The EU AI Act's conformity assessment requirements under Article 43 require providers of certain high-risk AI systems to undergo assessment by a notified body -- an authorized external assessor -- rather than relying solely on internal conformity procedures. For high-risk systems listed in Annex III covering areas like biometric identification, critical infrastructure management, employment decisions, creditworthiness assessment, and law enforcement -- providers using harmonized standards may choose between internal control or notified body assessment. But for biometric systems used by law enforcement and immigration authorities, the market surveillance authority itself acts as the assessment body. These are not optional. If your system falls into these categories and you intend to operate in the EU after August 2026, conformity assessment is a legal prerequisite.

Beyond mandatory requirements, third-party audits serve strategic purposes that internal audit cannot. They provide **independent credibility** -- your internal audit team reports to your own board, and however competent they are, their independence has organizational limits. A third-party auditor has no incentive to find favorable results, which is precisely why their assurance carries more weight with external stakeholders. They satisfy **contractual requirements** -- enterprise customers in financial services, healthcare, and government increasingly require independent AI audit reports as a condition of procurement. They support **voluntary standards adoption** -- achieving ISO 42001 certification, for example, requires external assessment, and seventy-six percent of organizations surveyed by the Cloud Security Alliance in 2025 reported plans to pursue AI governance frameworks like ISO 42001. And they provide **litigation protection** -- if your AI system causes harm, demonstrating that it was independently audited and that you remediated findings shows good faith that pure self-assessment cannot match.

The strategic value is highest in three scenarios. First, when you sell AI products or AI-powered services to other businesses, where buyer due diligence increasingly expects independent assurance. Second, when your AI systems make decisions that directly affect individuals -- hiring, lending, insurance, healthcare -- where the reputational and legal cost of an undetected failure is catastrophic. Third, when you are entering a new market or regulatory jurisdiction where demonstrating AI governance maturity opens doors that would otherwise remain closed.

## The Emerging Third-Party AI Audit Market

The market for third-party AI auditing is maturing rapidly but unevenly. Understanding the landscape helps you choose the right partner for your needs.

**Specialist AI audit firms** like Holistic AI, Credo AI, and BABL AI built their practices specifically around AI governance and algorithmic auditing. Holistic AI reports having reviewed over a hundred AI projects covering more than ten thousand algorithms across more than twenty jurisdictions. BABL AI employs certified independent auditors and follows globally recognized assurance engagement standards modeled on financial auditing rigor. These firms offer deep technical expertise in bias detection, fairness assessment, and AI-specific risk evaluation. Their limitation is scale -- they may not have the global reach or the brand recognition that a board audit committee or a large enterprise customer expects.

**Big Four accounting firms** -- Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC -- are building AI audit practices that combine their traditional assurance credibility with growing technical capability. KPMG received ISO 42001 certification in the United States in late 2025 and has integrated AI audit services into its broader technology assurance practice. Deloitte expanded AI capabilities within its Omnia global audit platform. These firms bring institutional credibility, global reach, and existing relationships with audit committees and regulators. Their limitation is that AI auditing is still a newer capability within these firms, and the depth of technical AI expertise can vary significantly by office and engagement team.

**Consulting and advisory firms** offer AI risk assessments that may not carry the formal assurance designation of an audit but provide valuable independent perspective on governance maturity, risk exposure, and compliance readiness. These engagements are often lighter in scope and cost, making them useful for organizations that want an external view before committing to a full audit.

**Notified bodies** -- authorized under the EU AI Act to perform conformity assessments for high-risk AI systems -- are a category still taking shape in 2026. The European Commission is in the process of designating notified bodies, and the market for conformity assessment services is expected to develop further as the August 2026 enforcement date approaches. If your systems require notified body assessment, begin identifying qualified bodies early, because demand is likely to outstrip supply in the initial enforcement period.

## Scoping the Engagement: What to Include, What to Exclude

Poor scoping is the most common cause of third-party audit engagements that cost too much and deliver too little. A well-scoped engagement defines clear boundaries around which AI systems are in scope, which governance domains will be assessed, what depth of technical testing is expected, and what deliverables the engagement will produce.

Start with the systems. Not every AI system in your portfolio needs third-party audit attention. Focus on the systems that are highest risk, customer-facing, regulatory-relevant, or contractually required to have independent assurance. A typical first engagement covers two to five AI systems rather than the entire portfolio. Trying to audit everything in a single engagement dilutes depth and produces surface-level findings that do not justify the cost.

Define the governance domains. Will the audit cover the full governance framework -- inventory, risk classification, data governance, model validation, deployment controls, monitoring, and vendor management? Or will it focus on specific domains like fairness and bias testing, data privacy compliance, or operational controls? A full-scope governance audit provides comprehensive assurance but requires more time and budget. A focused audit provides deep assurance on one domain and can be completed more efficiently. Match the scope to your immediate needs -- if your primary concern is demonstrating fairness in a hiring algorithm, a focused bias audit is more valuable than a broad governance review.

Set the technical depth. A governance-level audit reviews documentation, interviews process owners, and samples evidence. A technical audit goes deeper -- independently evaluating model outputs, running fairness tests on actual system behavior, reviewing training data for quality and representativeness, and stress-testing the system under adversarial conditions. Technical audits require more specialized expertise and cost more, but they produce findings that governance-only reviews cannot surface.

Define deliverables explicitly. At minimum, expect a written report with findings categorized by severity, recommended remediation actions, and a management response section. Some engagements also produce a certification or attestation letter suitable for sharing with customers or regulators. Others produce a detailed remediation roadmap. Clarify what you will receive and what you can share externally before the engagement begins.

## Managing the Audit Relationship

The relationship between your organization and the external auditor requires careful management to balance transparency with appropriate information protection.

**Information sharing** should be governed by a formal engagement agreement that specifies what data and systems the auditor will access, how that access will be provided, and what confidentiality protections apply. External auditors typically need access to model documentation, evaluation results, training data descriptions (though not always the raw data itself), deployment records, monitoring dashboards, and governance process documentation. For technical audits, they may also need API access to the AI system to run their own tests. Define the access method, the duration, and the data handling requirements before the engagement begins.

**Access controls** matter because external auditors are, by definition, external. Provide read-only access wherever possible. Create time-limited accounts that expire at the end of the engagement. Avoid granting auditors access to production systems with real customer data unless the audit specifically requires it -- and if it does, ensure the access is logged, the data is handled under your data protection agreements, and the auditor's data security practices meet your standards.

**Confidentiality** protections should flow in both directions. The auditor must protect your proprietary information, trade secrets, and customer data. You must allow the auditor sufficient access to perform a meaningful assessment. Non-disclosure agreements should be in place before any information sharing begins. Clarify whether the auditor can reference your organization in their marketing materials, case studies, or public communications -- many organizations prefer anonymity.

**Point of contact management** is more important than it seems. Assign a single internal coordinator -- typically someone from the AI governance team or internal audit -- to manage the external auditor's information requests, schedule interviews, and track open items. Without a coordinator, auditors send requests to multiple people, receive inconsistent responses, and lose time chasing information. The coordinator also ensures that the auditor receives accurate, complete information rather than the partial or outdated documentation that busy teams sometimes provide when they are managing audit requests alongside their regular work.

## What to Expect from Audit Findings

Third-party audit findings typically use a severity rating scale -- critical, high, medium, low, or a numbered equivalent. Understanding what each level means and how to respond is essential for getting value from the engagement.

**Critical findings** indicate controls that are absent, fundamentally ineffective, or creating active risk. A model making regulated decisions with no fairness testing, a high-risk system operating without monitoring, or a deployment with no rollback capability would qualify. Critical findings demand immediate remediation -- typically within thirty to sixty days -- and may require interim risk mitigation such as increased human review or reduced system autonomy until the fix is in place.

**High findings** indicate controls that exist but are significantly deficient. Evaluation data that does not represent the production population, monitoring dashboards that are not reviewed on a regular cadence, or risk classifications that have not been updated in over a year. Remediation timelines typically range from sixty to ninety days.

**Medium findings** indicate controls that are operating but could be strengthened -- documentation gaps, inconsistent processes across teams, or monitoring thresholds that have not been calibrated to current performance levels. Remediation timelines of ninety to one hundred eighty days are standard.

**Low findings** are observations and suggestions for improvement that do not represent governance deficiencies but could enhance maturity. These are addressed at management's discretion, often folded into planned governance improvement initiatives.

Negotiate remediation timelines at the report stage, not after publication. If a finding is rated high but the remediation requires infrastructure changes that take six months, discuss this with the auditor during the management response phase. Auditors generally accept extended timelines if you demonstrate a credible remediation plan. What they will not accept is a management response that says "noted" with no action and no timeline.

## Budgeting for Third-Party AI Audits

Third-party AI audit costs vary widely based on scope, depth, and the firm engaged. A governance-level review of two to three AI systems by a specialist firm typically ranges from fifty thousand to one hundred fifty thousand dollars. A comprehensive audit including technical testing, fairness assessment, and data governance review for a high-risk system can range from one hundred fifty thousand to four hundred thousand dollars or more, depending on system complexity. Big Four engagements tend to be at the higher end of these ranges due to their overhead structures but also carry more institutional credibility with boards and regulators. ISO 42001 certification engagements typically cost between seventy-five thousand and two hundred thousand dollars for initial certification, with lower costs for annual surveillance audits.

Budget for third-party AI audits as a recurring cost, not a one-time project. If your organization has high-risk AI systems, annual or biennial external audit is the cadence that regulators and customers expect. Build this into the AI governance budget from year one so that audit costs are planned rather than scrambled for when a customer or regulator requests independent assurance.

## Red Flags in Audit Firms

Not every firm marketing "AI audit" services can deliver meaningful assurance. Watch for these warning signs when evaluating potential auditors.

A firm that proposes a methodology identical to their IT general controls audit with AI terminology swapped in has not built genuine AI audit capability. AI auditing requires different skills, different testing methods, and different judgment frameworks than traditional IT auditing. If the proposal reads like a SOC 2 examination with "model" substituted for "system," keep looking.

A firm that cannot name the specific individuals who will perform the engagement, along with their AI expertise, is likely planning to staff the work with generalists who will learn on your engagement. Ask for resumes or biographies of the engagement team. Look for people who have actually evaluated AI systems, not just audited IT environments that happen to include AI.

A firm that promises to audit your entire AI portfolio in two weeks is selling a checkbox exercise, not a meaningful assessment. A thorough audit of even a single high-risk AI system takes three to four weeks of active work. If the timeline seems impossibly compressed, the depth will be impossibly shallow.

A firm with no industry specialization will miss the domain-specific risks that matter most. An AI system in healthcare operates under different regulatory constraints, different fairness requirements, and different risk thresholds than an AI system in e-commerce. Your auditor should understand your industry's specific requirements, not just AI governance in the abstract.

A firm that will not share a sample report or describe their finding format is a firm whose deliverables may not meet your expectations. Ask to see redacted examples of previous AI audit reports before signing the engagement letter. The quality of the report is, ultimately, the quality of the engagement.

The third-party audit provides external validation. The next subchapter moves from general governance auditing to a specific and increasingly demanded capability -- algorithmic auditing for bias, fairness, and discrimination at scale.
