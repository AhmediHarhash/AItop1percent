# Chapter 5 — Model Governance and Lifecycle Management

Most enterprises cannot answer a basic question: how many AI models are running in production right now? The AI Inventory Problem — the inability to see, classify, and track every AI system across the organization — is the single largest governance blind spot in enterprise AI. This chapter covers the full model lifecycle from a governance perspective: inventorying what exists, registering what matters, documenting what auditors need, validating before deployment, monitoring after deployment, managing vendor models you did not build, retiring models that have outlived their purpose, and governing the newest frontier — agentic AI systems that act autonomously.

*You cannot govern what you cannot see. The model registry is where governance becomes concrete — every system named, classified, owned, and tracked from deployment to retirement.*
