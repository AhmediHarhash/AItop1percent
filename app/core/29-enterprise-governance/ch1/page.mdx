# Chapter 1 — The Governance Imperative: Why AI Without Governance Destroys Value

Every enterprise that scales AI confronts the same uncomfortable moment: the models work, the use cases multiply, and nobody can answer who approved what, who owns the risk, or what happens when something breaks at scale. This chapter establishes why governance is not a bureaucratic layer added after innovation — it is the structural prerequisite that makes AI investable, auditable, and sustainable. You will learn what governance actually is, how the 2026 landscape has made it non-optional, and how to design the AI Decision Stack that moves every AI proposal from idea through risk classification, validation, and deployment with the right controls at every stage.

*Before you can govern AI, you need to understand why ungoverned AI is the single largest risk most enterprises are carrying without knowing it.*
