# Chapter 6 — Data Governance for AI Systems

Traditional data governance was built for databases, warehouses, and business intelligence. AI breaks every assumption it was designed around. Training data does not stay in one place — it becomes embedded in model weights, where it can neither be queried nor deleted in the traditional sense. Data lineage must trace not just where data lives but how it influenced a model's behavior. Privacy regulations apply not only to stored data but to data memorized by models during training. This chapter covers what makes AI data governance fundamentally different and how to build governance systems that handle provenance, consent, synthetic data, copyright, retention, and cross-border flows for the AI era.

*The data that trains your model becomes the model. Governing that data after training is like governing the ingredients after the cake is baked — technically possible, practically painful, and better done upfront.*
