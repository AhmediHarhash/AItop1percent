# Chapter 9 — Eval Observability: Monitoring the Systems That Monitor Your AI

An evaluation system that fails silently is worse than no evaluation system at all — it creates false confidence. At scale, eval pipelines develop their own failure modes: backlogs that grow faster than they drain, judge models that drift, alert volumes that overwhelm teams, and score distributions that shift without anyone noticing. This chapter covers the meta-problem of evaluating the evaluator — the health metrics, drift detection, alert management, and dashboards required to trust your evaluation infrastructure.

*Observability tells you whether your eval system is healthy. But the tools you use to build that system matter enormously — and the eval tooling landscape in 2026 has consolidated into distinct tiers. The next chapter maps the market.*
