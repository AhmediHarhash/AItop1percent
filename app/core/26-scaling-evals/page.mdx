# Scaling Evaluation Systems

Evaluation is easy when you have one model, one use case, and a hundred requests a day. You can read the outputs yourself. You can spot the failures by eye. You can fix problems before anyone notices. Then usage grows. The product expands. The team ships faster. And the evaluation system that carried you through the first year becomes the thing that breaks first, fails silently, and costs more than anyone budgeted for.

This section is about what happens after the evaluation fundamentals from Section 3 stop being enough. It is about what happens when the automated eval pipelines from Section 15 need to run at ten thousand times their original scale. It is about the infrastructure, the economics, the sampling strategies, the organizational patterns, and the hard operational decisions that separate teams running evaluation as a side project from teams running evaluation as a production-grade quality operating system.

The gap between monitoring and evaluation is the gap between knowing something changed and knowing whether that change matters. In 2026, most organizations have observability — dashboards, alerts, log aggregation. Far fewer have systematic evaluation — structured measurement of whether the AI system is actually doing what it should. This section closes that gap at scale.

*What worked at a hundred requests breaks at ten thousand, and what worked at ten thousand collapses at a million. The first chapter starts with exactly that story — and the engineering decisions that determine whether you scale your quality system or abandon it.*
