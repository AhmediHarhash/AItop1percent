# Chapter 5 — Distributed Eval Infrastructure: Compute, Pipelines, and Throughput

Evaluation at scale is a distributed systems problem. The eval pipeline that ran as a single script on one machine must become a resilient, parallelized, cost-aware system that processes millions of evaluations per day without blocking releases, dropping results, or burning through your compute budget. This chapter covers the architecture patterns, compute allocation strategies, and reliability engineering required to run evaluation as production infrastructure.

*Infrastructure moves the data. But the data itself — the golden sets, the benchmarks, the adversarial libraries — is what determines whether your evaluations measure anything worth measuring. The next chapter covers dataset management at scale.*
