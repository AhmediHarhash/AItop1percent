# 10.5 — The Build-vs-Buy Decision Matrix: When Custom Tooling Beats Commercial Platforms

Should you build your eval infrastructure or buy it? The answer is almost always "both" — but which parts to build and which to buy depends on three factors that most teams evaluate incorrectly. They overweight the first factor they think of, usually cost, and underweight the two that actually determine long-term success: how unique their evaluation requirements are and whether evaluation quality is a competitive differentiator for their product. Teams that get this decision wrong don't just waste money. They spend six months building commodity infrastructure that a platform handles out of the box, or they spend six months integrating a platform that can't express the evaluation logic their domain requires. Either way, they lose the time they can't afford.

## The Three Decision Factors

The build-versus-buy decision rests on three axes, and you need to evaluate all three before committing resources in either direction.

The first axis is **domain specificity** — how unique are your evaluation requirements compared to what commercial platforms support? If your evals are standard text quality metrics, retrieval accuracy, latency, and hallucination detection, commercial platforms handle these well. They've been refined across thousands of customers. But if your eval criteria encode domain knowledge that doesn't exist in any platform's library — clinical accuracy for radiology reports, regulatory compliance for financial disclosures, safety assessment for autonomous vehicle planning outputs — no commercial platform will express those criteria correctly out of the box.

The second axis is **scale economics** — at what volume do commercial platform costs exceed the cost of running equivalent infrastructure yourself? Most commercial eval platforms charge per evaluation or per seat. At low volume, this is a bargain: you get infrastructure, dashboards, storage, and orchestration for a fraction of what it would cost to build. But pricing scales linearly with volume while infrastructure costs scale sub-linearly. A team running ten thousand evaluations per month will almost always find commercial platforms cheaper. A team running ten million evaluations per month will almost always find custom infrastructure cheaper, even accounting for the engineering time to build and maintain it.

The third axis is **strategic importance** — is evaluation a competitive differentiator or commodity infrastructure for your business? If your product's value proposition depends on quality that competitors can't match, and your eval system is how you measure and maintain that quality, the eval system is strategic infrastructure. Building it yourself means you control the roadmap, the data, and the pace of improvement. If evaluation is important but not a differentiator — you need it to work, but the specifics of how it works don't create competitive advantage — buying saves engineering time for work that does differentiate your product.

## When to Build: The Domain-Specific Components

The components you should almost always build yourself are the ones that encode your competitive advantage. Custom annotation workflows come first. Your reviewers need to evaluate outputs in the context of your domain, with your criteria, in the sequence that makes sense for your product. A generic annotation interface forces your reviewers to adapt their workflow to the tool instead of the tool adapting to their expertise. When a medical reviewer needs to check a radiology report, they need the original imaging study adjacent to the AI output, the patient history for context, and evaluation controls that map to clinical accuracy dimensions. No commercial platform provides this because no commercial platform understands your specific clinical workflow.

Domain-specific judges are the second build-always component. An LLM-as-judge that evaluates whether a financial summary accurately represents the source data requires prompt engineering that encodes your organization's understanding of what "accurate" means for financial summaries. The prompt references your taxonomy of financial instruments, your thresholds for materiality, your definition of misleading omission. This judge is a proprietary asset. Its quality directly determines whether your product improves or stagnates, and handing its development to a platform vendor means handing them control of your quality definition.

Proprietary evaluation metrics are the third. If your business has defined quality dimensions that are specific to your domain — "clinical actionability" for a healthcare AI, "regulatory defensibility" for a compliance system, "pedagogical effectiveness" for an education product — the metrics that measure those dimensions are yours to build. They encode institutional knowledge that took years to develop. They don't exist in any platform's standard metrics library because they shouldn't: they're unique to your business.

## When to Buy: The Commodity Infrastructure

The components you should almost always buy are the ones where building them yourself means reinventing wheels that thousands of teams have already refined.

Pipeline orchestration is the clearest example. Running eval jobs at scale, managing queues, handling retries, parallelizing across compute resources, scheduling periodic evaluations — this is infrastructure that every team needs and that commercial platforms have optimized through years of iteration. Building your own orchestration layer is rarely a differentiator. It's plumbing. Platforms like Braintrust, LangSmith, and Maxim handle this well, and their orchestration is battle-tested across workloads far more diverse than yours.

Result storage and querying follow the same logic. Storing evaluation results, indexing them for retrieval, enabling historical comparison, maintaining audit trails — this is database infrastructure dressed in eval-specific clothing. Commercial platforms provide optimized storage schemas, time-series indexing, and query interfaces that would take months to replicate. Unless you have exotic storage requirements — healthcare data residency constraints, classified information handling — buying this layer saves substantial engineering time.

Dashboard generation and visualization are another buy-almost-always component. Building a good eval dashboard takes longer than most teams expect. It's not just charts — it's interactive filtering, drill-down into individual examples, trend detection, alerting integration, role-based views for different stakeholders. Commercial platforms invest heavily in visualization because it's what customers see and evaluate during purchasing decisions. Your engineering team's time is better spent on the custom eval logic that feeds those dashboards than on the dashboards themselves.

Standard metrics computation — BLEU, ROUGE, semantic similarity, exact match, latency percentiles — is the final commodity layer. These algorithms are well-defined, well-implemented in open-source libraries, and universally available in commercial platforms. Building your own implementation provides no advantage unless you need a non-standard variant.

## The Hybrid Pattern

The highest-performing eval teams in 2026 follow a hybrid pattern: buy the platform, build the custom components that plug into it. The platform provides orchestration, storage, dashboards, and standard metrics. The custom components provide domain-specific judges, proprietary metrics, and specialized annotation workflows. The integration point is the platform's extensibility layer — its ability to accept custom eval functions, custom judge outputs, and custom data schemas.

This hybrid approach works when the platform supports genuine extensibility, not just configuration. The distinction matters. Configuration means choosing from a menu of pre-built options. Extensibility means injecting your own code and logic into the platform's execution pipeline. A platform that lets you pick from fifteen pre-built judge templates is configurable. A platform that lets you deploy your own judge model and route eval jobs to it through the platform's orchestration layer is extensible. The hybrid pattern requires the second.

The practical implementation looks like this: your team deploys custom judge models as services behind your own infrastructure. The commercial platform's orchestration layer calls those judges as evaluation steps, passing in the outputs to evaluate and receiving back structured scores. The platform stores the results, renders them on dashboards, and includes them in trend analysis alongside its own standard metrics. Your team owns the quality logic. The platform owns the infrastructure.

## The Two Mistakes Teams Make

The first mistake is building what you should buy. This manifests as a team spending four months building an eval pipeline orchestration framework — job scheduling, retry logic, queue management, result aggregation — when a commercial platform provides all of this on day one. The team justifies the build decision by citing unique requirements, but the unique requirements turn out to be minor configuration differences that a platform could accommodate. Meanwhile, four months of engineering time that could have gone into better judge models, better annotation workflows, or better eval criteria went into plumbing.

You can spot this mistake by asking a simple question: does this component encode knowledge that is specific to our domain and valuable to our business? Queue management does not. Retry logic does not. Dashboard rendering does not. If the answer is no, you are building commodity infrastructure, and the opportunity cost is the custom work you are not doing instead.

The second mistake is buying what you should build. This manifests as a team adopting a commercial platform's built-in judge models for domain-specific evaluation because they are "good enough" and available immediately. The team avoids the investment of building custom judges. Six months later, they discover that the platform's generic judges miss domain-specific failure modes that matter deeply to their users. The platform judge rates a financial summary as "accurate" because the numbers are correct, but misses that the summary omits a material risk disclosure that a domain expert would flag immediately. The team has been operating on eval scores that do not measure what their users care about.

You can spot this mistake by asking a different question: if a competitor used the exact same evaluation logic, would they measure quality the same way we do? If the answer is yes, your evaluation logic is commodity — the platform's built-in judges are fine. If the answer is no, your evaluation logic is proprietary, and you need to own it.

## The Decision in Practice

For most teams, the split works out roughly the same way. You buy orchestration, storage, dashboards, and standard metrics from a platform. You build custom judges, domain-specific annotation tools, proprietary metrics, and any eval criteria that encode competitive advantage. The platform handles about sixty percent of the work by volume but none of the work that determines whether your evaluation actually measures the right things. Your custom components handle forty percent of the work but represent one hundred percent of the evaluation intelligence.

The decision is not permanent. Teams that start by building everything often migrate commodity components to a platform once they understand which parts are generic. Teams that start by buying everything often pull the domain-specific components back in-house once they discover the platform's limitations. The key is to make the decision consciously, based on the three axes — domain specificity, scale economics, and strategic importance — rather than defaulting to whichever option the most senior engineer on the team prefers.

Once you've decided what to build and what to buy, the next challenge is connecting those components into a coherent system. The next subchapter covers integration patterns for connecting eval tools to your existing infrastructure stack.
