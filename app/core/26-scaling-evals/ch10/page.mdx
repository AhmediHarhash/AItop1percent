# Chapter 10 — The Eval Tooling Landscape: Platforms, Frameworks, and Build-vs-Buy

The evaluation tooling market in 2026 has matured from a scattered collection of open-source scripts into a structured ecosystem of commercial platforms, specialized frameworks, and build-your-own components. The decision of what to build, what to buy, and what to integrate is one of the highest-leverage choices an AI team makes — it determines not just eval capability but velocity, portability, and long-term cost. This chapter maps the landscape, evaluates the trade-offs, and provides the decision framework for choosing the right tooling strategy.

*Tools are necessary but not sufficient. The final chapter covers the organizational operating model that turns eval tooling into a continuous quality engineering practice — the cadences, ownership models, governance structures, and maturity stages that determine whether evaluation scales with your organization or collapses under it.*
