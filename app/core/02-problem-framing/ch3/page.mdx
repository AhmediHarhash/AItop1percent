# Chapter 3 — Task Taxonomy: Classifying What Your AI Actually Does

Once you've decomposed your AI problem into sub-problems, the next question is: **what kind of task is each one?**

This matters more than most teams realize. A generation task and a classification task look similar on the surface — the model receives input and produces output — but they require completely different evaluation strategies, ground truth formats, success criteria, and failure analysis. Treating them the same is like treating surgery and diagnosis as the same medical procedure because both happen in a hospital.

Your task taxonomy is the classification system that tells you how to evaluate each piece of your system, what ground truth to build, and what metrics to track. It's the bridge between decomposition (Chapter 2) and success criteria (Chapter 4). Without it, you're evaluating everything with the same blunt instrument.

This chapter walks you through the five core task types — generation, extraction, classification, transformation, and reasoning — then shows you how compound tasks chain them together and how different product archetypes map to different task profiles.
