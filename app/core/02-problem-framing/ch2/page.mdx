# Chapter 2 — Problem Decomposition: Breaking AI Problems Into Solvable Pieces

"Build an AI customer support agent." That's the kind of request that lands on engineering teams every day. It sounds like one problem. It's actually fifteen.

There's query understanding. There's intent classification. There's knowledge retrieval. There's response generation. There's tone calibration. There's escalation logic. There's conversation memory. There's tool calling. There's safety filtering. Each of these is a distinct sub-problem with its own inputs, outputs, failure modes, and evaluation criteria.

Teams that treat "build a support agent" as one problem build monolithic systems that are impossible to debug, evaluate, or improve. Teams that decompose it into fifteen sub-problems build systems where each piece can be tested, measured, and iterated independently.

This chapter teaches you how to break AI problems apart — systematically, across every major product type, at the right level of granularity. It covers conversational systems, RAG architectures, agentic workflows, multimodal systems, and the human-in-the-loop boundaries that determine what gets automated and what doesn't.
