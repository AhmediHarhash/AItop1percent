# Problem Framing & Task Taxonomy

Before you pick a model, write a prompt, or build a pipeline, you need to answer a harder question: **what problem are you actually solving?**

That sounds obvious. It isn't. Most AI projects fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because the team never agreed on what the technology was supposed to do. They built a chatbot when they needed a search engine. They optimized for accuracy when the business cared about speed. They shipped a feature that solved a problem nobody had.

Problem framing is the translation layer between business intent and technical execution. It's where you take a vague goal like "improve customer support" and decompose it into specific, testable, buildable tasks — each with clear inputs, outputs, success criteria, and constraints. Get this right, and everything downstream — evaluation, ground truth, monitoring, iteration — falls into place. Get it wrong, and you'll spend months building the wrong thing well.

This section teaches you how to think about AI problems before you start solving them. How to break them apart. How to classify the pieces. How to define what success looks like for each piece. And how to package all of that into artifacts that your evaluation and ground truth teams can actually use.

## Why This Section Matters

Without problem framing, your team builds in the dark. Engineers guess at requirements. Product managers can't tell if the system is working. Evaluators don't know what to measure. Every decision downstream becomes an argument because nobody locked in the fundamentals.

With problem framing, you have a shared map. Everyone knows what tasks the system handles, what success looks like for each one, what the inputs and outputs are, and where the boundaries are. Disagreements surface early — when they're cheap to resolve — instead of late, when they're expensive.

This is the work that separates teams that ship confidently from teams that ship and pray.
