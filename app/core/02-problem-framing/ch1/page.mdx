# Chapter 1 — Why Problem Framing Is the Highest-Leverage Skill

Every failed AI project I've studied has one thing in common: the team started building before they finished thinking. They had a model picked out before they had a problem defined. They had prompts written before they had success criteria. They had a demo ready before anyone asked "what does this actually need to do in production?"

Problem framing is the most underleveraged skill in AI engineering. An hour spent on framing saves weeks of wasted development. A good framing document prevents the arguments, rework, and misaligned expectations that kill projects. And yet, most teams skip it entirely — or treat it as a five-minute exercise before diving into the "real work."

This chapter makes the case for taking framing seriously. It covers what framing is, what it costs to skip it, how it connects to everything downstream, and the artifacts and anti-patterns that separate teams who ship successfully from teams who ship sideways.
