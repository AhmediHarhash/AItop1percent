# 1.11 — Non-Goals: What We Are Not Solving

In mid-2025, a SaaS company launched an AI-powered email assistant. The framing document was thorough: it defined the tasks (drafting responses, summarizing threads, scheduling follow-ups), the success metrics (user engagement, time saved, satisfaction scores), and the constraints (latency under 2 seconds, cost under $0.05 per draft, GDPR compliance). The team shipped on schedule and the product worked as designed. Three months later, customer support was flooded with complaints: "Why does not the assistant handle attachments?" "Why can I not use it in languages other than English?" "Why does not it sync with my calendar automatically?" The framing document had never said the system **would** do these things, but it also never said it **would not**. The team spent the next six months explaining to angry customers why features they assumed were in scope were never planned. The product's reputation suffered, and adoption stalled.

The failure was not in what the team built. The failure was in what they failed to explicitly exclude. Non-goals are the most underrated section of any framing document. They are the boundaries that define what you are **not** solving, what you are **not** building, and what stakeholders should **not** expect. Without non-goals, every stakeholder will project their own assumptions onto your framing. Product will assume you are solving adjacent problems you never intended to solve. Users will expect features you never planned to build. Leadership will measure success against goals you never committed to. Non-goals prevent all of this.

This subchapter covers why non-goals are critical, how to write them effectively, and how to use them to set expectations and prevent scope creep.

## Why Non-Goals Matter: Preventing Scope Creep and Setting Expectations

Non-goals serve three essential functions in AI problem framing.

**First, they prevent scope creep.** Scope creep is the silent killer of AI projects. It happens when stakeholders gradually expand what the system is supposed to do without revisiting timelines, budgets, or resources. Someone says "while we are at it, can we also handle multilingual support?" Another person says "it would be great if this integrated with Salesforce." A third person says "users will expect real-time collaboration features." Before you know it, you are building three products instead of one. Non-goals cut this off at the source by making it explicit what is out of scope. When someone asks for a feature that is listed as a non-goal, you can point to the framing document and say "we explicitly decided not to do that in this version."

**Second, they set expectations.** Stakeholders and users will fill in gaps with their own assumptions. If your framing document says "we are building an AI support assistant," different people will imagine different things. Product might imagine a system that handles returns and refunds. Legal might imagine a system that avoids all compliance risk. Users might imagine a system that replaces human agents entirely. If you do not explicitly state what you are **not** doing, each stakeholder will discover their misalignment only after you ship — when it is too late to fix without major rework. Non-goals align expectations upfront.

**Third, they protect the team from blame.** When leadership or users complain that the system does not do something, and that something is clearly listed as a non-goal, you have documented evidence that it was never in scope. This sounds defensive, but it matters. Teams often get blamed for "missing features" that were never agreed to in the first place. Non-goals give you a paper trail that protects the team and clarifies accountability.

## How to Write Non-Goals: Explicit, Specific, Justified

The mistake most teams make with non-goals is writing vague statements like "we are not solving world hunger." That is useless. Non-goals must be **explicit** (clear enough that there is no room for interpretation), **specific** (tied to actual features or use cases someone might expect), and **justified** (with a reason why this is out of scope).

Here is the formula for writing effective non-goals:

**State what you are not doing.** Be direct. "This system will NOT handle billing disputes." "This system will NOT support languages other than English in v1." "This system will NOT replace human agents for Tier 4 escalations."

**Explain why.** Every non-goal should have a justification. This is critical because it shows that the exclusion was a deliberate decision, not an oversight. The justification usually falls into one of five categories: lack of required capability, lack of required data, out of scope for this version, regulatory or policy constraints, or dependency on external systems. For example: "This system will NOT handle billing disputes because billing disputes require access to payment records and account history, which this system does not have. Billing disputes will continue to be escalated to the finance team."

**Link to what you **are** doing.** The best non-goals clarify the boundary between in-scope and out-of-scope. For example: "This system WILL handle tier 1 and tier 2 support queries (account questions, password resets, basic troubleshooting). This system will NOT handle tier 3 and tier 4 escalations (technical deep dives, legal issues, executive escalations) because those require specialized expertise and access to internal tools."

**Be specific enough that stakeholders can tell if their use case is covered.** Avoid abstract non-goals like "we are not building a general-purpose assistant." Instead, write concrete non-goals like "we are not supporting integrations with third-party CRMs in v1" or "we are not providing voice input in v1."

Here are examples of well-written non-goals:

**Example 1: Language Support**

"This system will NOT support languages other than English in v1. Justification: Our ground truth dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and domain expert reviewers all cover English only. Adding multilingual support would require collecting training data in each language, hiring native-speaking evaluators, and validating that our models perform equally well across languages. This is a priority for v2 but is out of scope for the initial launch."

**Example 2: Integration Scope**

"This system will NOT integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, or other third-party CRMs in v1. Justification: CRM integrations require OAuth setup, API rate limit management, field mapping, and ongoing maintenance as CRM APIs change. We are prioritizing core functionality for v1. CRM integrations are planned for v2 after we validate product-market fit."

**Example 3: Escalation Handling**

"This system will NOT replace human agents for Tier 4 escalations. Justification: Tier 4 escalations involve legal disputes, executive complaints, and sensitive account issues that require human judgment and discretion. Regulatory requirements mandate human review for these cases. The system will detect Tier 4 cases and route them to human agents, but it will not attempt to resolve them autonomously."

**Example 4: Data Sources**

"This system will NOT use customer emails as a data source. Justification: Emails contain sensitive and proprietary information that customers have not consented to share for AI training. Using emails as a data source would violate our privacy policy and create GDPR compliance risk. The system will only use publicly available documentation and explicitly approved support transcripts."

**Example 5: Real-Time Requirements**

"This system will NOT provide real-time collaborative editing. Justification: Real-time collaboration requires WebSocket infrastructure, conflict resolution logic, and low-latency synchronization, which are not in scope for the MVP. Users will be able to share documents asynchronously via links, but simultaneous editing is deferred to v2."

Each of these non-goals is explicit (no ambiguity about what is excluded), specific (tied to a concrete feature or capability), and justified (explains why it is out of scope). If a stakeholder reads these and still expects the feature, that is on them — not on you.

## The Relationship Between Non-Goals and the "What We Are Solving" Section

Non-goals are not standalone — they are the **negative space** that defines the boundary of your solution. The "what we are solving" section tells stakeholders what the system does. The non-goals section tells them what it does not do. Together, these two sections define the full scope.

The test of a good framing document is this: can a stakeholder read the "what we are solving" and "non-goals" sections and accurately predict whether their use case is supported? If the answer is no, your framing is incomplete.

Here is an example of how these sections work together:

**What We Are Solving:**

"We are building an AI assistant that helps customer support agents respond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 queries. The assistant will suggest responses based on past support tickets, product documentation, and FAQs. It will support English-language queries and will integrate with Zendesk. Success is measured by reduction in response time, increase in agent productivity, and user satisfaction scores."

**Non-Goals:**

"This system will NOT handle Tier 3 or Tier 4 escalations (technical deep dives, legal disputes, executive escalations). These will continue to be handled by specialized teams.

This system will NOT support languages other than English in v1. Multilingual support is planned for v2 after we validate the English-only product.

This system will NOT replace human agents. The system is an assistant that provides suggestions, but agents have full control over whether to use, modify, or ignore those suggestions.

This system will NOT integrate with CRMs other than Zendesk in v1. Salesforce and HubSpot integrations are planned for v2.

This system will NOT use customer emails as a data source. It will only use support tickets, FAQs, and product documentation."

Notice how the non-goals clarify the boundaries of the "what we are solving" section. You now know exactly what types of queries are in scope, what language is supported, what role the AI plays, what integrations are included, and what data sources are used. There is no room for misinterpretation.

## Why Non-Goals Must Be Agreed by Stakeholders, Not Just Engineering

Non-goals are not a unilateral engineering decision. They are a **stakeholder agreement**. If engineering writes a list of non-goals and ships them without product, legal, and leadership approval, you have not actually scoped the project — you have just documented your assumptions. Those assumptions will be challenged the moment a stakeholder expects something different.

Non-goals must be reviewed and approved by the same stakeholders who approve the overall framing. This means:

**Product** must agree that the excluded features are not required for v1. If product expects multilingual support and you list it as a non-goal, you have a conflict that must be resolved before you proceed.

**Legal and compliance** must agree that the excluded capabilities do not create regulatory risk. If you say "we are not logging user queries" but legal requires audit logs for compliance, that non-goal is invalid.

**Leadership** must agree that the excluded scope aligns with strategic priorities. If leadership expects the system to replace human agents but you list that as a non-goal, you need escalation.

**Domain experts** must agree that the excluded tasks do not undermine the value of the system. If you say "we are not handling edge cases" but domain experts believe edge cases are the majority of the workload, your framing will fail.

The process for getting non-goal approval is the same as getting approval for the rest of the framing document: present them in a stakeholder alignment session, discuss concerns, and get explicit sign-off. If a stakeholder objects to a non-goal, you have three options: remove it from the non-goals list and add it to scope (which may require adjusting timelines or resources), justify why it must remain a non-goal (which requires data or policy backing), or escalate to leadership for a decision.

## How Non-Goals Evolve as the Product Matures

Non-goals are version-specific. What is a non-goal in v1 may become a goal in v2. What is out of scope for the MVP may be in scope for the enterprise tier. As your product matures, you revisit your non-goals and decide which ones to promote to goals.

Here is how the evolution typically works:

**MVP (v1)**: Aggressive non-goals. You exclude everything that is not critical to proving the core value proposition. Multilingual support, integrations, edge cases, advanced features — all out of scope. The goal is to ship fast and learn.

**V2**: Selective promotion. Based on user feedback and strategic priorities, you promote a few non-goals to goals. For example, if users are clamoring for multilingual support, that becomes a v2 goal. If enterprise customers need Salesforce integration, that becomes a v2 goal. You do not promote everything — only the highest-value items.

**V3 and beyond**: Continuous refinement. As the product scales, you keep revisiting non-goals. Some stay non-goals forever because they are out of scope for your product. Others get promoted as priorities shift.

The key is to **document the evolution**. When you promote a non-goal to a goal, update your framing document. When you keep something as a non-goal across multiple versions, document why. This creates a history of scope decisions that helps future teams understand the product direction.

## The Anti-Pattern: No Non-Goals Means Everything Is in Scope

The worst thing you can do is skip the non-goals section entirely. When a framing document has no non-goals, stakeholders assume that anything not explicitly excluded is implicitly included. This is a disaster.

Here is what happens: you ship v1. A user asks "why does not this support French?" You say "we never planned to support French." The user says "but you never said you would not support French, so I assumed you would." You say "it was not in the scope document." The user says "the scope document did not say it was out of scope either." You are now in a debate about what was "implied" by your framing, and you have no documentation to back up your position.

This same dynamic plays out with product, legal, leadership, and every other stakeholder. Without explicit non-goals, every stakeholder will invent their own version of what is out of scope, and those versions will conflict. You will spend months resolving misalignments that should have been caught during framing.

The fix is simple: always include a non-goals section. If you cannot think of any non-goals, you have not thought hard enough. Every project has boundaries. Document them.

## How to Use Non-Goals to Protect Against Scope Creep During Execution

Scope creep does not happen all at once. It happens gradually, one small request at a time. Someone asks "can we add a small feature?" You say yes because it seems harmless. Someone else asks "can we support one more use case?" You say yes because it is only one more. Six months later, you are building a system twice as complex as the one you framed, and your timelines have blown up.

Non-goals are your defense against this. When someone asks for a feature that is listed as a non-goal, you have three responses:

**"That is explicitly out of scope."** Point to the non-goals section. Remind them that this was agreed by stakeholders during framing. If they want to add it, they need to go through a formal scope change process, which means getting approval from product, engineering, and leadership, and adjusting timelines and resources.

**"Why is this suddenly a priority?"** If the feature was a non-goal and now someone is pushing to include it, ask what changed. Is there new data? New user feedback? A new strategic priority? If yes, that might justify a scope change. If no, it is just noise.

**"Let us defer to v2."** If the feature is valuable but not critical, agree that it belongs in the roadmap but not in the current scope. Add it to the v2 goals list. This acknowledges the request without derailing the current work.

Non-goals give you a documented basis for saying no. Without them, every request becomes a negotiation, and negotiations are exhausting and time-consuming.

## Practical Examples of Non-Goals from Real AI Systems

Here are non-goals from actual AI framing documents (anonymized):

**From a code generation assistant:**

"This system will NOT provide security vulnerability scanning. Justification: Security scanning requires specialized tooling (static analysis, dependency checks, penetration testing) that is outside the scope of code generation. We recommend users run dedicated security tools on generated code."

"This system will NOT generate infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation). Justification: Infrastructure code requires knowledge of cloud account configuration, networking topology, and security policies that the system does not have access to. Infrastructure code is deferred to v2."

**From a legal document review system:**

"This system will NOT provide legal advice. Justification: Providing legal advice requires a licensed attorney and creates liability under unauthorized practice of law statutes. This system is a document analysis tool, not a legal advisor."

"This system will NOT handle documents in languages other than English. Justification: Legal terminology is highly jurisdiction-specific, and our training data covers U.S. law only. Expanding to other languages or jurisdictions would require hiring legal experts for each region."

**From a healthcare diagnostics assistant:**

"This system will NOT provide diagnoses without physician review. Justification: Regulatory requirements under FDA guidelines mandate that AI-based diagnostic tools operate under physician supervision. This system is classified as a decision-support tool, not an autonomous diagnostic device."

"This system will NOT process pediatric cases in v1. Justification: Pediatric cases require specialized medical knowledge and have higher liability risk. Our initial ground truth dataset covers adult cases only. Pediatric support is planned for v2 after we collect sufficient pediatric training data and hire pediatric specialist reviewers."

**From an e-commerce recommendation system:**

"This system will NOT support real-time inventory updates. Justification: Real-time inventory sync requires integrating with warehouse management systems and handling distributed transaction consistency, which is outside the scope of the recommendation engine. Recommendations will be based on inventory snapshots updated every 15 minutes."

"This system will NOT provide personalized recommendations for users who have opted out of tracking. Justification: Personalized recommendations require user behavior data. For privacy-conscious users who opt out, we will show generic trending items instead."

Each of these non-goals is specific, justified, and protects the team from scope creep.

## Running a Non-Goals Review Session

When you draft your non-goals, run a dedicated review session with stakeholders. The agenda is simple:

1. Present the full list of non-goals.
2. For each non-goal, explain the justification.
3. Ask stakeholders: "Is anything on this list a blocker for v1?"
4. If yes, move it from non-goals to goals, and adjust scope or timelines accordingly.
5. Ask stakeholders: "Is there anything missing from this list that you expected to see?"
6. If yes, add it as a non-goal with justification, or escalate the conflict.

The goal is to surface misalignments **before** you start building. If product expects multilingual support and you have it listed as a non-goal, you need to know that now — not three months into development.

## Practical Takeaways

**Non-goals are not optional.** Every framing document must include a non-goals section. If you do not have one, stakeholders will invent their own assumptions, and you will pay for it later.

**Make non-goals explicit, specific, and justified.** Do not write vague statements. Write concrete features or capabilities that someone might expect, and explain why they are out of scope.

**Get stakeholder approval on non-goals.** Non-goals are a stakeholder agreement, not a unilateral engineering decision. If product, legal, or leadership disagrees with a non-goal, you have a conflict that must be resolved.

**Use non-goals to defend against scope creep.** When someone asks for a feature that is a non-goal, point to the framing document. If they want to add it, they need to go through a formal scope change process.

**Revisit non-goals as the product evolves.** What is a non-goal in v1 may become a goal in v2. Document the evolution so future teams understand the product direction.

**Run a dedicated non-goals review session.** Do not assume stakeholders read the non-goals section. Walk through it explicitly and confirm alignment.

With non-goals documented and agreed, you have defined the boundaries of your system: what it does, what it does not do, and why. The final piece of the framing puzzle is security. In 2026, threats are not an implementation detail — they are a framing concern. The next subchapter covers how to run a lightweight threat model during framing so your architecture has the hooks to defend against attacks before you write a single line of code.
