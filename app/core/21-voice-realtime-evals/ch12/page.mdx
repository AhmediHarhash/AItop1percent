# Chapter 12 — Enterprise Voice Operations: Compliance, Scale, and Governance

Enterprise voice AI operates under constraints consumer apps never face. Healthcare systems must comply with HIPAA while processing patient conversations in real time. Financial services voice agents must meet PCI-DSS requirements while handling payment information. Call recording laws vary by jurisdiction — what is legal in one state is a felony in another. Voice biometrics are regulated as biometric data in many regions, triggering consent frameworks and storage requirements that most teams discover only after deployment.

Then there is scale. Enterprise voice systems handle thousands of concurrent calls, route conversations across geographic regions for latency and compliance, manage multi-tenant architectures where one customer's voice data must never touch another's, and maintain disaster recovery plans for when entire data centers fail mid-call. They build handoff mechanisms from voice agents to human operators, audit logging for every interaction, and redaction pipelines for sensitive data in transcripts.

This chapter covers the operational reality of running enterprise voice AI at scale. It is not just about building a voice agent that works — it is about building one that is legal, compliant, auditable, and resilient when deployed across a regulated organization.

*The voice agent that works in the demo often fails in the enterprise — not because the AI is wrong, but because the compliance layer was never built.*
