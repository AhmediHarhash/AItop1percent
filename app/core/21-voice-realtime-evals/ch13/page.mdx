# Chapter 13 — Conversational Recovery Patterns

When a voice system fails mid-conversation, the user experiences it immediately. There is no retry button. No refresh. No graceful error page. The system went silent, or said something nonsensical, or asked the same question for the third time — and the user is still on the line, waiting, losing trust with every second of dead air.

Recovery in voice AI must happen within the same turn. If ASR misheard the user, you have 500 milliseconds to detect it, acknowledge the confusion, and ask for clarification. If the LLM times out, you need a filler response queued and a retry mechanism ready. If TTS fails, you need a fallback synthesis path or a pre-recorded apology. Recovery is not what you do after the call ends — it is what happens in the moment, while the conversation is still alive.

This chapter teaches the patterns that keep conversations from collapsing when components fail. It covers in-turn recovery, graceful degradation hierarchies, context preservation during retries, and the metrics that tell you whether your recovery mechanisms actually work.

*The best voice systems are not the ones that never fail — they are the ones that recover so smoothly you never notice the failure happened.*
