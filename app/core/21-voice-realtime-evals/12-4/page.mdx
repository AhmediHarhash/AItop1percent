# 12.4 — PCI-DSS and Financial Services Voice Requirements

Voice agents in financial services often handle payment card data. A customer calling to pay a bill dictates their card number. A banking voice agent verifies identity using account information. A retail voice agent processes transactions. When your voice AI handles primary account numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes, or cardholder names combined with card data, PCI-DSS applies. Compliance is not optional for organizations that process, store, or transmit cardholder data.

A regional credit union deployed a voice agent for account services in early 2025 that allowed members to pay bills by speaking credit card numbers. The system recorded full conversations including spoken card numbers, transcribed them, and stored transcripts in a database accessible to customer service representatives. The credit union treated the voice agent as equivalent to their web portal, which was PCI-DSS compliant, assuming compliance transferred automatically. During an annual PCI assessment, auditors discovered that voice recordings containing full card numbers were retained for 18 months, stored unencrypted in cloud object storage, and accessible to 47 employees without individual authentication. The assessment resulted in non-compliance findings, immediate suspension of card processing privileges by their acquiring bank, and a 90-day remediation period that cost 580,000 dollars in consultant fees, system redesign, and lost transaction volume.

The assumption that PCI compliance in one channel covers all channels is wrong. Each system that touches cardholder data requires separate compliance validation. Voice introduces unique challenges that web forms and point-of-sale terminals do not face.

## PCI-DSS Scope for Voice Systems

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version 4.0, current as of 2026, applies to all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Cardholder data includes the primary account number, cardholder name, expiration date, and service code. Sensitive authentication data includes the CVV, PIN, and full magnetic stripe data. Your voice agent is in scope if it handles any of this information.

Processing means receiving cardholder data even if you do not store it. If a user speaks their card number to your voice agent and the agent transmits it to a payment processor, you are processing cardholder data. The audio file containing the spoken number, the transcript containing the transcribed number, and any temporary memory or logs that capture the number all fall under PCI scope.

Storage means retaining cardholder data after authorization completes. If you record calls containing card numbers and keep the recordings, you are storing cardholder data. If you transcribe calls and the transcripts contain card numbers, you are storing cardholder data. PCI-DSS allows storage of primary account number, cardholder name, expiration date, and service code if business justification exists and proper security controls are implemented. But sensitive authentication data like CVV and PIN must never be stored after authorization, even encrypted.

Transmission means sending cardholder data across networks. If your voice agent receives audio containing a card number and transmits it to a backend service for processing, that transmission must be encrypted. If transcripts containing card numbers are sent to analytics platforms, that transmission must be encrypted. Unencrypted transmission of cardholder data violates PCI-DSS regardless of whether transmission occurs over the public internet or private networks.

Scoping determines which systems and processes require PCI controls. The cardholder data environment includes all system components that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, plus systems connected to or that could impact the CDE. For voice agents, scoping is complex. The audio capture component touches card data. The speech-to-text service touches card data. The intent classifier may touch card data if transcripts pass through it. The payment API definitely touches card data. The analytics platform might touch card data if transcripts containing card numbers are sent for analysis. Each component requires assessment.

Scope reduction is the primary strategy for manageable compliance. The fewer systems that touch cardholder data, the smaller the compliance burden. For voice agents, scope reduction means preventing card data from reaching most system components. The most effective approach: do not capture card data through voice at all.

## DTMF Capture Versus Voice Capture for Card Numbers

Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, the tones generated when a user presses phone keypad buttons, provides an alternative to voice capture for sensitive payment data. When a user enters their card number via keypad instead of speaking it, the audio channel does not contain cardholder data. The DTMF tones are processed separately from voice audio, allowing you to handle payment data through a PCI-compliant DTMF processing service while keeping the voice channel out of scope.

The architectural pattern is common in IVR systems and applies equally to voice AI. When payment information is needed, the voice agent instructs the user: "Please enter your sixteen-digit card number using your phone keypad. Do not speak the number." The user presses keys. The DTMF processor captures the tones, converts them to digits, and sends them to the payment processor. The voice channel continues handling conversational interaction, but never touches cardholder data.

This approach has major advantages for PCI scope. Your voice recording, transcription, and conversational AI components process no cardholder data and fall outside PCI scope. Only the DTMF processing component and payment API require PCI controls. The compliance burden is dramatically smaller. The technical complexity is manageable. Most telephony platforms support DTMF capture alongside voice.

The user experience trade-off is interaction mode switching. Users must shift from speaking to pressing keys, then back to speaking. For users comfortable with phone keypads, this is natural. For users who prefer pure voice interaction or who find keypad entry difficult, it creates friction. For visually impaired users who may have difficulty locating keys, it creates accessibility challenges.

A credit card issuer implemented hybrid voice and DTMF in late 2025 for their payment voice agent. Conversational interaction used voice. When payment information was needed, the agent said: "I can process your payment. Please use your phone keypad to enter your card number, then press pound. If you prefer to speak with a representative who can take your information, say representative." Approximately 89% of users successfully entered card numbers via DTMF. The remaining 11% either requested a representative or abandoned. PCI scope was reduced to the DTMF component and payment gateway, eliminating the voice platform, transcription service, and conversational AI from assessment.

The alternative to DTMF is voice-based card capture with strict controls to prevent storage and limit transmission. If you allow users to speak card numbers, you must ensure the audio containing card data and transcripts containing card data are never stored and are encrypted during transmission. This is technically achievable but operationally complex and expands PCI scope significantly.

## Cardholder Data Protection in Voice Interactions

If your architecture requires capturing card data through voice, PCI-DSS requirements apply end-to-end. Audio containing cardholder data must be encrypted in transit. Transcripts containing cardholder data must not be stored unless absolutely necessary, and if stored must be encrypted and access-controlled. Logs must not contain card numbers. Monitoring must detect unauthorized access.

Encryption in transit protects data during transmission. Audio streaming from user device to your voice agent must use TLS 1.2 or higher. The speech-to-text API call containing audio must use HTTPS with strong cipher suites. The payment API call containing transcribed card numbers must use TLS. Every hop in the data flow requires encryption. A single unencrypted link violates PCI-DSS.

Tokenization provides an alternative to encryption for long-term storage. When a user speaks a card number, immediately tokenize it. Replace the actual card number with a non-sensitive token that can be stored and referenced without PCI scope implications. The actual card number is stored by a PCI-compliant tokenization service. Your voice system stores only the token. When payment is needed, send the token to the payment processor who de-tokenizes it. This keeps your voice transcripts, databases, and logs out of PCI scope.

Truncation is acceptable for display purposes but does not remove data from PCI scope. Displaying only the last four digits of a card number to a user is fine. But if the full number exists anywhere in your system — audio, transcript, database, log — you are still storing cardholder data and PCI requirements apply. Truncation for display is a user experience feature, not a compliance strategy.

Access control limits who can access cardholder data. Every individual with access requires unique credentials. Shared accounts violate PCI-DSS. Access must be granted based on business need. A customer service representative who helps customers make payments needs access. A data scientist analyzing conversation patterns does not. Every access must be logged with user identity, timestamp, and data accessed. Logs must be retained and monitored for anomalies.

A payment processor offering voice-based bill pay implemented strict access controls in their 2025 PCI assessment. Only the payment processing service had access to full card numbers. Customer service representatives could see tokenized representations and last four digits, but not full numbers. Developers had access only to test data with synthetic card numbers. Data scientists worked with anonymized transcripts where card numbers were replaced with the token CARD_NUMBER. Access to production card data required VP approval and was logged to a tamper-evident audit system reviewed weekly by the security team.

## Recording Exclusions for Payment Data

PCI-DSS Requirement 3.2 prohibits storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization. CVV codes, PIN numbers, and full magnetic stripe data must never be stored, even encrypted. For voice systems, this creates a recording challenge. If you record calls for quality assurance or compliance purposes and users speak CVV codes, your recordings contain prohibited data.

The solution is selective recording or redaction. Pause recording when sensitive data is being collected. Resume recording after collection completes. Alternatively, record continuously but redact sensitive data from recordings before storage. Redaction must occur in real-time or near-real-time to minimize exposure window.

The implementation approach depends on interaction design. If you use DTMF for sensitive data, the voice channel never contains CVV or PIN, so recording can continue uninterrupted. If you collect sensitive data via voice, implement pause-and-resume recording or real-time redaction.

Pause-and-resume requires the voice agent to recognize when sensitive data collection is occurring. When the agent asks "What is the three-digit security code on the back of your card?", recording pauses. The user speaks the CVV. The agent processes it for authorization but does not record the audio or transcript. After authorization completes, recording resumes. The resulting recording has a gap during sensitive data collection, clearly marked to indicate why.

Real-time redaction processes audio and transcripts to remove sensitive data before storage. As the user speaks their CVV, the system transcribes it, uses it for authorization, then replaces it in the transcript with a placeholder like REDACTED or three asterisks. The audio is either deleted for that segment or has the spoken digits replaced with silence or tone. This approach allows continuous recording with compliant retention.

A telecommunications company providing voice payments implemented pause-and-resume in 2024. When their voice agent asked for CVV, recording stopped. A note in the transcript indicated: "Recording paused for security code collection." After authorization completed, the agent said "Thank you, your payment is processing" and recording resumed. Quality assurance reviewers saw complete conversations except for the brief CVV collection window. PCI auditors confirmed this approach satisfied the prohibition on storing sensitive authentication data.

The operational challenge is user behavior. If the agent asks for CVV and the user instead speaks their full card number again, the recording or redaction logic must adapt. Robust implementations use speech recognition to detect card numbers, CVVs, and other sensitive patterns regardless of when they occur, pausing or redacting dynamically. Simpler implementations rely on the agent controlling conversation flow to ensure sensitive data is requested only at expected moments.

## Audit Requirements for Financial Voice Systems

PCI-DSS requires comprehensive audit logging for all access to cardholder data. Every access by every user or system must be logged. Logs must include user identification, timestamp, type of event, success or failure, origination of event, and identity of affected data. Logs must be retained for at least one year with a minimum of three months immediately available for analysis.

For voice systems, audit logging covers access to recordings, transcripts, payment transactions, and system configurations. When a customer service supervisor plays a recorded call containing payment information, that access is logged. When a payment transaction is initiated through the voice agent, that event is logged. When a developer changes voice agent payment logic, that configuration change is logged.

Log protection is critical. Logs must be secured against unauthorized modification. Attackers who compromise a system often attempt to delete or alter logs to hide their activities. PCI-DSS requires protecting logs through access control, file integrity monitoring, and secure transmission to centralized log management systems. Writing logs to append-only storage prevents deletion. Cryptographic hashing detects tampering.

Log review is mandatory. Logs must be reviewed at least daily by personnel or automated tools to detect anomalous activity. An alert should fire if a user accesses an unusual number of recordings, if access occurs at unusual times, if failed authentication attempts spike, or if payment transaction patterns deviate from baselines. Automated monitoring scales better than manual review for high-volume systems.

A regional bank deployed automated log monitoring for their voice banking agent in 2025. The system analyzed access logs in real-time, comparing activity to learned baselines. When a customer service representative who normally accessed 10-15 recordings per day suddenly accessed 200 recordings in two hours, an alert fired. Investigation revealed the representative was collecting data for a class action lawsuit they planned to join. Access was immediately revoked and the incident was escalated. Without automated monitoring, the anomalous access would not have been detected until quarterly audit review.

Quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration tests are required for all systems in the cardholder data environment. If your voice agent is in scope, it must be scanned by an Approved Scanning Vendor and tested by a Qualified Security Assessor or internal team following PCI penetration testing requirements. Voice-specific tests should include attempting to extract card data from recordings, bypassing authentication to access transcripts, intercepting unencrypted transmission, and exploiting voice-specific vulnerabilities like voice injection attacks.

## Organizational and Governance Controls

PCI-DSS is not only technical. Organizational controls including policies, procedures, training, and vendor management form a critical compliance layer. Every employee with access to cardholder data must receive security awareness training. Policies must define acceptable use, access control, incident response, and vendor management. Vendors that handle cardholder data on your behalf must be assessed for PCI compliance.

Security awareness training for voice systems should cover recognizing cardholder data in transcripts, protecting recordings, detecting social engineering attacks, reporting security incidents, and understanding PCI requirements. Training must occur at hiring and annually thereafter. Completion must be documented. If an employee with access to voice recordings containing card data has not completed training, that is a compliance gap.

Vendor management ensures third parties meet PCI standards. If you use a cloud platform to host your voice agent, that vendor must provide PCI attestation. If you use a speech-to-text API that processes audio containing card data, that vendor must be PCI-compliant. If you use a payment gateway, they definitely must be compliant. You are accountable for your vendors' compliance, so due diligence is mandatory.

The PCI compliance responsibility matrix documents who is responsible for which requirements. In cloud environments, the cloud provider is responsible for physical security, infrastructure encryption, and network controls. You are responsible for application-level controls, access management, and data protection. The matrix must be documented to avoid gaps where each party assumes the other is handling a requirement.

A fintech company offering voice-activated payments learned this lesson in 2024. They hosted their voice agent on a major cloud platform and assumed PCI compliance was the platform's responsibility. During their first PCI assessment, auditors clarified that the cloud provider was responsible for infrastructure, but the company was responsible for application-level controls including access management, encryption of data at rest, and secure coding. The company had not implemented these controls, assuming cloud hosting provided them. Remediation took four months and delayed a planned product launch.

Incident response plans must address voice-specific scenarios. If a recording containing card data is inadvertently exposed, what is the response process? If a voice agent is compromised and attacker gains access to payment transactions, how is containment achieved? The plan must define detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. The plan must be tested annually through tabletop exercises or simulations.

## Compliance Validation and Attestation

PCI-DSS compliance is validated annually through self-assessment questionnaires for small merchants or formal assessments by Qualified Security Assessors for larger organizations and service providers. If your voice agent processes more than six million transactions annually or if you are a service provider, you likely require a formal Report on Compliance. Smaller volumes may qualify for self-assessment.

The Self-Assessment Questionnaire version appropriate to your environment depends on how you process card data. SAQ A applies if you outsource all cardholder data processing to PCI-compliant third parties and never touch card data yourself. SAQ A-EP applies if you use e-commerce with payment pages hosted by third parties. SAQ D applies if you do not fit other categories or if you are a service provider. Voice agents that capture card data likely fall under SAQ D, the most comprehensive assessment covering all PCI-DSS requirements.

Report on Compliance requires engagement with a QSA who validates your controls against all PCI-DSS requirements. The assessment includes interviews, documentation review, technical testing, and evidence collection. For voice systems, the QSA will examine your recording practices, encryption implementation, access controls, logging, network segmentation, and vendor management. The assessment concludes with a report documenting compliance status and any gaps requiring remediation.

Attestation of Compliance is the summary document provided to acquiring banks and payment brands confirming your compliance status. The AOC includes your organization's details, assessment scope, compliance validation method, and compliance status. You must provide the AOC to entities requesting evidence of compliance, typically your acquiring bank or payment processor.

Non-compliance has business consequences beyond security risk. Acquiring banks may terminate your merchant account if you fail assessments. Payment brands like Visa and Mastercard can levy fines for non-compliance. Data breaches at non-compliant merchants result in higher fines, forensic investigation costs, and card reissuance costs. The financial impact of non-compliance can exceed the cost of achieving compliance.

A subscription service offering voice-based payment processing operated for 18 months without completing PCI assessment, assuming their small transaction volume exempted them from requirements. When their acquiring bank implemented stricter compliance enforcement in mid-2025, the company was required to complete SAQ D within 60 days or lose their merchant account. They engaged a consultant, implemented required controls, and completed the assessment at a cost of 120,000 dollars. Had they designed for compliance from the beginning, incremental cost would have been under 30,000 dollars. Delayed compliance is more expensive than designed compliance.

## Designing Voice Payments for Compliance

The most effective path to PCI compliance is designing systems that minimize cardholder data exposure. Use DTMF for sensitive data capture. Tokenize immediately upon capture. Avoid storing audio or transcripts containing card data. Segment voice components so only payment-specific functions touch cardholder data. Outsource card processing to PCI-compliant service providers when possible.

The architectural principle is data minimization. Collect only the cardholder data you need. Do not store it longer than necessary. Do not transmit it to systems that do not need it. Do not log it. Do not include it in error messages or debug output. Every additional system that touches cardholder data expands PCI scope and increases compliance burden.

For most voice agents, the optimal design is DTMF-based card capture integrated with a PCI-compliant payment gateway. The voice conversation handles everything except payment data entry. When payment is needed, the agent instructs DTMF entry. The DTMF processor sends card data directly to the payment gateway. The voice agent receives a transaction result, not cardholder data. This design keeps voice components entirely out of PCI scope.

If business requirements mandate voice-based card capture, implement real-time tokenization. Transcribe the spoken card number. Immediately send it to a tokenization service. Receive a token. Store and process the token, never the actual card number. The token can appear in transcripts, databases, and logs without PCI scope implications. The card number exists only in transit and in the tokenization vault.

PCI compliance for voice AI is achievable through thoughtful architecture and rigorous operational controls. The organizations that succeed treat PCI as a design constraint from day one, minimize cardholder data exposure, segment systems to reduce scope, and maintain comprehensive audit evidence. Compliance is not a barrier to voice payments. It is the foundation of trustworthy voice payments that customers, banks, and regulators can rely on.

The compliance landscape for voice AI includes not only data protection regulations like GDPR and industry-specific rules like HIPAA and PCI-DSS, but also the foundational question of consent management across all these frameworks.
