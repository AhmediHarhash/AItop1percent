# Chapter 4 — ASR Evaluation: Measuring What the System Hears

Word Error Rate is the industry standard metric for automatic speech recognition. It measures the percentage of words the system transcribes incorrectly. A WER of five percent means the system misses or garbles one word out of every twenty. In 2026, commercial ASR providers advertise WERs in the single digits on standard benchmarks like LibriSpeech. But in production, on real customer audio, with real accents, real background noise, and real domain vocabulary, WER can be three times higher. The gap between benchmark performance and production performance is where voice AI systems fail.

This chapter teaches you how to evaluate ASR in the environment that matters — your environment. You will learn how to measure WER correctly, how to account for accents and noise and domain-specific terminology, and how to build evaluation datasets that reflect the audio your system actually receives. ASR is the first component in the voice pipeline. If it fails, everything downstream inherits the error. You cannot fix transcription mistakes with a better LLM. You can only prevent them with better ASR evaluation.

*ASR errors compound. A single missed word can derail the entire conversation. Evaluating ASR is not about benchmarks — it is about building datasets that match the audio your system will actually hear.*
