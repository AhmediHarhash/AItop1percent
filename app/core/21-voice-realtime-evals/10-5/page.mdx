# 10.5 — Cost-Based Provider Routing and Optimization

Your voice AI system routes every conversation to OpenAI's GPT-5.2 because it delivers the best quality. You're paying $0.12 per minute of conversation time. Meanwhile, your competitor routes 60% of conversations to a provider that charges $0.03 per minute and reserves the expensive model for complex queries. At 100,000 conversation-minutes per month, you're spending $12,000. They're spending $4,200 for statistically indistinguishable user satisfaction scores. The cost difference funds two additional engineers. The quality difference is invisible to users.

Cost-based routing is not about cutting corners. It is about recognizing that voice AI providers offer wildly different pricing for capabilities that often overlap, and that most conversations do not require the most expensive model on the market. When you route intelligently based on predicted complexity, user segment, and real-time utilization, you cut costs by 40 to 70 percent without degrading experience. When you route blindly to the cheapest option, you save 80 percent and lose 40 percent of your users to frustration within three months. The difference is measurement, routing logic, and the discipline to override cost optimization when quality demands it.

## The Voice Provider Pricing Landscape in 2026

Voice AI costs split into three components: STT, LLM inference, and TTS. Each component has different pricing models across providers. OpenAI charges per conversation minute with bundled pricing. Anthropic charges per input and output token for Claude Opus 4.5, requiring you to calculate expected conversation length. Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think uses a hybrid model: per-turn for simple queries, per-minute for extended conversations. ElevenLabs and PlayHT charge per character synthesized for TTS. Deepgram and AssemblyAI charge per audio minute for STT, with tiered pricing for real-time versus asynchronous transcription.

A typical five-minute customer support conversation costs between $0.08 and $0.60 depending on which providers you route to. The tenfold variance exists even when quality is comparable because pricing strategies differ. Some providers subsidize voice to gain market share. Some charge premium rates for guaranteed low latency. Some offer volume discounts that kick in at 500,000 minutes per month. The teams that treat all providers as interchangeable and always route to the cheapest option discover that cost and quality do not correlate linearly. The teams that treat voice as a single-vendor decision discover that they are overpaying for 70 percent of conversations that could run on a cheaper tier without user impact.

The complexity multiplies when you factor in real-time requirements. Low-latency STT from Deepgram costs 40 percent more than standard-latency transcription. Streaming TTS with sub-200ms first-byte latency costs twice as much as batch synthesis. If you route every conversation to the premium tier, you waste money on conversations where users tolerate slightly higher latency. If you route aggressively to cheaper tiers, you create noticeable lag on calls where users expect instant responsiveness. The right approach is dynamic routing based on conversation context, user history, and current system load.

## Per-Minute Pricing Models and What You Actually Pay

Most voice providers in 2026 have moved to per-minute pricing because it aligns with how users think about voice interactions. You start a call, you talk for six minutes, you hang up. Charging per token makes sense for text chat but feels opaque for voice. The shift to per-minute pricing simplifies budgeting but introduces new optimization challenges because the same conversation can cost different amounts depending on how much silence you transmit, how aggressively you interrupt, and how efficiently the LLM generates responses.

A provider charging $0.10 per minute is not actually charging for 60 seconds of audio. They are charging for the time between conversation start and conversation end, regardless of who is speaking. If your system takes three seconds to respond after the user finishes talking, those three seconds count toward your billable minutes. If the user pauses mid-sentence for four seconds, that counts too. If your system transmits silence while waiting for the LLM to generate the next sentence, you are paying for dead air. The teams that optimize per-minute costs aggressively trim silence, interrupt faster when detecting turn-taking cues, and batch TTS synthesis to avoid paying for generation latency.

Volume-based pricing tiers create optimization opportunities if you can commit to sustained usage. A provider might charge $0.12 per minute for the first 100,000 minutes per month, $0.09 for the next 400,000 minutes, and $0.06 for everything beyond 500,000 minutes. If you are consistently processing 300,000 minutes per month across two providers, consolidating to a single provider drops your per-minute cost by 25 percent. But consolidation also eliminates redundancy. The right trade-off depends on your uptime requirements and your confidence that the single provider will not have an outage during your peak traffic hours.

Prepaid commitment pricing offers the deepest discounts but requires accurate forecasting. You commit to one million conversation-minutes over six months at $0.05 per minute. If you use 800,000 minutes, you still pay for one million. If you use 1.2 million, you pay overage rates of $0.14 per minute. The commitment saves money only if your usage prediction is accurate within 10 percent. The teams that sign annual commitments based on optimistic growth projections end up paying for unused capacity. The teams that avoid commitments entirely overpay by 30 to 50 percent compared to competitors who forecast well.

## Cost Versus Quality Tiers: When Cheaper Providers Are Good Enough

Not all conversations require the same intelligence. A user calling to check account balance does not need GPT-5.2. A user calling to negotiate a complex contract amendment might. The challenge is detecting conversation complexity early enough to route to the appropriate tier before you waste money on overprovisioning or frustrate the user with underprovisioning. The teams that route based on predicted complexity cut costs by 50 percent. The teams that route randomly or uniformly leave money on the table or create quality gaps.

Intent classification at conversation start is the simplest routing heuristic. When the user says "I need to reset my password," you route to a cheaper provider running a fine-tuned Llama 4 Scout model optimized for procedural tasks. When the user says "I'm having trouble understanding why my claim was denied and I need to talk through my options," you route to GPT-5.2 or Claude Opus 4.5. Intent classification accuracy of 85 percent is sufficient if your fallback strategy is conservative: when uncertain, route to the higher tier. The cost of misrouting a complex query to a cheap model is user frustration and potential churn. The cost of misrouting a simple query to an expensive model is a few extra cents.

User segment routing adds a second dimension. Enterprise customers paying $500 per month get routed to premium providers by default. Free-tier users get routed to the cheapest provider that maintains acceptable quality. The moral and product implications are real: you are explicitly delivering different quality tiers to different users. Some companies are comfortable with this. Some view it as a competitive differentiator. Others view it as ethically problematic and route all users to the same tier regardless of payment status. There is no universal answer, but there is a universal cost: if you route all users to the premium tier, your voice AI infrastructure costs will be three to five times higher than a competitor who segments aggressively.

Historical performance routing uses past conversation data to predict future complexity. A user who has had three previous calls, all resolved in under two minutes with simple procedural guidance, gets routed to the cheaper tier. A user whose last call escalated to a human agent after ten minutes of back-and-forth gets routed to the premium tier. This approach requires conversation history storage and lookup, adding 20 to 40 milliseconds of latency before the call even starts. The latency cost is acceptable if routing accuracy improves by 15 percentage points. It is unacceptable if the improvement is only five percentage points because you have traded speed for marginal cost savings.

## Budget Allocation: How Much to Spend on Primary Versus Fallback

If you allocate 100 percent of your voice AI budget to your primary provider, you have no money left for fallback capacity. If you allocate 50 percent to primary and 50 percent to fallback, you are paying double for the same traffic because failover happens only during outages. The correct allocation is somewhere in between, determined by your uptime requirements, your traffic predictability, and your provider contract terms. The teams that optimize budget allocation save 20 to 30 percent compared to teams that overprovision failover capacity or underprovision and suffer outages.

The standard model is 80 percent of budget allocated to primary capacity and 20 percent to hot standby failover. This assumes your primary provider handles 95 percent of traffic under normal conditions and your fallback provider handles the remaining five percent plus any overflow during outages. The 80-20 split works when your primary provider has 99.9 percent uptime and your fallback provider charges similar per-minute rates. It breaks down when your primary provider has 99.5 percent uptime or your fallback provider charges double. If your primary provider goes down for 30 minutes twice a month, your fallback provider is suddenly handling 20 percent of monthly traffic, and your 20 percent budget allocation is exhausted halfway through the month.

Committed capacity contracts force you to prepay for minimum usage levels. If you commit to 500,000 minutes per month with your primary provider, you pay for 500,000 minutes whether you use them or not. If you also commit to 100,000 minutes per month with your fallback provider, you are paying for 600,000 minutes of capacity but only using 500,000 under normal conditions. The 100,000-minute fallback commitment makes sense if outages or traffic spikes push you over 500,000 minutes at least twice per quarter. It makes no sense if your traffic is stable and your primary provider never goes down. The teams that overcommit to fallback capacity pay for insurance they never use. The teams that undercommit face overage charges that are three times the committed rate when outages occur.

Spot pricing and on-demand tiers offer flexibility at a cost premium. You pay $0.06 per minute for committed capacity and $0.15 per minute for on-demand overflow. During normal operations, you route 100 percent of traffic to committed capacity. During an outage or traffic spike, you route overflow to on-demand. This model works when spikes are rare and short-lived. It fails when spikes become frequent because on-demand costs add up faster than committing to higher base capacity. A team experiencing weekly traffic spikes that push them into on-demand pricing for 50,000 minutes per month would save money by increasing their committed capacity by 50,000 minutes at the lower rate.

## Dynamic Cost Routing: Route to Cheaper Providers When Utilization Allows

Static routing rules send all simple queries to Provider A and all complex queries to Provider B. Dynamic routing continuously evaluates current system load, provider latency, and cost, then routes each conversation to the optimal provider in real time. A simple query that would normally go to the cheap provider gets routed to the expensive provider if the cheap provider is at 90 percent capacity and the expensive provider is at 40 percent capacity. The added cost is justified by avoiding queueing delays that would degrade user experience.

The routing decision happens at conversation start and requires real-time metrics from all providers. You need current request queue depth, average response latency over the last 60 seconds, and error rate over the last five minutes. If Provider A normally responds in 180 milliseconds but current latency is 420 milliseconds due to load, you route to Provider B even though it costs 40 percent more. The cost increase is temporary. The latency savings are immediate. The user never knows that you dynamically switched providers mid-day based on real-time performance data.

Dynamic routing requires a central orchestration layer that tracks provider health and cost. The orchestration layer receives every incoming conversation, evaluates current conditions, selects a provider, and forwards the request. The orchestration layer itself adds 10 to 30 milliseconds of latency depending on implementation. If your orchestration layer is poorly optimized, you add more latency than you save by routing around congested providers. The teams that build custom orchestration layers in Rust or Go keep overhead under 15 milliseconds. The teams that use heavy Python-based frameworks with multiple database lookups add 80 milliseconds and negate the benefit of dynamic routing.

Cost caps and budget guardrails prevent dynamic routing from runaway spending. You set a rule: if routing to the expensive provider would push today's spending above $1,500, route to the cheap provider regardless of load. This creates a trade-off: you protect your budget but accept degraded latency once you hit the cap. The alternative is allowing unlimited failover to expensive providers, which protects user experience but can double your monthly bill during an outage. The teams that set hard cost caps discover that user satisfaction drops sharply on days when they hit the cap by 2 PM and spend the rest of the day routing to overloaded cheap providers. The teams that set no caps discover budget overruns that require executive approval and emergency spending freezes.

## The Cost Cliff: When Aggressive Optimization Degrades Experience

Cost optimization has a floor. Below a certain spend level, quality collapses. The cost cliff is the point where cutting costs by another 10 percent causes user satisfaction to drop by 30 percent. The teams that optimize past the cliff save money in the short term and lose users in the medium term. The cliff location varies by use case, but the warning signs are universal: rising complaint rates, longer conversation times, increasing escalation to human agents, and dropping CSAT scores.

The first sign of crossing the cliff is rising repeat contact rate. Users call back the next day because the voice AI did not solve their problem the first time. Repeat contact rate above 15 percent indicates that your routing logic is sending too many conversations to undertrained or underpowered models. Each repeat contact costs you another conversation, doubling your effective cost per resolution. Aggressive cost optimization that cuts per-conversation cost by 30 percent but increases repeat contact rate from 10 percent to 25 percent actually increases total cost by 12 percent while degrading user experience.

The second sign is increasing conversation length. When users cannot get answers from the cheaper model, they spend more time rephrasing questions, repeating themselves, and expressing frustration. Average conversation length rising from four minutes to six minutes suggests that your cost-optimized routing is forcing users to work harder to extract value. The per-minute cost is lower, but the total cost per conversation is higher because conversations take 50 percent longer. You have optimized the wrong metric.

The third sign is escalation rate to human agents. If 8 percent of voice conversations escalate to a human agent under your previous routing strategy and 18 percent escalate under your cost-optimized strategy, you have shifted cost from AI to human labor. Human agent time costs $2 to $5 per minute depending on geography and expertise. If aggressive AI cost optimization increases escalation rate by 10 percentage points and each escalation costs $12 in human time, you are spending more overall while delivering a worse user experience. The teams that measure total cost of resolution across AI and human channels avoid this trap. The teams that measure only AI infrastructure cost fall into it.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Cost Routing Over Time

Cost-based routing is not a one-time configuration. Provider pricing changes quarterly. Model performance improves or degrades as providers update their systems. User expectations shift as competitors improve their voice AI experiences. The routing strategy that optimized cost in January delivers subpar experience in June if you do not continuously monitor and adjust. The teams that review routing performance weekly catch degradation early. The teams that review quarterly discover problems only after users have already churned.

The key metric is cost per successful resolution. You divide total voice AI spend by the number of conversations that resolved user issues without escalation or repeat contact. A routing strategy that costs $0.08 per conversation but resolves 75 percent of issues has a cost per resolution of $0.107. A routing strategy that costs $0.12 per conversation but resolves 92 percent of issues has a cost per resolution of $0.130. The 22 percent cost increase buys you a 23 percent improvement in resolution rate, making it a neutral trade-off on pure cost efficiency. The decision then comes down to user experience priorities and competitive positioning.

Segmented cost analysis reveals where optimization opportunities remain. Break down cost per resolution by intent category, user segment, time of day, and provider. You might discover that routing financial advice queries to the cheap provider saves $0.04 per conversation but reduces resolution rate by 35 percentage points, while routing password reset queries to the cheap provider saves $0.03 per conversation with no measurable quality impact. The optimization opportunity is obvious: route procedural queries aggressively to cheap providers, route advice queries conservatively to premium providers.

Provider performance benchmarking should happen monthly. Run the same 500-conversation test set through each provider and measure latency, quality, and cost. Provider A might have been the best value in January but Provider B launched a new pricing tier in March that undercuts them by 20 percent with equivalent quality. If you are still routing 80 percent of traffic to Provider A based on January's analysis, you are overspending by 16 percent. The teams that re-benchmark quarterly catch these opportunities. The teams that re-benchmark annually leave money on the table for nine months at a time.

Instant fallback patterns depend on being able to switch providers mid-conversation without the user noticing. That is the subject of the next subchapter.
