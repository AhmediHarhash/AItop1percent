# 10.9 — Provider Contract and SLA Management

In late 2025, a telehealth company ran a voice-based triage service handling 12,000 patient calls per day. Their provider suffered a four-hour outage during peak evening hours, affecting 1,800 calls. The company filed for SLA credits under their contract, expecting compensation for the disruption. They received $340 in account credits — roughly 0.4% of the monthly invoice. The contract guaranteed 99.9% uptime, which the provider met despite the outage. The four-hour window represented 5.5% of the month, well within the 0.1% allowable downtime. The company had assumed SLA guarantees meant protection against business impact. They learned that SLAs are insurance policies with deductibles — and most voice outages fall within the deductible.

The contract you sign before deploying voice infrastructure determines what happens when things break. Most teams treat contract negotiation as a procurement formality, focusing on unit pricing while glossing over SLA details. Then an outage happens. Calls fail. Customers complain. The team discovers that the provider owes them almost nothing, that latency degradation is not covered, that quality issues require proof the team cannot provide, and that switching providers mid-contract triggers penalties that dwarf any credits they might receive. Voice SLAs are not written to protect you — they are written to limit provider liability while creating the appearance of accountability.

## The Components of a Voice SLA

A comprehensive voice SLA covers five distinct dimensions: availability, latency, quality, throughput, and support responsiveness. Each dimension requires separate guarantees with separate measurement methodologies and separate credit structures. A contract that bundles these into a single uptime percentage is not protecting your system.

Availability is the easiest to define and the hardest to enforce. Providers typically guarantee 99.9% or 99.95% uptime measured monthly. The measurement is provider-side: if their infrastructure responds to API requests, the service is available, even if your application cannot reach it due to network issues, even if responses are too slow to be useful, even if quality has degraded to the point of unusability. Some contracts define availability as "the percentage of requests that receive a 200 status code within 30 seconds." A TTS request that takes 28 seconds to return garbled audio counts as available. Your production system, which needs audio in under 600ms, sees this as a failure. The SLA sees it as success.

Latency guarantees are rarer and more valuable. A meaningful latency SLA specifies percentiles and thresholds: "95th percentile ASR transcription latency will not exceed 400ms" or "99th percentile TTS first-byte time will not exceed 300ms." These guarantees apply only if you meet provider-defined conditions: your input audio must be under 10 seconds, your requests must not exceed a certain rate, your network path must use recommended routing. The moment your usage deviates from the idealized scenario, latency guarantees void. Most contracts do not include latency SLAs at all. When they do, they measure latency from when the provider receives the request to when they send the first response byte — excluding network transmission time, queueing delays at your edge, and processing time in your application. You experience end-to-end latency of 1.2 seconds. The provider measures 180ms. Both are correct.

Quality guarantees are almost nonexistent in 2026 voice contracts because quality is subjective and difficult to measure at scale. Some contracts promise "commercially reasonable quality" or "quality consistent with industry standards" — phrases that mean nothing in a dispute. A few enterprise contracts include specific quality metrics: ASR word error rate below 8% on clean audio, TTS mean opinion score above 4.0 as measured by provider testing. These guarantees come with escape clauses. If your audio includes background noise, accents, domain-specific terminology, or anything else that deviates from the test set, quality guarantees do not apply. The provider tested on studio-quality recordings of American English speakers reading scripted sentences. You are transcribing customer service calls with crosstalk, hold music, and regional dialects. The contract does not cover your use case.

Throughput guarantees define how many concurrent requests the provider will handle for your account. Standard contracts offer shared capacity with no guarantees — your requests compete with every other customer during peak load. Enterprise contracts may reserve capacity: "provider will support up to 500 concurrent TTS streams at contracted latency levels." This guarantee holds until a provider-wide incident affects all customers, at which point reserved capacity is treated as best-effort. During a major outage in November 2025, a provider reduced all customers to 20% of contracted capacity to keep the service operational. Customers with reserved capacity clauses were reduced alongside everyone else. The contract allowed this under a force majeure provision that included "events affecting the provider's infrastructure beyond reasonable control" — a category broad enough to include self-inflicted outages caused by botched deployments.

Support responsiveness SLAs define how quickly the provider will respond to incidents. Typical enterprise contracts guarantee response within one hour for critical issues, four hours for high-priority issues, and one business day for standard issues. Response means acknowledgment, not resolution. A provider can respond with "we are investigating" and satisfy the SLA even if the issue takes three days to resolve. Resolution time is almost never covered by SLA. The support SLA applies only if you file tickets through the designated channel, include all required diagnostic information, and classify the severity correctly according to provider definitions. Classify a P1 issue as P2 and the clock does not start until the provider reclassifies it — a process that can take hours.

## Credit Mechanisms and What They Actually Get You

SLA credits are the compensation providers owe when they violate SLA terms. Understanding how credits are calculated reveals how little protection most SLAs provide.

The standard credit structure is tiered by availability percentage. A contract guaranteeing 99.9% uptime might offer 10% account credit for availability between 99.0% and 99.9%, 25% credit for availability between 95.0% and 99.0%, and 50% credit for availability below 95.0%. These percentages apply to your monthly invoice for the affected service. If you spend $20,000 per month on ASR and the provider delivers 99.5% availability, you receive a $2,000 credit. This sounds meaningful until you calculate the business impact. If the 0.5% downtime occurred during your peak traffic hours and caused 3% of your customers to abandon calls, the revenue impact might be $80,000. The credit covers 2.5% of your actual loss.

Credits are capped. Most contracts cap total credits at one month's service fees. If a provider suffers catastrophic failures for three consecutive months, delivering 95% availability each month, they owe you 25% credit for each month — but the cap limits you to 100% of one month's fee across the quarter. You paid for three months of service, received nine days of outages, and your maximum compensation is one month's fees. The math does not add up in your favor.

Credits are not automatic. You must request them by filing a claim within a specified window — typically 30 to 60 days after the billing period ends. The claim must include evidence: timestamps of failed requests, logs showing error rates, screenshots of monitoring dashboards. The provider reviews the claim, often disputing your characterization of the outage. They may argue that the failures were caused by issues on your side — network problems, misconfigured requests, rate limiting triggered by your traffic patterns. The dispute process takes weeks. Many teams never file claims because the administrative burden exceeds the credit value.

Credits are applied as account credits, not refunds. You do not get money back. You get a discount on future invoices. If you decide to leave the provider after a bad month, you forfeit the credits. This creates an incentive to stay even after a major incident — you have already paid for next month via credited balance.

A financial services company experienced repeated ASR quality degradations in early 2026. Transcripts were missing words, hallucinating phrases, and requiring expensive human review to correct. They filed quality complaints under their enterprise contract. The provider responded that quality SLAs applied only to "clean, clear audio as defined in Appendix C." Appendix C specified audio recorded in studio conditions with no background noise, no overlapping speech, and no accents. The company's audio came from customer phone calls — inherently noisy, often containing crosstalk, and featuring every regional accent in North America. The provider argued that quality degradation on real-world audio was not an SLA violation. The contract agreed. The company received no credits despite spending $14,000 on human correction of bad transcripts that month.

## Penalty Clauses and Negotiating Leverage

Enterprise voice contracts sometimes include penalty clauses that extend beyond credits: commitments to fixed response times, dedicated support escalation paths, or even financial penalties for repeated violations. These clauses are negotiable but only if you have leverage.

Leverage comes from scale, commitment, or competition. If you are committing to $500,000 in annual spend, the provider will negotiate terms. If you are piloting with $5,000 per month, you get the standard contract. If you have a competing offer from another provider with better SLA terms, you can negotiate upward. If you are captive to a single provider because of technical requirements, you negotiate from weakness.

The most valuable penalty clause is the termination right: if the provider fails to meet SLA commitments for two consecutive months, you can terminate the contract without penalty. Standard contracts lock you in for one to three years with early termination fees equal to the remaining contract value. A termination right removes the lock-in, giving you an exit if service degrades. Providers resist this clause because it shifts risk to them. You will get it only if your scale matters or if the provider is hungry for the deal.

Some enterprise contracts include uptime commitments with financial penalties beyond credits. If availability falls below 99.5% for two consecutive months, the provider pays a penalty equal to 50% of the affected months' fees — actual payment, not credits. This is rare and expensive to negotiate, but it aligns incentives. The provider now has a financial reason to prioritize your reliability, not just a PR reason.

You can negotiate custom SLA terms if the standard terms do not fit your use case. A customer service voice application might care more about latency during business hours than overall uptime. You can negotiate a tiered SLA: 99.95% availability and 300ms P95 latency from 9 AM to 6 PM EST, 99.5% and 500ms outside those hours. The provider charges more for this because they must reserve capacity for your peak windows, but the SLA now matches your actual risk.

Negotiating annual minimums versus pay-as-you-go changes the leverage dynamic. If you commit to $1 million annually regardless of usage, the provider is incentivized to keep you happy — your revenue is guaranteed. If you pay only for what you use, the provider has less reason to prioritize your escalations. Committed spend buys better SLA terms, dedicated support, and faster response to incidents. The tradeoff is risk: if your usage drops, you still owe the minimum.

## Multi-Provider Contracts and Coordination

When you run multiple providers in a failover architecture, you need SLAs from each provider — and those SLAs must be compatible.

The first coordination issue is credit eligibility. If your primary provider fails and traffic shifts to your secondary, do you owe the secondary provider for the surge capacity? Some contracts charge overage fees if you exceed baseline traffic by more than 50% in a given hour. A failover event can trigger overage charges on the secondary while you are filing SLA claims against the primary. You end up paying more during outages than during normal operations.

Enterprise contracts can include failover clauses that waive overage fees during documented outages at another provider. You provide evidence that Provider A was down, and Provider B agrees not to charge surge fees for the traffic spike. Negotiating this requires advance disclosure that you run a multi-provider architecture — which some providers resist because it signals that you do not fully trust them.

The second coordination issue is SLA measurement windows. Provider A measures availability on a monthly basis. Provider B measures on a weekly basis. An outage in the first week of the month might trigger SLA credits from Provider B but not Provider A, depending on how the rest of the month goes. You cannot compare SLAs directly unless measurement windows align.

The third issue is support escalation during multi-provider incidents. If both providers are degraded simultaneously — a rare but catastrophic scenario — which support team do you escalate to? If you are running a merged orchestration layer, diagnosing which provider caused a failure requires detailed request tracing. Support teams from both providers may blame each other, each insisting the other is the root cause. Your contract should define an escalation protocol: if both providers are implicated, both must join a joint incident call. Few contracts specify this. Most assume single-provider failures.

A logistics company ran ASR and TTS from separate providers under separate contracts. ASR was billed monthly, TTS was billed weekly. An ASR outage in week one triggered TTS failover to a backup provider with overage fees. The primary ASR provider restored service by week two, meeting their 99.9% monthly SLA with no credits owed. The TTS provider charged 40% overage fees for week one due to the surge. The backup TTS provider charged setup fees for the emergency onboarding. The company paid more in week one than in a typical month and received no SLA compensation. The contracts did not account for cross-provider failure modes.

## Exit Clauses and Portability Guarantees

Exit clauses define how you leave a provider, what data you take with you, and what penalties you pay for early termination. Most teams do not read exit clauses until they want to leave — by which point it is too late to negotiate.

The standard contract includes early termination fees equal to the remaining committed spend. If you signed a two-year contract committing to $50,000 per month and you terminate after eight months, you owe $800,000 — the remaining sixteen months. This fee is negotiable at signing time but almost never waived after the fact. Some contracts include a step-down: 100% of remaining fees if you terminate in year one, 50% if you terminate in year two. This reduces risk but does not eliminate it.

Portability guarantees define what data you can take with you when you leave. For voice systems, portability covers training data, custom models, and request logs. Standard contracts allow you to export request metadata but not the underlying audio. If you fed 100,000 hours of labeled call recordings to train a custom ASR model, the provider may retain ownership of the model and the training data. You leave with nothing. Enterprise contracts can include data portability clauses: upon termination, the provider will deliver all training data, model weights, and request logs in a standard format within 30 days. This is not automatic. You must negotiate it upfront.

Some providers offer custom voice models as part of enterprise contracts — a TTS voice cloned from your recordings, an ASR model fine-tuned on your domain terminology. Ownership of these custom models is negotiable. The default contract gives the provider ownership: they created the model using their infrastructure, and you were licensing it. If you leave, you lose the custom voice. An improved contract grants you ownership: the provider trains the model as a service, and you own the output. You can take the model weights with you or license them to another provider. Providers resist this because it enables you to leave. You will get it only if you have leverage.

Exit notice periods range from 30 to 90 days. If you want to terminate, you must notify the provider 60 days in advance. During those 60 days, you continue paying, and the provider continues delivering service — but you are publicly shopping for alternatives, which changes the support dynamic. Some providers deprioritize accounts with pending terminations. Your feature requests are ignored. Your escalations are slow-walked. The relationship ends poorly, and if you ever need to return, you are not welcome.

A media company built a voice application using a provider's custom TTS voice trained on their brand spokesperson's recordings. The contract did not specify voice ownership. After two years, the company wanted to switch providers due to cost. The original provider claimed ownership of the voice model and refused to provide model weights. The company could not take the voice with them. Retraining the voice with a new provider required new recordings, new legal agreements with the spokesperson, and three months of work. The exit process took six months and cost $120,000 — far more than the annual savings from switching. The company stayed with the original provider. They were locked in without realizing it until they tried to leave.

## Negotiating Enterprise Voice Contracts

Contract negotiation for voice differs from negotiating standard API contracts because voice systems operate at scale with strict latency and quality requirements. Your leverage depends on how much you will spend, how visible your use case is, and whether you have alternatives.

Start negotiation by defining your requirements as measurable SLA terms. Instead of asking for "good uptime," specify "99.95% availability measured monthly with 10% account credit per 0.1% below threshold, credited automatically." Instead of requesting "low latency," specify "P95 ASR latency below 400ms and P99 TTS first-byte time below 300ms, measured server-side, with 5% credit per 50ms exceedance." Specific requests are harder to refuse than vague ones.

Negotiate volume commitments with step-downs. Commit to $500,000 annually but structure it as $30,000 per month for the first six months, $45,000 per month for the next six months, and $55,000 per month thereafter. This protects you if usage ramps slower than expected while giving the provider confidence in long-term revenue. Flat commitments are risky — if your product does not launch, you still owe the full amount.

Negotiate penalty-free offramps tied to SLA violations. If the provider fails to meet 99.9% availability for two consecutive months, you can terminate without fees. This clause costs the provider nothing if they deliver on SLAs and protects you if they do not. It is easier to negotiate than blanket termination rights.

Negotiate data ownership and portability upfront. Specify that all training data you provide remains your property, that custom models trained on your data are jointly owned with transferable licenses, and that upon termination the provider will deliver all data and models in documented formats within 30 days. This costs the provider little but saves you months of legal work if you leave.

Negotiate support escalation paths with named contacts. Enterprise contracts should include a designated technical account manager and a direct escalation path to engineering during incidents. The standard support queue is too slow for production voice outages. You need a phone number that reaches someone empowered to pull engineers into a call within 30 minutes. This is standard for contracts above $500,000 annually.

A healthcare voice application negotiated an enterprise contract with the following terms: 99.95% availability with 15% monthly credit per 0.1% below threshold, P95 latency below 350ms with 10% credit per 100ms exceedance, early termination allowed without penalty if SLA violations occur for two consecutive months, all training data and custom models owned by the customer with portability guaranteed, and a dedicated account manager with 30-minute P1 escalation response. The contract cost 18% more than the standard pricing, but the company considered the premium worthwhile for the risk reduction. Over 18 months, they filed two SLA claims totaling $11,000 in credits and never had to use the termination clause. The contract worked as intended — it aligned provider incentives with customer needs.

## What SLAs Do Not Cover

Understanding what SLAs omit is as important as understanding what they include. Most voice outages fall outside SLA coverage due to exclusions, definitions, and measurement methodology.

SLAs typically exclude incidents caused by "customer actions." If you deploy a code change that sends malformed requests, triggering errors at the provider, the provider is not liable. If you exceed rate limits due to a traffic spike, the resulting failures do not count against availability. If your network path to the provider degrades due to ISP issues, the latency increase is not covered. These exclusions are reasonable from the provider's perspective but shift responsibility for multi-component failures. In practice, determining whether an incident was caused by the provider or the customer often requires forensic analysis that takes days. By the time you prove it was not your fault, the SLA claim window may have closed.

SLAs exclude beta and preview features. If you use a provider's new neural TTS voice still marked as beta, quality and availability guarantees do not apply. Providers release features as beta to gather production usage data without SLA liability. Some features stay in beta for months. Your production application depends on a beta API, and the provider changes it without notice. No SLA violation occurred.

SLAs exclude incidents during maintenance windows. Providers reserve the right to take services offline for planned maintenance, typically with 48 hours notice. Maintenance windows are often scheduled during low-traffic periods — but "low traffic" is relative. A global voice application has no low-traffic period. When the provider schedules maintenance at 2 AM Pacific, that is 11 AM in Europe and 5 PM in Asia. The maintenance affects your users, but it does not count as downtime because it was planned.

SLAs do not cover partial degradations that stay within thresholds. If latency increases from 200ms to 600ms but your SLA threshold is 800ms, no violation occurred. If availability drops from 99.98% to 99.92% but your SLA guarantees only 99.9%, no violation occurred. Your users experience slower responses and more failures, but the provider met their contractual obligation.

SLAs do not cover quality degradation unless quality is explicitly defined in measurable terms. If ASR accuracy drops from 94% to 88% due to a model regression, and your contract has no quality metrics, you have no recourse. If TTS voices start sounding robotic after a provider updates their synthesis engine, and the contract specifies no quality floor, the provider owes you nothing.

The contract is a floor, not a target. Providers aim to exceed SLAs by a margin because operating right at the SLA threshold means frequent violations. But when something goes wrong, the contract defines the minimum they must deliver, not the level of service you actually need. The gap between "meets SLA" and "works for our use case" is where most production pain lives.

The SLA you negotiate today defines what options you have during the outage you will inevitably experience. Teams that treat contracts as boilerplate discover this the hard way — during an incident, when it is too late to renegotiate. The next subchapter covers the vendor lock-in risk that deepens with every integration you build on top of a provider's APIs.
