# Chapter 5 — TTS Quality: Making the System Sound Human

Text-to-speech quality in 2026 is no longer about intelligibility. Every commercial TTS provider can produce speech that is perfectly understandable. The competition is about naturalness — how human the voice sounds, how well it conveys emotion, how consistently it maintains identity across turns, and how it handles the small details that separate a good voice from a voice that users trust and prefer. TTS is the last component in the pipeline, but it is often the first thing users judge. A monotone voice makes the system feel robotic no matter how intelligent the underlying model is.

This chapter teaches you how to evaluate TTS for the qualities that matter in production. Mean Opinion Score is the gold standard, but running MOS studies is expensive and slow. You need faster proxies that correlate with human judgment. You need to measure prosody, emotional range, pronunciation accuracy, and cross-turn consistency. And you need evaluation frameworks that work at scale, because A/B testing TTS providers on real traffic is the only way to know which voice your users prefer.

TTS is where your system's personality lives. Evaluating it correctly is not optional.

*The voice users hear is the personality they judge. TTS quality is not a technical detail — it is the user experience layer of your entire system.*
