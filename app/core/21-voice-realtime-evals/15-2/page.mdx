# 15.2 — Per-Minute vs Per-Turn Pricing Models

How you are billed changes what you optimize for. A voice AI platform on per-minute pricing optimizes for call duration. Every second you shave off the average call length saves money. A platform on per-turn pricing optimizes for conversation efficiency. Every question you answer in one turn instead of three saves money. The pricing model is not just an accounting detail. It shapes your product design, your cost structure, and where your waste accumulates. Get the model wrong for your use case and you pay a margin tax every month. Get it right and you unlock cost advantages your competitors cannot match.

## The Per-Minute Model: Telephony Economics

Per-minute pricing comes from the telephony world, where calls are billed by duration. You connect, the meter starts, you disconnect, the meter stops. Everything in between is billable. This model makes sense for traditional phone systems because the cost to the provider is connection time — trunk lines, switching infrastructure, bandwidth. The longer the call, the more resources consumed.

Voice AI providers inherited this model because many of them bolt AI onto existing telephony infrastructure. Twilio, Vonage, and similar platforms charge per minute because their underlying costs are per minute. When you add ASR, LLM, and TTS to a phone call, the per-minute rate increases, but the structure stays the same. A typical per-minute voice AI provider in 2026 charges between $0.08 and $0.18 per minute, depending on component quality and volume tiers.

The advantage of per-minute pricing is predictability at the call level. A two-minute call costs twice what a one-minute call costs. You can estimate your monthly bill by projecting call volume and average call duration. If you expect 50,000 calls averaging ninety seconds each, that is 75,000 minutes. At $0.12 per minute, you budget $9,000. Simple.

The disadvantage is that per-minute pricing penalizes silence, slow processing, and thoughtful conversation. If your user pauses for five seconds to gather their thoughts, you pay for those five seconds. If your LLM takes four seconds to generate a response, you pay for that processing time. If your system plays hold music while retrieving data from an external API, you pay for the hold music. The clock never stops. Every second of connection time hits the meter, whether productive or not.

## The Per-Turn Model: API Economics

Per-turn pricing charges you per interaction, not per second. The user says something. Your system responds. That is one turn. One charge. The turn might last three seconds or thirty seconds — the price is the same. This model comes from API-first providers who think of voice AI as a request-response system, not a phone call.

OpenAI's Realtime API, introduced in late 2024 and widely adopted by 2026, uses per-turn pricing with token-based metering. You pay for input audio tokens and output audio tokens, plus any LLM tokens generated during the turn. A short question with a short answer might cost $0.008. A long question with a complex answer might cost $0.045. The cost varies with complexity, not duration.

The advantage of per-turn pricing is that silence is free. If your user pauses for ten seconds between turns, you do not pay for that pause. The meter only runs during active turns. This rewards systems that encourage efficient, turn-based interaction. If you can answer a question in one turn instead of dragging it across three clarifying exchanges, you save money.

The disadvantage is unpredictability. A conversation that should cost $0.10 based on expected turn count can suddenly cost $0.50 if the user asks a complex question that generates a long response. You do not know your cost until the turn completes. This makes budgeting harder. You cannot estimate monthly costs by call volume alone. You need to estimate turn count per call and average cost per turn, both of which vary significantly by use case.

## Hybrid Pricing: When Providers Blend Models

Some providers use hybrid pricing. You pay per minute for connection time, but you also pay per token for LLM usage. Or you pay a flat rate per turn up to a certain duration, then per-second beyond that. Or you pay per minute for ASR and TTS, but per token for the LLM in between. These hybrid models are attempts to balance predictability and fairness, but they introduce complexity.

A customer support voice agent in mid-2025 used a hybrid provider that charged $0.05 per minute for ASR and TTS, plus standard token pricing for the LLM. A typical ninety-second call cost $0.075 in ASR/TTS, plus roughly $0.006 in LLM tokens. Total cost: $0.081. That was cheaper than a pure per-minute provider charging $0.12 per minute, which would have billed $0.18 for the same call. The hybrid model saved them fifty-five percent per call.

But the savings disappeared when calls got complicated. A call involving a product return required the LLM to retrieve order history, check return eligibility, calculate refund amounts, and generate a confirmation email. The LLM token usage spiked from 800 tokens to 4,200 tokens. The ASR/TTS cost stayed at $0.075, but the LLM cost jumped to $0.032. Total cost: $0.107. A pure per-minute provider would have charged the same $0.18 regardless of complexity. The hybrid model saved money on simple calls but cost nearly the same on complex calls. The team had to segment their traffic by complexity to predict costs accurately.

## Choosing the Right Model for Your Use Case

The pricing model you choose should match your conversation pattern. If your calls are short and simple — order status checks, appointment confirmations, quick FAQs — per-turn pricing is almost always cheaper. You pay once per interaction, and each interaction is brief. A voice assistant confirming a delivery time might complete the entire conversation in two turns. At $0.01 per turn, that is $0.02. A per-minute provider charging $0.10 per minute would bill $0.05 for a thirty-second call. Per-turn wins.

If your calls are long and complex — therapy sessions, financial planning, technical support — per-minute pricing is often cheaper, especially if the provider offers volume discounts. A twenty-minute therapy session might involve forty turns. At $0.015 per turn, that is $0.60. A per-minute provider charging $0.12 per minute would bill $2.40. Per-turn wins again. But if the per-minute provider offers a volume discount at 100,000 minutes that drops the rate to $0.08 per minute, the same call costs $1.60. Still more expensive than per-turn, but closer. And if your LLM token usage is high because the therapy session generates long, nuanced responses, the per-turn token costs might push the total above $1.60. Suddenly per-minute is competitive.

The real decision point is predictability versus optimization. Per-minute pricing gives you predictable costs if your call durations are consistent. Per-turn pricing gives you optimized costs if your turn complexity is consistent. Hybrid models give you neither — but they can offer the best of both if your traffic is mixed.

## Negotiating Pricing With Providers

Most voice AI providers publish standard rates, but almost no one pays standard rates at scale. Once you cross 50,000 minutes per month or 100,000 turns per month, you have leverage to negotiate. And the pricing model itself is negotiable, not just the rate.

A legal intake voice assistant in early 2026 was using a per-minute provider at $0.14 per minute. They were processing 120,000 minutes monthly, paying $16,800. They asked their provider for a volume discount. The provider offered $0.11 per minute at 150,000 minutes per month, which would drop their bill to $16,500 once they hit that threshold. A small saving, but not meaningful.

Instead, they proposed a hybrid model: $0.06 per minute for ASR and TTS, plus standard token rates for the LLM, plus a committed spend of $15,000 per month. The provider accepted. The team's average call was three minutes. Under the old model, that cost $0.42. Under the hybrid model, ASR/TTS cost $0.18, LLM tokens cost roughly $0.012, total $0.192. They cut their per-call cost by fifty-four percent. The committed spend locked them in, but they were already exceeding that spend every month. The negotiation saved them $8,200 monthly — nearly $100,000 annually.

The key was reframing the ask. Instead of requesting a rate discount within the existing structure, they proposed a different structure entirely. Providers are often flexible on structure if it de-risks their revenue. A committed spend guarantee makes your contract more valuable to them. In exchange, they will often move off their standard pricing model.

## The Hidden Variable: Minimum Billing Increments

Pricing models have minimum billing increments that create waste at the edges. A per-minute provider might bill in six-second increments. A seven-second interaction gets billed as twelve seconds. A per-turn provider might bill input and output audio in half-second increments. A 1.2-second output gets billed as 1.5 seconds.

These increments seem small, but they compound. A voice assistant handling appointment reminders averages twelve seconds per call. If the provider bills in six-second increments, you pay for twelve seconds — no waste. But if the provider bills in thirty-second increments, you pay for thirty seconds. You are overpaying by 150 percent on every call. Across 200,000 calls per month, that is the difference between 40,000 minutes and 100,000 minutes billed. At $0.10 per minute, that is $4,000 versus $10,000. The increment structure costs you $6,000 monthly.

Always ask about billing increments during contract negotiation. Per-second billing is ideal. Six-second increments are acceptable. Thirty-second increments are punitive unless your average call length is above sixty seconds. If your provider insists on thirty-second increments, negotiate a lower per-minute rate to offset the waste.

## When Free Tiers and Credits Distort Reality

Most voice AI providers offer free tiers or signup credits. These are useful for prototyping, but they hide the true cost structure until you scale. A startup in late 2025 built their voice assistant on a provider offering $500 in free credits. They used those credits over three months while developing the product. Their usage was light — maybe 2,000 minutes monthly. The credits covered everything.

When they launched publicly, usage jumped to 35,000 minutes in the first month. The credits ran out in week one. They got their first invoice: $4,200. They had budgeted $1,500 based on their prototype costs. The per-minute rate had seemed reasonable during development, but they had not modeled the cost at scale. They had also not realized that the free tier included a discounted rate. Once the credits expired, the rate increased from $0.08 per minute to $0.12 per minute. The billing model had not changed. The price had.

Free tiers are not pricing models. They are marketing. Never project production costs based on free-tier usage. Always get a quote for your expected production volume at paid rates before you launch. And always simulate a cost spike — what happens if your traffic doubles overnight? Can you afford the bill, or does it break your budget?

## The Cost Model You Choose Shapes Your Product

If you are on per-minute pricing, you will design your product to minimize call duration. You will interrupt users less. You will optimize for fast ASR and fast LLM response times. You will discourage open-ended conversation. You will add features like "press 1 to hear this again" instead of letting the user ask naturally, because a DTMF tone is free and a voice question costs ASR time.

If you are on per-turn pricing, you will design your product to minimize turn count. You will encourage users to ask complete questions instead of incremental ones. You will optimize for one-shot answers. You will add summarization so the LLM can answer in fewer tokens. You will avoid clarifying questions, because every extra turn costs money.

Neither approach is wrong. But they are different. And if your pricing model and your product design are misaligned, you pay for the mismatch. A voice assistant designed for rich, multi-turn conversation will bleed money on a per-turn pricing model. A voice assistant designed for quick, transactional exchanges will waste money on a per-minute model if users hang around after the transaction completes.

The pricing model is not a back-office detail. It is a product constraint. Treat it like one. Understand your model, design for it, and renegotiate it when your usage pattern changes.

The next cost trap is silence. In per-minute pricing, silence is expensive. You are paying for dead air, hold time, and user pauses. Understanding how much silence you are paying for — and how to reduce it — is the difference between sustainable margins and runaway bills.
