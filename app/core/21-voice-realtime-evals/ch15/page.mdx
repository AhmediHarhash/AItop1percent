# Chapter 15 — Real-Time Cost Governance

Voice AI burns money faster than text. A single phone call can trigger ASR for every spoken second, LLM inference for every turn, TTS synthesis for every response, and provider fallback chains when components fail. Per-minute pricing means silence costs money. Token burst amplification means a long-winded LLM response can spike costs mid-call. Fallback storms — when primary providers fail and every retry hits backup services — can multiply spend by five in under a minute.

The cost model for streaming voice systems is fundamentally different from batch or text-based AI. There is no request queue you can throttle. No batch job you can delay until off-peak hours. Conversations happen in real time, and every second the call continues, the meter is running. Hold time costs money. Recovery attempts cost money. Even the silence between turns costs money if you are being billed per session minute.

This chapter teaches the cost governance mechanisms that keep voice AI economically viable. It covers real-time cost monitoring, circuit breakers that stop expensive calls before they bankrupt you, unit economics models that reveal whether your product can scale profitably, and the optimization patterns that reduce spend without degrading the user experience.
