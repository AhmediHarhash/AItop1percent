# 2.13 — The Total Cost of the Voice Stack: Beyond Per-Minute Pricing

The CFO reviewed the voice AI business case and approved it immediately. The vendor quoted $0.024 per minute for ASR, LLM, and TTS combined. At 80,000 minutes per month, the direct API cost was $1,920 — well within budget. Six months into production, the total monthly cost had reached $14,300. The API fees were $2,100. The remaining $12,200 covered compute for orchestration, storage for call recordings, compliance auditing, monitoring infrastructure, and the engineering time required to maintain the system.

Per-minute API pricing is the most visible cost, but it is often less than 20% of total cost of ownership. The hidden costs — infrastructure, storage, compliance, and labor — dominate at scale. Teams that budget only for API fees discover the real cost six months late, after they have committed to the architecture and cannot back out without abandoning the product.

## Orchestration and Compute Overhead

Voice AI systems require an orchestration layer that manages API calls, handles streaming audio, routes requests, retries failures, and enforces timeouts. This orchestration layer runs on your infrastructure — cloud VMs, Kubernetes pods, or serverless functions. The compute cost depends on call volume, concurrency, and how efficiently your code handles streaming audio.

A single voice call requires continuous compute for the call's duration. If the average call lasts 3 minutes and you handle 1,000 concurrent calls, your orchestration layer must sustain 3,000 minutes of compute simultaneously. At typical cloud pricing, a VM instance with sufficient CPU and memory to handle 50 concurrent calls costs $80 to $150 per month. Handling 1,000 concurrent calls requires 20 instances, costing $1,600 to $3,000 per month.

Serverless functions reduce idle cost but increase per-invocation cost. AWS Lambda charges $0.0000166667 per GB-second. A 2GB function running for 180 seconds per call costs $0.006 per call. At 80,000 calls per month, that is $480 per month. Lambda also charges per invocation — $0.20 per million invocations. At 80,000 calls, that adds $0.016 per month, negligible. The total serverless cost is roughly $480 per month.

Kubernetes provides the most control and the lowest per-call cost at high scale, but it requires cluster management, autoscaling configuration, and ongoing operational overhead. A managed Kubernetes cluster with three worker nodes costs $300 to $600 per month in management fees plus the cost of the nodes themselves. If your team does not already operate Kubernetes, the learning curve and operational overhead make it uneconomical below 200,000 to 300,000 calls per month.

One customer service platform started with Lambda for orchestration and migrated to Kubernetes after six months. At 60,000 calls per month, Lambda cost $360 per month. At 250,000 calls per month, Lambda cost $1,500 per month. A three-node Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling cost $740 per month in infrastructure plus $1,200 per month in engineering time to manage. The break-even point was around 180,000 calls per month. Below that, Lambda was cheaper. Above that, Kubernetes was cheaper.

## Call Recording Storage and Retention

Compliance, quality assurance, and dispute resolution require storing call recordings. HIPAA requires healthcare providers to retain records for six years. Financial services regulations require seven years. Customer service teams review recordings to evaluate agent performance and improve conversation design. All of this requires storage.

Audio storage costs depend on format, duration, and retention period. A 3-minute call recorded at 16kHz mono with Opus compression produces a 1.2 MB file. At 80,000 calls per month, that is 96 GB per month. Over six years, that accumulates to 6.9 TB. AWS S3 Standard storage costs $0.023 per GB per month. Storing 6.9 TB costs $159 per month.

Archival storage reduces cost for infrequently accessed recordings. S3 Glacier Deep Archive costs $0.00099 per GB per month — 23x cheaper than Standard. If you move recordings older than 90 days to Glacier, the cost drops to $32 per month for the same 6.9 TB. The trade-off is retrieval latency. Glacier Deep Archive takes 12 to 48 hours to retrieve files. If compliance requires on-demand access, you cannot use Glacier.

Transcripts are cheaper to store than audio but still accumulate. A 3-minute call produces roughly 450 words of transcript, or 2.7 KB of text. At 80,000 calls per month, that is 216 MB per month, or 15.6 GB over six years. S3 costs for text are negligible — $0.36 per month. The cost is in querying and processing. If you index transcripts in Elasticsearch or a similar search system, the cluster cost dominates storage cost.

Some compliance regimes require tamper-proof storage. You must prove that recordings have not been altered since capture. AWS S3 Object Lock, Azure Immutable Storage, and Google Cloud Retention Policies provide this guarantee. These features add 10% to 20% to storage costs and introduce operational complexity — you cannot delete recordings even if you want to, which complicates GDPR right-to-erasure requests.

## Compliance and Audit Overhead

Voice AI systems that handle sensitive data — healthcare, finance, payment card information — require compliance audits. Auditors review your architecture, data flows, access controls, and retention policies. They verify that you encrypt data in transit and at rest, that you log access to recordings, and that you restrict access to authorized personnel.

Preparing for a SOC 2 audit costs $30,000 to $80,000 in external auditor fees plus hundreds of hours of internal engineering and legal time. HIPAA audits cost similar amounts. PCI-DSS audits for systems that handle payment card data cost $50,000 to $150,000. These audits recur annually. The cost is not one-time.

Compliance also imposes architectural constraints that increase cost. HIPAA requires encryption at rest. Most cloud storage services offer encryption, but enabling it adds 5% to 15% to compute cost due to encryption overhead. GDPR requires that you delete customer data upon request. If you store recordings in immutable archival storage for compliance with financial regulations, you create a conflict — one regulation requires deletion, another requires retention. Resolving this requires either geographic data segregation or complex data lifecycle policies.

One telehealth company discovered that their voice AI provider stored audio in a multi-tenant data store that commingled recordings from different customers. HIPAA requires that patient data be logically isolated. The provider could not guarantee isolation without migrating to a dedicated infrastructure tier that cost 40% more. The company paid the premium or risked losing their HIPAA certification.

## Monitoring, Logging, and Observability

Production voice systems require monitoring for latency, accuracy, cost, uptime, and user satisfaction. This monitoring infrastructure has its own cost.

Application Performance Monitoring tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Dynatrace charge per host, per metric, or per log volume. A typical voice AI deployment sends thousands of metrics per minute — ASR latency, LLM token counts, TTS generation time, API error rates, queue depths, concurrent connection counts. At 1,000 concurrent calls, you generate 50,000 to 100,000 metric data points per minute. Datadog charges $15 per host per month plus $0.10 per million custom metrics. At 100,000 metrics per minute, that is 4.3 billion metrics per month, costing $430 per month in metric ingestion alone.

Log aggregation costs scale similarly. Each API call generates 10 to 50 log lines — request details, response times, error codes, transcription snippets. At 80,000 calls per month, that is 800,000 to 4 million log lines. Storing logs in Elasticsearch costs $0.80 to $1.20 per GB per month. If each log line averages 500 bytes, 4 million lines is 2 GB per month, costing $2.40. The cost is negligible until you retain logs for compliance. If you retain logs for two years, the cost is $57.60 per month.

Distributed tracing — tracking a single request across ASR, LLM, and TTS providers — requires trace collectors, storage backends, and query interfaces. Jaeger, Zipkin, or commercial tracing tools like Honeycomb or Lightstep charge per span. A single voice call generates 20 to 100 spans depending on architecture complexity. At 80,000 calls per month, that is 1.6 to 8 million spans. Honeycomb charges $0.001 per span beyond the free tier. At 8 million spans, that is $8,000 per month — often more expensive than the API fees you are tracing.

Most teams compromise. They trace 5% to 10% of requests in production and rely on aggregate metrics for the rest. This reduces tracing cost by 90% while retaining enough data to debug issues. The trade-off is that rare failures — those that occur once per 10,000 calls — might not appear in the sampled traces.

## Integration and Maintenance Engineering

Building a production voice AI system requires engineering time. The initial build — integrating ASR, LLM, and TTS providers, implementing orchestration logic, configuring monitoring, and deploying to production — takes 400 to 1,200 hours depending on complexity. At a loaded cost of $150 per hour for a senior engineer, that is $60,000 to $180,000 in upfront cost.

Ongoing maintenance requires 20 to 60 hours per month. Engineers update dependencies, respond to provider API changes, tune performance, debug latency spikes, and implement new features. At $150 per hour, that is $3,000 to $9,000 per month in labor cost.

If you use a single-provider solution, maintenance is lower — 10 to 20 hours per month, or $1,500 to $3,000. If you use a multi-provider architecture, maintenance is higher — 40 to 80 hours per month, or $6,000 to $12,000. The difference is proportional to the number of integrations, the number of failure modes, and the frequency of provider updates.

On-call support adds cost if your voice AI runs 24/7. Engineers must respond to production incidents outside business hours. A typical on-call rotation requires one engineer per week. If you rotate four engineers, each is on call one week per month. On-call pay varies by company but often adds 10% to 20% to base salary. For a team of four engineers earning $180,000 per year, on-call adds $72,000 to $144,000 per year in total compensation, or $6,000 to $12,000 per month.

## Telephony Costs Beyond API Fees

Telephony providers charge for phone number rentals, per-minute call time, and SMS for verification. A US phone number costs $1 to $2 per month. A toll-free number costs $2 to $5 per month. If you operate in 20 countries, you need 20 local numbers, costing $20 to $100 per month.

Inbound call minutes cost $0.004 to $0.015 per minute depending on the country. If you handle 80,000 calls averaging 3 minutes each, that is 240,000 minutes per month. At $0.008 per minute, telephony costs $1,920 per month — equal to or greater than the ASR, LLM, and TTS costs combined.

Outbound calls cost more — $0.01 to $0.05 per minute depending on destination. If your voice assistant places 20,000 outbound calls per month averaging 2 minutes each, that is 40,000 minutes at $0.02 per minute, or $800 per month.

Number porting — transferring an existing phone number to a new provider — costs $10 to $50 per number. If you migrate 50 numbers, that is $500 to $2,500 in one-time fees. Some providers waive porting fees, others do not.

## The Full Cost Model

To calculate total cost of ownership, sum all components:

**Direct API costs**: ASR, LLM, TTS per-minute fees. This is the number in the vendor proposal. Typically $0.015 to $0.045 per minute at list pricing, $0.010 to $0.030 per minute with volume discounts.

**Telephony costs**: Inbound and outbound per-minute fees, phone number rentals. Typically $0.004 to $0.015 per minute for inbound, $1 to $5 per month per number.

**Orchestration compute**: VMs, Kubernetes, or serverless functions. Typically $0.003 to $0.012 per call depending on architecture and scale.

**Storage**: Call recordings, transcripts, archival. Typically $0.001 to $0.003 per call for six-year retention with archival tiers.

**Monitoring and observability**: APM tools, log aggregation, tracing. Typically $0.002 to $0.008 per call depending on sampling rates and retention.

**Compliance and audit**: Annual audit fees, compliance tooling, legal review. Amortize annual cost across monthly call volume. Typically $0.001 to $0.005 per call for regulated industries.

**Engineering labor**: Integration, maintenance, on-call. Amortize monthly labor cost across monthly call volume. Typically $0.03 to $0.15 per call depending on team size and architecture complexity.

For a system handling 80,000 calls per month with an average 3-minute duration, a realistic total cost model looks like this:

Direct API costs at $0.024 per minute: $5,760 per month. Telephony at $0.008 per minute: $1,920 per month. Orchestration compute: $480 per month. Storage: $180 per month. Monitoring: $450 per month. Compliance amortized: $300 per month. Engineering labor: $4,500 per month.

Total: $13,590 per month, or $0.17 per call. The per-minute API fee represents 42% of total cost. Engineering labor represents 33%. The remaining 25% is infrastructure, storage, and compliance.

## Unit Economics and Break-Even Analysis

If your voice AI generates revenue — closing sales, reducing agent cost, increasing conversion rates — unit economics determine whether the product is viable. Calculate revenue or cost savings per call, subtract total cost per call, and multiply by monthly call volume.

A sales assistant that increases close rates by 4% on 10,000 sales calls per month, with an average deal size of $1,200, generates $480,000 in incremental annual revenue. If the total cost is $0.17 per call, the monthly cost is $1,700. The annual cost is $20,400. The ROI is 2,250%. The product is obviously viable.

A customer support assistant that reduces average handle time by 30 seconds per call, saving 40,000 seconds per month, saves 667 agent-hours per month. At $25 per hour, that is $16,675 per month in savings. If the total cost is $13,590 per month, the net savings is $3,085 per month, or $37,020 per year. The ROI is 22%. The product is viable but less compelling.

If total cost per call exceeds revenue or savings per call, the product is not viable unless you can reduce cost, increase volume to achieve economies of scale, or find additional value that justifies the cost. This calculation must happen before you build, not after you deploy.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

Reduce orchestration cost by batching requests, caching responses, and minimizing cold starts. If 15% of calls ask the same question, cache the LLM response and serve it without calling the API. If 40% of TTS output uses the same phrases, pre-generate and cache the audio.

Reduce storage cost by compressing audio, using archival tiers for old recordings, and purging non-essential logs. If regulatory retention is six years but quality assurance only reviews recordings from the past 90 days, move older recordings to Glacier Deep Archive.

Reduce monitoring cost by sampling traces, aggregating metrics, and retaining logs selectively. Trace 10% of calls instead of 100%. Retain error logs forever but retain info-level logs for 30 days.

Reduce API cost by negotiating volume discounts, committing to annual contracts, and choosing cheaper providers for low-stakes use cases. If your contract renews in six months and your volume doubled, renegotiate pricing before renewal.

Reduce engineering cost by consolidating providers, automating common tasks, and reducing architectural complexity. If you spend 20 hours per month managing three ASR providers, consolidate to one and redeploy the engineering time to higher-value work.

The optimization that delivers the most value depends on which cost component dominates. If engineering labor is 50% of total cost, reducing API fees by 20% saves far less than reducing engineering time by 20%. If API fees are 60% of total cost, renegotiating pricing saves more than optimizing infrastructure.

The total cost of the voice stack is the sum of every component, not just the vendor invoice. Teams that model total cost accurately build sustainable products. Teams that model only API fees discover six months into production that the business case never existed.
