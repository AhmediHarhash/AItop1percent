# 7.11 — User Expectations by Domain: Customer Service vs Healthcare

A barge-in threshold that works perfectly for customer service will destroy the experience in healthcare. In early 2025, a voice platform provider built a single barge-in model and deployed it across all their customers — e-commerce support, banking, healthcare scheduling, IT helpdesk. The model was tuned on customer service data where users interrupt frequently and expect fast responses. Precision was 91%, recall was 89%, premature cutoff rate was 5%. The customer service clients were happy. The healthcare clients revolted.

Within two weeks, a large hospital network reported that patients were complaining the system felt "rushed" and "impatient." Elderly patients would pause mid-sentence to gather their thoughts, and the system would assume they were done and start responding. Patients with cognitive impairments or speech difficulties would take 3 seconds to formulate a sentence, and the system would interrupt them with a response before they finished. Satisfaction scores for healthcare dropped 22% while customer service scores stayed flat.

The platform provider analyzed the audio. Healthcare conversations had inter-turn pauses averaging 1.8 seconds, compared to 0.6 seconds in customer service. Patients paused longer because they were thinking about symptoms, recalling dates, or processing medical terminology. The barge-in model, trained on snappy customer service exchanges, interpreted these pauses as turn completions. The fix required domain-specific barge-in thresholds and separate models for healthcare versus customer service. Once deployed, healthcare satisfaction recovered to baseline within three weeks.

User expectations for turn-taking are not universal. They vary by domain, by user demographic, by task urgency, and by cultural context. A system optimized for one domain will fail in another if it does not account for these differences.

## Customer Service: Speed and Efficiency

Customer service users expect quick turn-taking. They are calling to resolve a problem — track a package, dispute a charge, reset a password — and they want the conversation to move fast. Pauses feel like the system is slow or confused. Interruptions are expected because users want to correct the agent or provide missing information immediately.

The ideal inter-turn pause for customer service is 300 to 500 milliseconds. Anything under 300 milliseconds feels too aggressive — the agent cuts off the user mid-thought. Anything over 600 milliseconds feels sluggish, and users start repeating themselves because they think the system did not hear them. The sweet spot is 400 milliseconds: fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to let the user finish.

Barge-in should be sensitive in customer service. If the user starts speaking while the agent is talking, the agent should yield within 400 milliseconds. Users expect to interrupt, especially if the agent is giving a long explanation and the user already knows the answer. If the agent keeps talking for 1 or 2 seconds after the user starts speaking, the user perceives the agent as "not listening" or "robotic."

Premature cutoff is less damaging in customer service than in other domains. If the agent stops mid-sentence because the user coughed, the user can say "keep going" or "continue," and the interaction recovers quickly. Customer service conversations are transactional. Users are goal-oriented and forgiving of small errors as long as the conversation moves forward. A premature cutoff rate of 6% is acceptable in customer service. In healthcare, the same rate would be a crisis.

## Healthcare: Patience and Reassurance

Healthcare users expect patience. They are describing symptoms, recalling medical history, or making decisions about treatment. Many are elderly, many have cognitive or speech impairments, many are anxious or in pain. They need time to think, time to speak, and reassurance that the system is listening without rushing them.

The ideal inter-turn pause for healthcare is 800 milliseconds to 1.5 seconds. This feels unnaturally slow in customer service, but in healthcare it signals patience. A 1-second pause tells the patient "I am waiting for you to finish, take your time." A 400-millisecond pause tells the patient "hurry up," which increases anxiety and decreases satisfaction.

Barge-in should be insensitive in healthcare. The threshold for detecting an interruption should be higher — louder audio, longer duration, more confident speech detection — because many patients pause, sigh, or make non-speech sounds while formulating their thoughts. If the agent stops talking every time the patient says "um" or "let me think," the conversation becomes fragmented and frustrating.

Premature cutoff is catastrophic in healthcare. If a patient is mid-sentence describing chest pain and the agent stops to ask a clarifying question, the patient loses their train of thought and may omit critical information. Premature cutoff in healthcare is not just annoying — it is a safety risk. The acceptable premature cutoff rate in healthcare is under 2%, ideally under 1%. This means you need a very conservative barge-in model that only yields when it is certain the patient is making a deliberate interruption.

You also need to handle long pauses gracefully. If a patient pauses for 5 seconds, the agent should not assume the patient is done. The agent should wait, or provide a gentle prompt: "Take your time, I'm here when you're ready." This requires detecting extended silence and distinguishing it from end-of-utterance. A patient who pauses for 5 seconds mid-sentence is still in the middle of their turn. A customer service user who pauses for 5 seconds is probably distracted and the agent should prompt them.

## Financial Services: Formality and Precision

Financial conversations sit between customer service and healthcare. Users expect efficiency, but they also expect precision. They are discussing account numbers, transaction amounts, investment decisions. Mistakes are costly. Interruptions are acceptable, but only if they are clearly intentional.

The ideal inter-turn pause for financial services is 500 to 700 milliseconds. Faster than healthcare, slower than customer service. This gives users time to read numbers from a document, to double-check a figure, to think through a decision. It also signals that the agent is listening carefully and not rushing.

Barge-in should be moderate. The agent should yield if the user interrupts with a correction or a question, but it should not stop for background noise or hesitation sounds. Financial users are often multitasking — looking at their computer, checking their phone, talking to a spouse in the next room. The barge-in model needs to distinguish between the user addressing the agent and the user talking to someone else.

Premature cutoff in financial services is embarrassing but not dangerous. If the agent stops mid-sentence while explaining an investment option, the user will ask the agent to repeat, and the conversation continues. But repeated premature cutoffs erode trust. If the user feels the agent is not listening or keeps getting confused, they will escalate to a human. The acceptable premature cutoff rate for financial services is 3% to 4%.

## Education and Tutoring: Encouragement and Wait Time

Educational voice agents — tutoring, language learning, exam prep — need to balance patience with engagement. Students need time to think, but they also need encouragement to speak up. Long pauses can feel supportive or awkward depending on context.

The ideal inter-turn pause for education is 600 milliseconds to 1 second after the agent asks a question, but 300 to 400 milliseconds when the agent is giving feedback. After asking "What is the capital of France?" the agent should wait 1 second to give the student time to think. After the student answers, the agent should respond quickly — within 400 milliseconds — to maintain engagement.

Barge-in should be very permissive in education. Students often start answering before the agent finishes asking the question, especially if they know the answer. The agent should yield immediately. But if the student makes a non-speech sound — a sigh, a laugh, a groan — the agent should not interpret it as an interruption. Educational barge-in models need to distinguish between speech and vocalization.

Premature cutoff in education is demotivating. If a student is mid-sentence explaining their reasoning and the agent cuts them off, the student feels dismissed. This is especially harmful for students who are already anxious about speaking. The acceptable premature cutoff rate in education is under 3%.

## Voice Commerce: Speed and Confirmation

Voice commerce — ordering products, booking reservations, purchasing tickets — prioritizes speed but requires explicit confirmation. Users want the transaction to complete quickly, but they also want reassurance that the agent understood correctly.

The ideal inter-turn pause for commerce is 300 to 500 milliseconds during information gathering, but 700 milliseconds to 1 second during confirmation. When the agent asks "What size?" the user expects a fast exchange. When the agent says "I have you down for a large pizza with pepperoni, is that correct?" the user needs time to process and confirm. The pause signals "this is important, double-check before you agree."

Barge-in should be context-dependent. During fast-paced information gathering, the agent should yield quickly if the user interrupts. During confirmation, the agent should be less sensitive — the user might say "yeah" or "mm-hmm" as backchanneling without intending to take the floor. The barge-in model needs to detect the difference between backchanneling and a real interruption.

Premature cutoff in commerce is costly if it happens during confirmation. If the agent stops mid-sentence while listing the order details, the user might not catch an error. This leads to wrong orders, refunds, and customer support escalations. The acceptable premature cutoff rate during confirmation is under 2%. During information gathering, it can be higher — up to 5% — because users can correct errors easily.

## Gaming and Entertainment: Playfulness and Reactivity

Voice games and entertainment applications — trivia, storytelling, interactive fiction — have different expectations than transactional domains. Users expect the agent to be lively, reactive, and playful. Long pauses feel boring. Interruptions should be encouraged as part of the interaction.

The ideal inter-turn pause for gaming is under 300 milliseconds. The agent should respond almost instantly to create a sense of energy and flow. A 600-millisecond pause in a trivia game feels sluggish and breaks immersion. The exception is dramatic pauses — after revealing an answer, after a plot twist — where a deliberate 1-second pause creates tension.

Barge-in should be highly sensitive in gaming. Users should feel empowered to interrupt at any time — to shout out an answer, to ask for a hint, to skip ahead. The agent should yield within 300 milliseconds. Overlap is acceptable and even desirable in some cases. If the user and the agent both say "yes!" at the same time, that feels collaborative and fun.

Premature cutoff is less harmful in gaming than in other domains. If the agent stops mid-sentence because the user made a noise, it might feel like the agent is being playful or responsive. Users are more forgiving of errors in entertainment contexts because the stakes are low. A premature cutoff rate of 8% to 10% is acceptable in gaming.

## Demographic Differences: Age and Cognitive Load

Beyond domain, user demographics matter. Elderly users pause longer than young users. Users with cognitive impairments or speech difficulties need more time. Non-native speakers pause more frequently as they search for words. A barge-in model optimized for young native speakers will fail for these populations.

Elderly users have inter-turn pauses 1.5 to 2 times longer than young users. A 70-year-old might pause for 1.2 seconds while a 25-year-old pauses for 0.5 seconds. If your system treats 0.8 seconds of silence as end-of-utterance, you will constantly cut off elderly users. You need to detect user age — either from account metadata or from acoustic features like speaking rate and pitch — and adjust barge-in thresholds accordingly.

Users with cognitive load — multitasking, stressed, distracted — also need longer pauses. A user calling while driving, while cooking, or while managing children will have longer pauses and more false starts. The barge-in model should detect these conditions and become more conservative.

Non-native speakers need patience. They pause mid-sentence to search for vocabulary, they repeat phrases to self-correct, they speak more slowly. A barge-in model trained on native speakers will interpret these patterns as turn completions. You need training data that includes non-native speech, or you need to detect non-native speakers and route them to a more patient model.

## Cultural Differences in Turn-Taking Norms

Turn-taking norms vary across cultures. In some cultures, interrupting is considered rude and disruptive. In others, it is a sign of engagement and enthusiasm. A barge-in model optimized for US users will fail for users in other regions.

In high-context cultures — Japan, Korea, many Middle Eastern countries — pauses are longer and interruptions are rare. Users expect the agent to wait patiently and not rush. A barge-in model tuned for US customer service, where interruptions are frequent, will feel aggressive and disrespectful in these cultures.

In low-context cultures — US, Germany, Netherlands — faster turn-taking is normal. Users expect the agent to respond quickly and yield quickly when interrupted. A model tuned for high-context cultures will feel slow and unresponsive.

You handle this by detecting user geography and adjusting thresholds. If the user is calling from Japan, you increase inter-turn pause thresholds by 30% and decrease barge-in sensitivity by 40%. If the user is calling from the US, you use baseline settings. This requires region-specific tuning, but the effort is worthwhile. A single global barge-in model will alienate users in at least some regions.

## Task Urgency and Situational Context

Turn-taking expectations also vary by urgency. A user calling to report a medical emergency expects different timing than a user browsing a product catalog. Urgency is hard to detect automatically, but you can infer it from the conversation content or from explicit signals.

If the user says "this is urgent" or "I need help now," the agent should switch to faster turn-taking. Inter-turn pause drops to 300 milliseconds. Barge-in becomes more sensitive. The agent prioritizes efficiency over patience.

If the user is in a low-urgency context — scheduling a routine appointment, asking general questions — the agent can afford to be patient. Inter-turn pause can be 700 milliseconds or longer. Barge-in can be conservative. The agent prioritizes accuracy and comfort over speed.

You can also adjust timing based on turn number. Early in the conversation, the agent should be patient and give the user time to explain their situation. Later in the conversation, once context is established, the agent can move faster. This progressive acceleration feels natural and matches how human conversations evolve.

## Calibrating Turn-Taking Thresholds by Domain

You cannot use a single set of thresholds across all domains. You need domain-specific configurations. For customer service, you set end-of-utterance detection at 600 milliseconds of silence, barge-in threshold at minus 15 decibels relative to agent volume, and agent-yield latency target under 400 milliseconds. For healthcare, you set end-of-utterance detection at 1.2 seconds, barge-in threshold at minus 10 decibels, and agent-yield latency target under 600 milliseconds.

These thresholds are stored in configuration files or feature flags. At runtime, you detect the conversation domain — from the entry point, from user account metadata, from the first few turns — and load the appropriate thresholds. The same voice pipeline, the same models, but different parameters.

You validate these thresholds with domain-specific evaluation datasets. You collect 1,000 real conversations from each domain, annotate turn-taking quality, and measure metrics. If premature cutoff rate in healthcare is above 2%, you increase the end-of-utterance threshold. If overlap rate in customer service is above 10%, you increase barge-in sensitivity. You iterate until each domain meets its SLOs.

## Multi-Domain Systems and Dynamic Threshold Switching

Some systems serve multiple domains within a single session. A banking voice agent might start with account verification — a fast, transactional exchange — then switch to financial advice, which requires slower, more thoughtful turn-taking. You need to switch thresholds mid-conversation.

You detect the switch by tracking conversation state. When the agent transitions from "verify account" to "discuss investment options," the system switches from customer-service timing to financial-services timing. Inter-turn pause increases from 400 milliseconds to 600 milliseconds. Barge-in threshold decreases. The user does not notice the switch explicitly, but they feel the agent becoming more patient and deliberate.

Dynamic switching requires careful design. If thresholds switch too abruptly, the user notices and the experience feels inconsistent. You smooth the transition by gradually adjusting thresholds over two or three turns. The agent does not jump from 400-millisecond pauses to 1-second pauses instantly. It transitions over 10 to 15 seconds, and the user adapts naturally.

## Measuring Domain-Specific Turn-Taking Quality

You need separate SLOs for each domain. Customer service targets p95 inter-turn pause under 600 milliseconds, overlap rate under 8%, premature cutoff rate under 6%. Healthcare targets p95 inter-turn pause under 1.5 seconds, overlap rate under 5%, premature cutoff rate under 2%. You track these metrics independently and alert separately.

You also collect user feedback segmented by domain. After each conversation, you ask "Did the agent give you enough time to speak?" Users in healthcare might rate this differently than users in customer service, even if the objective timing is the same. Subjective satisfaction depends on expectations, and expectations depend on domain.

If healthcare satisfaction is low even though your timing metrics meet targets, it suggests your targets are wrong. You adjust thresholds based on feedback, retest, and iterate. The goal is not to hit arbitrary numbers — it is to match user expectations for each domain.

## The Cost of Domain-Specific Models

Building separate barge-in models and thresholds for each domain adds complexity. You need separate training datasets, separate evaluation sets, separate monitoring dashboards. The infrastructure cost is modest — storing configurations and routing logic adds minimal latency — but the operational cost is real. You need more annotators, more experiments, more attention.

The alternative is worse. A single model that works poorly for half your users will drive churn, escalations, and bad reviews. The cost of domain-specific tuning is a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of engineering time. The cost of poor turn-taking in a high-stakes domain like healthcare is user harm, compliance risk, and reputational damage.

The decision is straightforward. If you serve multiple domains, you need domain-specific turn-taking. There is no shortcut.

## When to Use Adaptive Models That Learn User Preferences

Some systems go further and build adaptive models that learn individual user preferences over time. If a user consistently interrupts the agent, the system becomes more sensitive to that user's barge-ins. If a user consistently pauses for 2 seconds, the system learns to wait longer before assuming they are done.

Adaptive models require user-level state. You track each user's historical turn-taking patterns — average inter-turn pause, interruption frequency, premature cutoff incidents — and adjust thresholds per user. This is more complex than domain-level configuration, but it can improve satisfaction for users whose behavior differs from the domain average.

The risk is that adaptive models can drift into bad equilibria. If a user starts interrupting frequently because the agent is not yielding fast enough, the system might adapt by becoming even slower, which causes more interruptions, which causes further adaptation in the wrong direction. You need to bound adaptation — limit how far thresholds can deviate from baseline — and reset if metrics degrade.

Adaptive models are most valuable for high-frequency users who interact with the system daily or weekly. For one-time users, domain-level thresholds are sufficient. Adaptation requires multiple sessions to learn, so it provides no benefit for infrequent users.

Turn-taking is not a universal problem with a universal solution. It is a domain-specific, demographic-specific, context-specific challenge that requires tuning, measurement, and continuous refinement. The systems that get this right feel natural and respectful. The systems that get it wrong feel robotic and frustrating, no matter how good the underlying AI is. Turn-taking is where voice UX lives or dies.
