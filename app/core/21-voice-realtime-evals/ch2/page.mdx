# Chapter 2 — The Voice AI Stack in 2026

A production voice system in 2026 is not a monolithic model. It is an orchestrated pipeline of ASR, LLM, and TTS components, often from different providers, each with its own latency budget, failure modes, and quality characteristics. The architecture decisions you make at this layer — which providers to use, how to combine them, how to handle failures in one component without breaking the entire conversation — determine whether your system can meet the sub-second latency budgets that voice requires.

This chapter maps the voice AI landscape as it exists today. The provider ecosystem has matured. Speech-to-speech models are emerging as an alternative to the cascaded pipeline. Multi-provider architectures are standard at scale. But the fundamental question remains the same: how do you compose a system where every component must be fast, accurate, and reliable simultaneously, and where a failure in any one layer destroys the user experience?

Understanding the stack is not optional background. It is the foundation for every evaluation decision you will make in this section.

*The voice AI stack is a latency budget distributed across providers, each of which can fail independently. Your evaluation strategy must account for all of them.*
