# 28.11 — Tenant Holdbacks and Opt-Out Rights: When Customers Refuse to Move

The instinct of every platform team is to keep all tenants on the same version. One version means one serving configuration, one set of eval baselines, one regression matrix, and one operational surface to monitor. Heterogeneity is the enemy of operational efficiency. When a customer refuses to accept an update — whether it is a base model migration, an adapter retraining, a safety filter change, or a prompt template revision — the natural reaction is to push them forward. Explain the benefits. Show the improved benchmarks. Set a deprecation date. Force the move.

This instinct is wrong, and acting on it will cost you enterprise contracts.

Some customers have legitimate, non-negotiable reasons to refuse updates, and those reasons are not technical objections you can address with better benchmarks. They are contractual, regulatory, and operational constraints that exist outside your platform's engineering reality. The platform that treats every holdback as a customer education problem loses the customers whose constraints are real. The platform that builds holdback support into its operating model retains those customers and earns the deep trust that comes from respecting boundaries.

## Legitimate Holdback Reasons

Five categories of holdback requests are legitimate, and your platform must have a policy for each.

**Regulatory audit in progress.** When a tenant is undergoing a regulatory audit — FDA inspection for a medical device that incorporates AI, OCC examination for a bank's AI-powered risk models, EU AI Act compliance review for a high-risk system — any change to the AI system during the audit creates complications. Auditors need to evaluate a stable system. A model update during the audit period means the system being audited is no longer the system in production, which invalidates findings, extends timelines, and increases cost. Healthcare customers undergoing FDA reviews routinely request six-to-twelve-month freezes on all AI system changes. Financial services customers facing regulatory examinations typically request three-to-six-month freezes. These are not arbitrary preferences. They are risk management decisions driven by regulatory exposure that can reach tens of millions of dollars in penalties.

**Change control windows.** Enterprise customers in regulated industries operate formal change control processes where every modification to a production system requires documented approval from a change advisory board. The approval process involves impact assessment, risk analysis, rollback planning, and sign-off from multiple stakeholders. This process takes two to eight weeks depending on the organization's size and regulatory environment. A customer with a monthly change control cycle cannot accept ad-hoc updates pushed by your platform on your release schedule. They need to evaluate the change, submit it through their internal process, receive approval, and then accept the update on a date they control. Forcing an update outside this window violates their internal compliance framework, which can have consequences ranging from audit findings to executive escalation.

**Contractual "no changes without approval" clauses.** Some enterprise contracts include explicit language prohibiting the platform from modifying the AI system's behavior without written customer approval. These clauses are common in healthcare, defense, financial services, and any industry where AI output directly affects high-stakes decisions. The clause exists because the customer validated the AI system in its current state — their clinicians tested it, their compliance team reviewed it, their quality team benchmarked it — and any change invalidates that validation. The customer is not being difficult. They are enforcing a contract term that your sales team agreed to because it was the only way to close a $400,000 deal.

**Downstream system dependencies.** Some tenants have built internal systems that depend on specific behaviors of your AI output. A logistics company built a routing optimization layer that parses the structured output from their LoRA adapter, expecting specific field names, specific value ranges, and specific formatting patterns. A model or adapter update that changes output format — even if the new format is objectively better — breaks their downstream system. The tenant needs time to update their integration before accepting the change. This is not a holdback in the traditional sense — the customer wants the update — but they need a controlled migration window rather than an instant switch.

**Pending internal validation.** Enterprise customers with rigorous AI governance — and by 2026, the EU AI Act requires this for high-risk systems — run internal validation cycles before accepting any change to AI components. Their data science team evaluates the new version against their internal test suites. Their domain experts review sample outputs. Their compliance team assesses whether the change affects their risk classification. This validation takes two to six weeks, during which the customer runs the old version in production and the new version in a shadow or staging environment. Pressuring the customer to skip this validation undermines the governance framework that regulators require them to maintain.

## The Holdback Policy

A holdback policy defines the rules of engagement: how long a tenant can stay on a deprecated version, what happens when the holdback expires, who pays for the additional operational cost, and what the exceptions are.

**Maximum holdback duration** should be tiered by reason. Regulatory audit holdbacks get the longest window — up to twelve months or until the audit concludes, whichever comes first. Change control holdbacks get a standard window aligned to the customer's change control cycle — typically 30 to 90 days. Contractual holdbacks are governed by the contract itself and may require negotiation. Downstream dependency holdbacks get a migration window — typically 60 to 120 days — with the expectation that the customer is actively updating their integration during that window.

**Renewal process.** Holdbacks are not indefinite. Every holdback has an expiration date, and approaching that date triggers a renewal review. The customer must provide evidence that the original holdback reason still applies — the audit is still in progress, the change control approval is still pending, the downstream migration is still underway. If the reason has resolved but the customer still wants to hold, the holdback transitions from legitimate to preference, and the policy response changes. Legitimate holdbacks are accommodated at platform expense. Preference holdbacks are accommodated at customer expense, because the operational cost of supporting an outdated version is real and should not be subsidized by other tenants.

**Cost allocation.** Supporting a holdback tenant requires running infrastructure for the deprecated version alongside the current version. The deprecated base model, adapter weights, and serving configuration consume GPU memory, storage, and operational attention. For short-duration holdbacks within the standard window, the platform absorbs this cost as part of enterprise service. For extended holdbacks beyond the standard window, the cost should be allocated to the holdback tenant. The allocation mechanism can be a holdback surcharge (a fixed monthly fee for version pinning), a tiered pricing adjustment, or a contract amendment that reflects the additional operational cost. The specific mechanism matters less than the principle: the tenant should understand that holding back has a cost, and that cost increases over time.

## The Operational Cost of Supporting Holdback Tenants

Every holdback tenant adds operational burden in five dimensions. Understanding these costs is essential for setting holdback policy and pricing.

**Dual infrastructure.** The deprecated version must continue running. If the holdback involves a base model version, you are serving two base models simultaneously — the current version for the majority of tenants and the deprecated version for the holdback tenants. If only one or two tenants are holding back, you may be dedicating an entire GPU node to a base model that serves less than 1 percent of your traffic. The infrastructure cost per request for holdback tenants is dramatically higher than for current-version tenants. A platform that migrated from a 7 billion parameter model to a 13 billion parameter model but maintains the 7B deployment for three holdback tenants spends roughly $2,800 per month on infrastructure that serves 0.4 percent of total traffic.

**Security patching on old versions.** Deprecated versions still require security updates. A vulnerability discovered in the serving infrastructure, the base model's tokenizer, or the adapter loading pipeline must be patched on both the current and deprecated versions. If the deprecated version uses a different software stack — an older version of vLLM, an older CUDA driver, an older operating system — the patching effort may be substantially higher than for the current version. Security teams must maintain awareness of the deprecated version's dependency tree and ensure it receives timely patches, even though no one is actively developing against it.

**Monitoring and on-call coverage.** Holdback tenants still require production monitoring, alerting, and incident response. An outage affecting the deprecated serving cluster pages the on-call engineer, who must understand both the current and deprecated configurations to diagnose and resolve the issue. Over time, institutional knowledge of the deprecated version fades. Engineers who were familiar with its configuration leave the team or forget the details. The on-call runbook grows longer and more complex. The mean time to resolution for incidents on deprecated versions is typically 2 to 3 times longer than for current versions because the team has less familiarity and fewer diagnostic tools available.

**Eval pipeline branching.** The holdback tenant's eval configuration must continue running against the deprecated version. If the eval pipeline includes per-tenant judges, golden sets, and quality thresholds, those configurations must be maintained for the deprecated version separately. Any improvement to the eval pipeline — a new judge model, an updated scoring rubric, a refined threshold calculation — must either be backported to the deprecated version or the holdback tenant must accept running an outdated eval configuration. Most teams choose not to backport eval improvements, which means holdback tenants gradually receive less sophisticated quality monitoring than current-version tenants.

**Cognitive overhead.** Perhaps the least visible but most corrosive cost is the mental model complexity that holdback tenants impose on the entire platform team. Every design decision, every incident analysis, and every capacity planning exercise must consider: "does this affect holdback tenants differently?" The engineer debugging a quality regression must check whether the affected requests were served by the current version or the deprecated version. The capacity planner must account for the deprecated cluster's resource consumption. The product team must assess whether a new feature is compatible with the deprecated version or requires holdback tenants to upgrade first. This cognitive overhead scales linearly with the number of distinct versions in production and is consistently underestimated until the team is managing four or five concurrent versions and every meeting includes the phrase "does this apply to the legacy cluster?"

## When Holdback Becomes Untenable

Not every holdback can be sustained indefinitely, even when the customer's reason is legitimate. Four conditions make continued holdback untenable.

**Security vulnerability in the deprecated version that cannot be patched.** If the deprecated base model or serving infrastructure has a vulnerability that requires an architectural change to remediate — not just a patch but a fundamental update — the holdback tenant faces a binary choice: accept the update or accept the vulnerability. Your platform cannot responsibly serve a known-vulnerable configuration, regardless of the holdback reason. This conversation is difficult. The customer has a legitimate reason for holding. Your security team has a legitimate reason for forcing the move. The resolution typically involves an emergency change control process on the customer's side, expedited by the severity of the vulnerability.

**End of vendor support for the deprecated model.** If the base model in the deprecated version reaches end of life from the model provider — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or Meta stops supporting the model version, discontinues its API, or stops providing safety updates — you cannot continue serving it. This is the model equivalent of a software vendor ending support for an old operating system. The holdback tenant must migrate, and the holdback policy should include clear language about vendor end-of-life as a holdback termination event.

**Operational cost exceeding economic viability.** When the fully loaded cost of maintaining the deprecated infrastructure exceeds the holdback tenant's contract value, the holdback is economically untenable. A customer paying $60,000 per year whose holdback costs $4,200 per month in dual infrastructure, security patching, and operational overhead is costing you $50,400 per year in holdback-specific expenses. The net margin on that customer has collapsed to near zero. At this point, the conversation shifts from accommodation to renegotiation: the customer either absorbs the holdback cost or migrates.

**Regulatory requirement on the platform.** The EU AI Act and similar regulations may impose requirements on AI system providers that are incompatible with serving deprecated configurations. If a new regulatory requirement mandates specific transparency, logging, or safety controls that cannot be retrofitted to the deprecated version, you face a regulatory obligation that supersedes the customer's holdback right. This scenario is increasingly common as AI regulation matures, and holdback policies should explicitly acknowledge that platform-level regulatory obligations can override tenant-level holdback requests.

## The Opt-Out Negotiation

When a holdback becomes untenable, the conversation with the customer matters as much as the technical decision. A forced migration handled poorly destroys the relationship. A forced migration handled well strengthens it.

The negotiation follows three steps. First, provide advance notice — 90 days minimum for standard holdback terminations, 30 days for security-driven terminations. The notice should explain the specific reason the holdback is ending, the date of mandatory migration, and the support the platform will provide during the transition. Second, offer migration assistance — dedicated engineering support during the customer's change control process, shadow-mode deployment of the new version alongside the old version for the customer's internal validation, and a rollback window (typically 7 to 14 days post-migration) during which the deprecated version remains available as a safety net. Third, document everything — the holdback history, the termination reason, the notice provided, the migration support offered, and the customer's acknowledgment. This documentation protects both parties and provides evidence of good-faith engagement if the relationship sours.

The platform that handles holdbacks well — accommodating legitimate needs, communicating costs transparently, and managing forced migrations with empathy — builds a reputation for being enterprise-grade in the deepest sense. Enterprise customers expect technical capability. They stay for operational maturity. Holdback management is one of the clearest signals of that maturity.

Holdback tenants opt out of changes entirely. But even tenants who accept changes want evidence that the changes help their specific situation. The next subchapter examines how to run per-tenant experiments — A/B tests, canary deployments, and controlled rollouts — when your tenants have wildly unequal traffic volumes and per-tenant statistical power is a constant constraint.
