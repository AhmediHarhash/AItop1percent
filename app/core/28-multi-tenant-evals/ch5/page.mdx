# Chapter 5 — Customer Onboarding for Evaluation Systems

The first ninety days of a new enterprise customer determine whether the eval system will serve them well or spend the next year playing catch-up. During onboarding, your team must translate vague business expectations into precise quality definitions, bootstrap ground truth from little or no data, calibrate rubrics against a customer who may not yet know what they want, and establish baseline metrics before anyone has started optimizing. Get this right and the customer trusts the platform from day one. Get it wrong and every quality conversation for the next twelve months starts with "your numbers don't match what we see."

This chapter covers the onboarding ramp — the structured, repeatable process of bringing a new enterprise customer into the evaluation system. You will learn discovery techniques, golden set bootstrapping, rubric calibration workshops, and the traps that teams fall into when they move too fast or too slow.
