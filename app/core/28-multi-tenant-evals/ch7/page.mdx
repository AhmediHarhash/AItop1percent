# Chapter 7 — Cost Allocation, Customer Reporting, Evidence, and the Feedback Loop

Multi-tenant eval systems serve two masters. The platform team needs to operate efficiently, understand where eval spend goes, and justify infrastructure investment. The customers need proof — not promises — that they are getting what they pay for. These two needs converge in cost attribution, quality reporting, audit-grade evidence packages, and the feedback loops that let customers correct the system when it gets their quality wrong.

This chapter covers the business layer of multi-tenant evaluation: how to attribute eval costs to specific customers, how to build quality reports that satisfy technical teams and legal teams and executive teams simultaneously, how to produce evidence packages that survive regulatory audits, and how to handle the inevitable moment when a customer says "your quality score is wrong" and you need a process that resolves the disagreement without destroying the relationship.

*The eval system that cannot explain its costs or prove its results is the eval system that loses budget in the next planning cycle. The next subchapter shows how to make every dollar traceable.*
