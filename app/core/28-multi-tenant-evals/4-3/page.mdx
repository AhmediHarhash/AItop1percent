# 28.3 — Platform Floor, Tenant Ceiling: The Architecture of Layered Quality Standards

Your platform cannot serve 500 customers if every customer's quality definition is a bespoke system with no shared foundation. And your platform cannot keep 500 customers if every customer's quality is measured against one undifferentiated standard that ignores their specific needs. The answer is neither full standardization nor full customization. It is a layered architecture — a **Platform Floor** that guarantees minimum quality for every tenant, and a **Tenant Ceiling** that lets individual customers define stricter, domain-specific requirements above that floor.

This is the most important structural decision you will make in multi-tenant evaluation. Get it right, and your platform scales to thousands of customers without building per-customer evaluation code. Get it wrong, and you either deliver a one-size-fits-all quality experience that your most demanding customers outgrow, or you drown in per-customer customization that no team can maintain.

## What the Platform Floor Guarantees

The Platform Floor is the set of quality standards that every output on your platform must meet, regardless of which tenant it belongs to, which configuration produced it, or which tier the tenant occupies. Think of it as the non-negotiable minimum. Any output that falls below the floor is a platform failure, not a customer-specific issue.

The floor typically covers four domains. The first is safety — no output should contain harmful content, generate personally identifiable information in contexts where it should not, or produce instructions for dangerous activities. This is universal because no customer contract should allow unsafe outputs, and your platform's liability exposure does not depend on which customer triggered the output. Whether your customer is a healthcare company or a retail brand, an output that generates harmful content is a platform failure.

The second domain is basic accuracy — outputs should not contain clearly fabricated information presented as fact, should not contradict well-established knowledge without basis, and should not hallucinate entities, dates, or numbers in contexts where correctness is implied. The floor accuracy standard is deliberately lower than what most enterprise customers require. It is not "outputs are always correct." It is "outputs are not egregiously wrong in ways that any reasonable user would notice." A healthcare customer's accuracy ceiling will be far higher than the floor, but the floor catches the catastrophic failures that would damage any customer.

The third domain is latency — every output should be delivered within a maximum response time that the platform commits to across all tiers. If your platform's architecture supports a P99 latency of 8 seconds, the floor guarantees that no tenant experiences latencies routinely exceeding that bound. Individual tenants may negotiate tighter latency ceilings, but the floor prevents any tenant from being de-prioritized to the point of unusable performance.

The fourth domain is format compliance — outputs should conform to basic structural expectations. If the platform promises JSON output, the output should be parseable JSON. If it promises markdown, it should be valid markdown. Format failures break customer integrations regardless of content quality, and they are detectable automatically, which makes them an ideal floor-level check.

Defining the floor is not a one-time exercise. The floor evolves as the platform matures, as regulatory requirements change, and as the industry's definition of minimum acceptable quality rises. The EU AI Act's general-purpose AI provisions, which become enforceable for systemic risk obligations in August 2026, effectively raise the floor for any platform operating in or serving the European market. Safety, transparency, and documentation requirements that were previously best practices become floor-level obligations. Your floor must track these external requirements or risk non-compliance across your entire customer base.

## What the Tenant Ceiling Defines

The Tenant Ceiling is the set of additional quality requirements that a specific customer defines above the platform floor. Ceilings are where per-customer evaluation gets specific — where the pharmaceutical company says "every clinical claim must be traceable to a cited source" and the financial advisory firm says "numerical values must be accurate to two decimal places."

Ceilings build on the Quality Contract introduced in Chapter 2. Where the Quality Contract defines what dimensions matter and what weights they carry, the ceiling translates those definitions into enforceable evaluation thresholds that the eval pipeline checks on every run. A customer whose Quality Contract specifies citation fidelity at 40 percent weight with a per-dimension floor of 80 percent gets a ceiling configuration that includes a citation fidelity evaluator, a threshold of 80 percent for that dimension, and a composite score formula that weights citation fidelity at 40 percent.

Ceilings vary in complexity by customer tier. Self-serve customers on your platform's standard tier typically inherit the platform floor with minimal ceiling additions — perhaps a custom accuracy threshold and a preferred output format, but no domain-specific evaluation dimensions. Mid-tier customers get moderately complex ceilings — three to five custom dimensions with customer-specific thresholds. Enterprise customers get full ceiling configurations that may include custom judge prompts, domain-specific rubric dimensions, customer-provided golden sets, and regulatory compliance checks specific to their industry. A healthcare enterprise customer's ceiling might include HIPAA-relevant checks that evaluate whether outputs appropriately handle protected health information. A financial services customer's ceiling might include SOX-relevant checks that evaluate numerical accuracy and audit trail completeness.

The engineering cost of ceiling complexity determines your pricing and packaging, a topic explored in depth in Section 30. The important architectural principle is that ceiling complexity is a parameter, not a code change. Adding a new dimension to a customer's ceiling should require configuration, not deployment. If your eval infrastructure requires code changes to support a new customer's ceiling, you will not scale past 50 customers before the engineering burden becomes unsustainable.

## The Inheritance Model

Ceilings do not replace the floor. They extend it. This distinction is critical because it determines how the eval pipeline processes each tenant's quality assessment.

When the eval system evaluates outputs for a given tenant, it first applies the platform floor checks. Every output is scored against safety, basic accuracy, latency, and format compliance. If any floor check fails, the output is flagged as a platform-level failure regardless of the tenant's ceiling results. A tenant whose ceiling does not include a safety dimension still benefits from the platform floor's safety check. A tenant whose ceiling defines a more permissive safety threshold than the platform floor is still held to the floor — the floor is a minimum, and tenants cannot configure below it.

After floor checks pass, the eval system applies the tenant's ceiling checks. These are the customer-specific dimensions, weights, and thresholds defined in the tenant's Quality Contract and encoded in their ceiling configuration. The ceiling results determine the tenant's quality score, their SLA compliance, and the content of their quality reports. Ceiling checks can be stricter than floor checks on the same dimension — a tenant can require 95 percent accuracy when the floor requires 70 percent — but they cannot be weaker.

The inheritance model looks like this in practice: a tenant's effective evaluation is the union of all floor checks and all ceiling checks, where ceiling checks override floor checks on shared dimensions only if the ceiling threshold is stricter. If the platform floor requires latency under 8 seconds and the tenant's ceiling requires latency under 3 seconds, the effective threshold is 3 seconds. If the platform floor requires safety score above 90 percent and the tenant's ceiling does not mention safety, the effective threshold is 90 percent from the floor. If the platform floor requires basic accuracy above 70 percent and the tenant's ceiling requires accuracy above 95 percent with citation backing, the effective check is the ceiling's more demanding version.

This inheritance model means that every improvement to the platform floor automatically applies to every tenant. When you add a new safety check to the floor — say, a check for personally identifiable information leakage that did not exist before — every tenant's evaluation instantly includes that check without any per-tenant configuration change. The floor is the rising tide that lifts all ships.

## When the Ceiling Contradicts the Floor

In theory, ceilings only extend floors. In practice, contradictions arise — and resolving them is one of the most operationally complex challenges in layered quality architecture.

The most common contradiction occurs in safety filtering. Your platform floor may enforce a safety check that blocks discussion of certain medical procedures in generated content. A healthcare customer's ceiling may explicitly require that the system discuss those procedures, because their use case is clinical decision support for physicians. The floor says "block this content." The ceiling says "generate this content." Both are correct for their respective contexts.

Resolving this requires the concept of **floor exemptions** — documented, audited, per-tenant overrides that allow a specific customer to operate below the platform floor on a specific dimension, with explicit justification and compensating controls. The healthcare customer gets a floor exemption on the medical content safety filter because their use case legitimately requires that content, they have a professional user base (licensed physicians), and they accept liability for the clinical use of generated content through their contract. The exemption is not a removal of the safety check. It is a recalibration — the safety check still applies, but the threshold is adjusted to permit clinically relevant content while still blocking content that is harmful even in a clinical context.

Floor exemptions require governance. They should not be granted by a single engineer or a single customer success manager. They should follow an approval process that includes engineering (to assess technical risk), legal (to assess liability), compliance (to assess regulatory implications), and the customer's own stakeholders (to confirm they accept the adjusted risk profile). The process sounds heavy. It needs to be heavy. Every floor exemption is a point where your platform's universal quality guarantee does not apply, and every such point carries risk. A healthcare platform that granted a safety filter exemption without proper governance, and then had a patient receive inappropriate medical content, would face both regulatory consequences and a contractual dispute over whether the exemption was appropriately scoped.

The exemption registry — a versioned record of all active floor exemptions, their justifications, their approvers, and their review dates — is a compliance artifact that regulated platforms must maintain. It is also a useful engineering artifact: when debugging a tenant's quality issue, the exemption registry tells you which floor checks do and do not apply to that tenant, preventing investigation dead ends where an engineer spends hours trying to understand why a floor check is not triggering for a specific tenant.

## Versioning Floors Without Breaking Ceilings

The floor changes over time. You add new safety checks, raise accuracy thresholds, tighten latency requirements. Each floor change has the potential to break existing ceilings, because ceilings are built on the assumption that the floor stays stable beneath them.

Consider a scenario where your platform floor requires basic accuracy above 70 percent. A customer's ceiling requires accuracy above 95 percent. You raise the floor's accuracy threshold to 80 percent. This change is invisible to the customer because their ceiling already requires 95 percent — the new floor is still below their ceiling. No breakage. Now consider a different scenario: your platform floor adds a new evaluation dimension — say, a chain-of-thought coherence check — that did not previously exist. The customer's ceiling does not include this dimension because it was not available when the ceiling was configured. After the floor update, the customer's eval results now include a dimension they have never seen, scored against a threshold they did not negotiate. Their composite score changes because a new dimension entered the calculation. Their quality reports show a new line item. If the customer's outputs happen to score poorly on this new dimension, their overall quality score drops even though nothing about their configuration or their outputs changed.

The solution is a **floor versioning protocol** that treats floor changes as platform releases with per-tenant impact assessment. Before rolling a floor change to production, the protocol requires computing the impact on every tenant's effective evaluation configuration. For each tenant, the protocol answers: does this floor change affect their composite score? Does it add a new dimension to their evaluation? Does it raise a threshold above their current ceiling? Does it conflict with any active floor exemption?

Tenants whose evaluations are not affected get the new floor immediately. Tenants whose evaluations are affected get a notification period — typically 30 days for non-critical changes, 7 days for safety-related changes — during which their ceiling can be adjusted to accommodate the new floor. During the notification period, the new floor check runs in shadow mode for affected tenants: it is evaluated and logged but does not affect their quality score or SLA compliance. This gives both the platform team and the customer time to understand the impact, adjust ceilings if needed, and avoid surprise score changes.

This protocol mirrors the approach used in API versioning for SaaS platforms — never break existing contracts, give customers time to migrate, and run new behavior in shadow before making it authoritative. The same principles apply when the "API" is a quality standard rather than a code interface.

## Tier-Based Ceiling Complexity

Not every customer needs or pays for the same ceiling complexity. A self-serve customer paying $200 per month should not expect the same per-tenant evaluation granularity as an enterprise customer paying $50,000 per month. Tier-based ceiling complexity aligns the investment you make in per-tenant evaluation with the revenue and strategic importance of each customer.

A typical three-tier structure works as follows. The standard tier gets the platform floor plus a small number of configurable ceiling parameters — perhaps an accuracy threshold, a latency requirement, and a preferred output format. These parameters are set through a self-serve interface, require no human approval, and are evaluated automatically. The eval infrastructure investment per standard-tier customer is minimal: one additional threshold check, one additional format validation, no custom judge prompts, no custom rubric dimensions.

The professional tier gets everything in standard plus moderate ceiling customization — custom quality dimensions with customer-defined weights, customer-specific golden sets for calibration, and monthly quality reports with dimension-level breakdowns. These configurations require a customer success manager to set up and validate, typically during onboarding. The eval infrastructure investment per professional-tier customer is moderate: additional judge prompts for custom dimensions, golden set storage and calibration runs, and reporting infrastructure.

The enterprise tier gets full ceiling customization — custom judge prompts, custom rubric dimensions, customer-provided evaluation data, regulatory compliance checks, floor exemptions when justified, dedicated evaluation cadence, and real-time quality dashboards. These configurations require a solutions engineer to design and a customer success manager to maintain. The eval infrastructure investment per enterprise-tier customer is significant: dedicated compute for their eval runs, custom judge prompt development, compliance check integration, and per-tenant dashboard infrastructure.

The key architectural principle is that tier differences should be configuration differences, not code differences. The same eval pipeline processes all tiers. The difference is how many dimensions are active, how many custom elements are loaded, and how frequently the eval runs. A standard-tier customer and an enterprise-tier customer flow through the same pipeline — the pipeline just does more work for the enterprise customer because their ceiling configuration includes more elements.

## The Floor-Ceiling Contract in Reporting

The layered architecture must be visible in customer-facing quality reports. A customer should see both their floor results and their ceiling results, clearly distinguished, because the two layers serve different purposes.

Floor results tell the customer: your outputs meet the platform's universal safety and quality standards. This is the baseline trust signal. It says "nothing catastrophically wrong happened." Floor results are typically binary per dimension — passed or did not pass — because the floor represents minimum thresholds, not quality gradients.

Ceiling results tell the customer: here is how your outputs performed against your specific quality definition. This is the value signal. It says "here is how well the platform is serving your particular needs." Ceiling results are typically scored on a continuous scale per dimension — citation fidelity at 88 percent, brand voice alignment at 92 percent, numerical accuracy at 97 percent — because the ceiling represents quality targets that the customer tracks over time.

Separating floor and ceiling results in reports prevents a common confusion: a customer seeing a high composite score and assuming everything is fine when a floor-level safety check narrowly passed. It also prevents the inverse confusion: a customer seeing a low composite score and panicking when the issue is a single ceiling dimension that dipped, while all floor-level checks are solidly passing. The layered report gives the customer the full picture — universal standards met, customer-specific standards tracked — and enables productive conversations about where to invest in improvement.

This reporting architecture connects directly to the customer evidence packages discussed in Chapter 7, where quality reports become contractual artifacts that demonstrate SLA compliance. The floor-ceiling distinction in reporting is not just a UX choice. It is a legal structure that separates "is the platform safe and functional" from "is the platform meeting this customer's specific quality commitments." When a quality dispute escalates, the distinction matters enormously.

The next subchapter introduces the Tenant Drift Detector — the monitoring system that watches each customer's quality over time and catches per-tenant degradation before the customer does, even when platform-wide metrics remain stable.
