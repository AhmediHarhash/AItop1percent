# Chapter 4 — Configuration-Aware Evaluation and Per-Tenant Monitoring

Every tenant runs a different version of your product. Different prompts, different model selections, different retrieval configurations, different adapter weights, different tool access. The platform that evaluates its default configuration instead of each tenant's actual configuration is measuring a product that no customer actually uses. When two hundred customers each run a slightly different setup, and your eval suite only tests the baseline, you have two hundred untested products in production.

This chapter covers configuration-aware evaluation — the practice of ensuring that every eval reflects the specific setup each customer actually runs — and per-tenant monitoring, the system that catches quality degradation for individual customers even when platform-wide metrics look stable. You will learn how to map configuration spaces, detect tenant-specific drift, design per-tenant dashboards and alerts, and evaluate the bridge model architecture where per-tenant adapters interact with shared base models.

*You cannot monitor what you do not measure, and you cannot measure what you do not configure. The next subchapter reveals the most common blind spot in multi-tenant evaluation.*
