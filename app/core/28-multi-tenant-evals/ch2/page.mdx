# Chapter 2 — Customer-Specific Quality Definitions and Rubrics

"Good" is not a universal constant. The healthcare enterprise that needs conservative, citation-backed responses and the e-commerce marketplace that needs fast, creative product descriptions are both running on your platform — and they both expect quality, but they mean completely different things by it. The eval system that uses one rubric for both will satisfy neither.

This chapter covers the hardest conceptual challenge in multi-tenant evaluation: defining, parameterizing, and maintaining per-customer quality standards at scale. You will learn how to build quality contracts, create tenant-scoped golden sets, calibrate judges per customer, and evolve quality definitions as customers mature — all without writing per-customer code that becomes unmaintainable at a hundred accounts.

*Before you can evaluate quality for a customer, you need to know what quality means to that customer. The next subchapter shows you how to build that definition into a contract that both engineering and the customer can hold each other to.*
