# Chapter 8 — Organizational Patterns and the Multi-Tenant Eval Maturity Model

The hardest part of multi-tenant evaluation is not the technology. It is the organizational design: who owns per-customer quality, how teams scale from ten customers to five hundred, how escalation works when a tier-one customer and a tier-three customer both have quality incidents at the same time, and how to mature from reactive firefighting to proactive quality operations. The platforms that solve the technology but not the organization end up with eval systems that work in theory and fail in practice because nobody owns the space between "platform team" and "customer success."

This chapter covers the people side of multi-tenant evaluation: centralized versus federated team structures, the interface between eval teams and customer success, lifecycle event handling, the organizational breaking points that appear at scale, self-service eval capabilities, and the five-level maturity model that takes a platform from one-eval-for-all to autonomous per-customer quality.

*Technology scales automatically. Organizations do not. The next subchapter shows why the team structure that works for twenty customers breaks at a hundred.*
