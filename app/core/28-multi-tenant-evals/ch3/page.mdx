# Chapter 3 — Tenant Isolation in Evaluation Systems

The most dangerous failure in multi-tenant AI is not low quality for one customer. It is data, context, or evaluation results leaking between customers. A healthcare enterprise discovers that their patient interaction samples appeared in another tenant's eval report. A financial services client learns that their proprietary scoring rubric was used to calibrate judges for a competitor. These are not hypothetical scenarios. They are the incidents that end contracts, trigger regulatory investigations, and destroy platform trust permanently.

This chapter covers isolation as an existential requirement — enforced at every layer from data storage to compute scheduling to the legal jurisdiction where evaluation jobs run. You will learn how to build, test, and prove isolation boundaries that hold under pressure, including the subtle contamination vectors that most teams miss entirely.

*Isolation is not a feature you add later. It is the foundation you build everything else on. The next subchapter shows what happens when that foundation cracks.*
