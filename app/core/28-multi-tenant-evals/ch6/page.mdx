# Chapter 6 — Multi-Tenant Release Gates, Adapter Lifecycle, and Cross-Customer Impact

In single-tenant systems, a release either passes or fails. In multi-tenant systems, the same release can pass for three hundred customers, fail for twenty, and violate contractual SLAs for five. When per-tenant adapters are involved — the bridge model architecture where a shared base model serves hundreds of customers through per-tenant LoRA adapters — the interaction between base model updates and adapter weights creates failure modes that single-tenant systems never encounter. A base model improvement can silently degrade every adapter trained against the old weights.

This chapter covers release management in multi-tenant environments: blast radius prediction, staged rollouts across customer tiers, adapter lifecycle management, cross-adapter interference, rollback complexity, and the notification problem of telling customers what changed and why.

*Every release in a multi-tenant system is a bet placed simultaneously on hundreds of customers. The next subchapter shows what happens when that bet goes wrong for the five that matter most.*
