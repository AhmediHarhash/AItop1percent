# 7.11 — SLA Clock Management During and After Incidents

The SLA clock does not stop because you are working hard. It runs during detection, during mitigation, during recovery. By the time traffic is restored, you may have already burned through your monthly error budget.

A contract analysis platform running Gemini 3 Pro promised 99.9% uptime, which allows 43 minutes of downtime per month. They had a 67-minute outage in January 2026. By the time they restored service, they had exceeded their monthly SLA by 24 minutes. They owed credits to 340 customers totaling 89,000 dollars. The finance team was not notified until five days later when customers started requesting credits. The incident was resolved from an engineering perspective, but the SLA impact cascaded into billing, customer success, and executive reporting.

SLA management is part of incident recovery. You need to measure SLA impact accurately during the incident, report it promptly, and manage customer expectations before they escalate.

## SLA Measurement During Incidents

SLAs are measured by availability, not effort. If your system is down for 60 minutes, the SLA clock runs for 60 minutes regardless of how many engineers worked on it or how quickly you responded. A healthcare appointment scheduler had a 90-minute incident but argued internally that only 40 minutes should count against SLAs because they detected and started mitigating within 15 minutes. Customers disagreed. The SLA counted 90 minutes. The argument created internal conflict and delayed credit processing.

Availability is measured from the user perspective, not the monitoring system perspective. A customer service chatbot had monitoring that showed the system was "available" because health checks were passing, but users could not submit queries due to a routing misconfiguration. The incident lasted 50 minutes. Engineering initially reported zero SLA impact because health checks were green. Customer Success reported 50 minutes of unavailability because users could not use the service. Customer Success was correct. SLAs are user-facing.

Measure SLA impact in real time during the incident. Do not wait until the post-mortem. A recruiting platform had an SLA dashboard visible in the incident war room. As the incident progressed, the dashboard showed cumulative SLA impact, remaining error budget for the month, and projected credit liability. This made SLA impact visible to decision-makers while decisions could still reduce user impact.

## Downtime vs Degradation Accounting

Full downtime is straightforward: the system is unavailable, the SLA clock runs at 100%. Degraded availability is more complex. If your system is partially available, how do you account for SLA impact?

A legal research assistant had an SLA that defined availability as "able to process queries with P95 latency under 5 seconds." During an incident, the system remained online but P95 latency reached 18 seconds. The system was degraded, not down. How much SLA impact? The team counted it as 100% downtime because users could not get responses within the SLA threshold. Customers agreed. Degraded performance that violates SLA definitions counts as unavailability.

Some SLAs include partial credit for degraded service. A financial modeling platform had an SLA that defined three availability tiers: full availability (P95 latency under 3 seconds), degraded availability (P95 latency 3-10 seconds), and unavailable (P95 latency over 10 seconds or error rate above 5%). Degraded availability counted as 50% downtime for SLA purposes. During a 40-minute incident with degraded performance, the SLA impact was 20 minutes. This nuance was contractually defined and measured automatically.

If your SLA does not define degradation accounting, default to the user perspective. If users experienced impact, it counts. A content moderation system had an incident where 30% of requests failed but 70% succeeded. They initially counted it as 30% downtime. Customers who were in the affected 30% argued that their experience was 100% downtime. The team revised their accounting to count degraded incidents as full downtime unless the degradation was minor and contractually defined.

## Partial Availability Credits

When SLA breaches occur, credits are owed. Credit calculation depends on SLA terms. A typical SLA for 99.9% uptime might offer 10% monthly credit for availability below 99.9%, 25% credit for availability below 99%, and 50% credit for availability below 95%. A 67-minute outage in a 43,800-minute month is 99.847% availability, which triggers a 10% credit.

Credits are calculated per customer, not globally. A SaaS platform had a regional outage that affected only customers in Europe. They calculated SLA credits only for affected customers, not the entire customer base. This reduced credit liability from 450,000 dollars to 120,000 dollars. SLA terms should specify whether credits apply globally or per affected customer.

Some customers negotiate custom SLAs. A healthcare documentation system had 15 enterprise customers with custom SLA terms ranging from 99.5% to 99.95%. During an incident, SLA impact varied by customer. Some customers had no breach. Others exceeded thresholds and were owed credits. The team maintained a per-customer SLA tracking sheet that calculated impact automatically during incidents.

Proactive credit issuance is better than waiting for customers to request credits. A customer service chatbot issued SLA credits within 48 hours of any SLA breach without requiring customer requests. Customer satisfaction remained high even during incidents because the company acknowledged impact immediately. Waiting for customers to notice and request credits creates friction and damages trust.

## SLA Reporting to Customers

Notify customers of SLA breaches as soon as impact is calculated, typically within 24-48 hours of incident resolution. The notification should include what happened, how long the incident lasted, the SLA impact, and what credits will be applied. A travel booking assistant sent SLA breach notifications within 24 hours of every incident. The message included a timeline, the specific SLA metric that was breached, and confirmation that credits would appear on the next invoice.

Transparency builds trust. A legal document generator had an incident that caused 55 minutes of downtime. They sent a detailed email explaining the root cause, the SLA impact (99.874% availability, below 99.9% threshold), and the 10% monthly credit being applied. Customers appreciated the transparency. Several responded thanking the team for the clear communication.

Do not hide SLA breaches. Customers will notice. Usage logs show downtime. Support tickets show complaints. If you do not report it, customers will ask, and the delayed acknowledgment damages credibility more than the incident itself. A recruiting platform tried to avoid reporting a 30-minute incident that technically breached their SLA. Three customers noticed and escalated to account managers. The resulting trust damage was worse than the incident.

If the incident affected only certain customer segments, notify only affected customers. A financial advisory platform had an incident that affected customers using a specific feature. They sent SLA notifications only to customers who had used that feature in the past 30 days. Broader notification would have alarmed customers who experienced no impact.

## Internal SLA Tracking

Track SLAs internally even if they are not customer-facing. Internal SLAs create accountability. A content moderation system had an internal SLA for their ML pipeline: 99.5% uptime for model inference, P99 latency under 2 seconds. When incidents breached internal SLAs, the team conducted post-mortems and tracked trends. This discipline prevented customer-facing SLA breaches by catching internal issues early.

Maintain an SLA dashboard visible to leadership. A healthcare appointment scheduler had a real-time SLA dashboard showing current month availability, remaining error budget, and projected year-end SLA performance. During incidents, leadership could see SLA impact immediately and make resourcing decisions accordingly. When error budget was exhausted, additional incidents required executive approval to accept SLA breach risk.

Track SLA trends over time. A customer service chatbot tracked monthly SLA performance for two years. They identified patterns: incidents were more frequent during model deployment windows, and SLA breaches clustered in Q4 due to holiday traffic spikes. These insights drove infrastructure investment and deployment policy changes that improved SLA performance year over year.

## SLA Breach Communication

Communicate SLA breaches to internal stakeholders immediately. Engineering, Product, Customer Success, Sales, Finance, and Leadership all need to know. A legal research assistant had a protocol: any incident exceeding 30 minutes triggered an automatic SLA breach notification to a cross-functional Slack channel. This ensured no team was surprised when customers started asking questions.

Customer Success needs detailed SLA impact data to handle customer conversations. A recruiting platform provided Customer Success with per-customer SLA impact reports within 12 hours of any incident. The report included which customers were affected, how long the impact lasted, what credit percentage applied, and a customer-facing explanation of what happened. Customer Success could proactively reach out to affected customers with full context.

Finance needs credit liability data for revenue recognition and forecasting. A financial modeling platform had a process where SLA credit totals were reported to Finance within 48 hours of any breach. Finance adjusted revenue forecasts and ensured credits were applied correctly on invoices. This prevented billing errors that would have required additional customer outreach.

## Negotiating SLA Adjustments

Some enterprise customers negotiate SLA adjustments after major incidents. A healthcare documentation system had a 4-hour outage that breached SLAs for 50 enterprise customers. Three customers requested extended credit beyond contractual terms. The company negotiated case-by-case. Two customers received additional service credits. One customer received an upgraded support tier for three months. Flexibility preserved relationships that rigid adherence to contract terms would have damaged.

SLA renegotiation sometimes follows repeated incidents. A contract analysis platform had three SLA breaches in four months. Several customers requested contract amendments with stricter SLA terms and higher penalties. The company agreed, then invested in infrastructure to meet the new terms. The customer pressure drove reliability improvements that benefited everyone.

Do not offer SLA adjustments that you cannot sustain. A travel booking assistant offered a 99.99% SLA to close a large deal. They could not consistently meet it. Over six months, they breached the SLA four times and paid significant credits. The customer remained dissatisfied. The account churned. Overpromising SLAs creates a cycle of failure and dissatisfaction.

## SLA Clock as a Learning Tool

SLA breaches are feedback. If you breach SLAs repeatedly, your reliability targets do not match your operational reality. A customer service chatbot breached their 99.9% SLA three times in five months. After the third breach, they revised their SLA to 99.5%, invested in infrastructure, and after six months, upgraded back to 99.9% once they had proven sustained reliability. Temporary SLA reduction was more honest than repeated breaches.

Track error budget consumption as a leading indicator. If you are consuming error budget faster than expected, you are on track for SLA breaches. A legal document generator tracked weekly error budget consumption. When they consumed 50% of their monthly budget in the first week, they implemented a change freeze and increased monitoring sensitivity. This prevented additional incidents that would have caused SLA breaches.

SLA management is not just about credits and compliance. It is about trust. Users need to know you will be available when they depend on you. When you are not, they need to know you will acknowledge it, compensate fairly, and fix the underlying issue. Teams that treat SLAs as bureaucratic obligations miss the point. Teams that treat SLAs as trust contracts build lasting customer relationships.

The next step after SLA accounting is measuring how well you recover. The next subchapter covers recovery metrics, how to track them, and how to improve recovery performance over time.
