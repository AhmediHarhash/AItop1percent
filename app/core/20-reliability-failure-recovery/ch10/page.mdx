# Chapter 10 — SLAs, SLOs, and Reliability Economics

Reliability is not free, and not all reliability is worth buying. Traditional software reliability focuses on uptime — did the service respond or not? AI systems add a second dimension that makes reliability far more expensive: the answer might be technically delivered but functionally useless. A chatbot that responds instantly with hallucinated medical advice is worse than one that times out. A fraud detection system that returns "suspicious" for every transaction is up but worthless. This chapter teaches how to measure, promise, and invest in AI system reliability when the definition of "working" includes quality, not just availability.

*The hardest question in AI reliability is not "is it up?" but "what are we promising, and how much are we willing to pay to keep that promise?"*
