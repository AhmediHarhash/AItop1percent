# Chapter 14 — Reliability Maturity and Continuous Improvement

Reliability is not a destination. It is not something you achieve once and then move on. It is a discipline, a set of practices, a cultural mindset that evolves as your organization grows. The team that reaches world-class reliability does not start there. They progress through clear stages — from reactive firefighting to systematic prevention — and they do so deliberately, investing in the right capabilities at the right time.

This chapter defines the AI reliability maturity model and shows you how to use it. You will assess where your organization stands today, understand what the next level requires, and build a roadmap for continuous improvement that matches your business needs and growth stage.

*Reliability maturity is not measured by what you say you care about. It is measured by what breaks, how quickly you know, and how systematically you prevent it from breaking again.*
