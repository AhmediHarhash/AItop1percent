# 7.8 — User Re-Engagement After Outages

Your AI system is back online. Traffic is flowing. Metrics look normal. But where are all your users?

A customer service platform running GPT-5 experienced a 90-minute outage in November 2025. Within 20 minutes of recovery, only 40% of pre-outage traffic had returned. Two hours later, they were still at 68% of normal volume. The next day, usage was down 15%. The problem was not technical. Users who hit an outage often do not come back automatically. They switch to alternatives, complete tasks manually, or simply wait. Some never return.

The team assumed users would flood back once the system was healthy. They were wrong. Recovery is not just about restoring service. It is about re-engaging users who experienced failure and may no longer trust your system.

## The User Psychology of Outages

When your AI system fails, users make immediate decisions. They switch to a competitor. They use a manual process. They delay the task. They tell colleagues not to use your tool. Each decision creates inertia. The longer the outage, the stronger the inertia. A 10-minute outage causes minor inconvenience. A 90-minute outage causes users to adapt. They find workarounds. They change workflows. They update their mental model of your system from "reliable" to "sometimes down."

Re-engagement is fighting that inertia. You need to give users a reason to come back, and you need to do it quickly. The first 24 hours after recovery are critical. Users who do not return within a day are significantly less likely to return at all.

The e-commerce company that lost 23% of users after a pricing model outage did not send a single re-engagement message. They assumed the service being online was enough. Users assumed the problem might happen again and stayed with manual processes. Three weeks later, usage was still 18% below baseline. They never fully recovered.

## Proactive Re-Engagement Communication

Do not wait for users to discover your system is back. Tell them. A healthcare documentation system sent targeted emails to users who had active sessions during an outage, notifying them that the service was restored and their work was preserved. Re-engagement within 4 hours was 87%. Users who did not receive the email took an average of 19 hours to return, and 12% did not return at all that week.

The message matters. Do not send a generic "we're back" announcement. Tell users what happened, what was fixed, and what you are doing to prevent recurrence. Acknowledge the inconvenience. If the outage was severe, offer something tangible: service credits, extended trial periods, access to premium features. Users who feel compensated are more likely to give you another chance.

A contract analysis platform running Claude Opus 4.5 offered users who were active during a 75-minute outage one month of free premium access. Re-engagement within 24 hours was 94%, compared to 61% for users who received only a status update. The cost of the credits was 8,000 dollars. The cost of losing those users permanently would have been 340,000 dollars in annual recurring revenue.

## Session Restoration for Interrupted Users

Users who were mid-task when your system failed face the highest friction to return. They lost context. They lost work. They lost trust. Session restoration reduces that friction. When the user returns, the system should restore their state as closely as possible: the document they were editing, the query they were running, the conversation thread they were in.

A legal research assistant preserved conversation state during a 40-minute outage caused by a model routing failure. When users returned, the system displayed their last three queries and offered to re-run them. 81% of returning users resumed their session immediately. Without restoration, users typically spend 4-6 minutes reorienting themselves or abandon the task entirely.

Session restoration requires state management infrastructure. You need to persist user context outside the primary service: the user's input history, the documents they accessed, the parameters they set. This data should survive service restarts and failovers. The investment pays for itself in the first major incident.

## Timing and Channels for Re-Engagement

Send the first message within 30 minutes of confirmed recovery. Do not wait until you have a full post-mortem. Users need to know the service is available now, not why it failed. A financial advisory platform sent re-engagement emails 6 hours after recovery. By then, 40% of users had already moved tasks to the next day or used alternative tools. Early communication would have captured them.

Use multiple channels. Email reaches users who left your platform. In-app banners reach users who are checking if you are back. Push notifications reach mobile users. SMS reaches users for whom the service is mission-critical. A customer support system used all four channels for a high-severity outage. Email had 34% open rate, in-app banners had 67% interaction rate, push notifications had 19% click-through, and SMS had 52% response. Each channel reached different user segments.

Do not spam. One message per channel is enough. If the outage affected only certain features, target only the users who use those features. A code generation tool running Codex-Max notified only users who had active coding sessions, not the entire user base. Precision reduced noise and increased trust.

## Measuring Re-Engagement Success

Track re-engagement rate: the percentage of active users in the hour before the outage who return within 24 hours. Track time to return: how long it takes users to come back. Track retention: the percentage of users who remain active 7 days and 30 days after the incident. These metrics tell you how effectively you recovered user trust, not just service availability.

A content moderation system measured re-engagement across three incidents. After the first incident, re-engagement was 71% within 24 hours and 88% within a week. After the second incident with better communication, re-engagement was 84% within 24 hours and 94% within a week. After the third incident with communication and service credits, re-engagement was 92% within 24 hours and 98% within a week. Each improvement in re-engagement strategy showed measurable impact.

Compare re-engagement metrics to your baseline churn rate. If users who experienced an outage churn at higher rates than your baseline, your re-engagement strategy is not working. A SaaS platform found that users who experienced an outage had 2.4 times higher churn over the next 90 days. They implemented proactive re-engagement with compensation and reduced the multiplier to 1.1 times baseline churn.

## Long-Term Trust Recovery

One successful re-engagement does not restore trust. Users remember outages. If your system fails again within weeks, even a minor incident compounds the damage. A translation service had three outages in five weeks. By the third incident, re-engagement within 24 hours dropped to 54%, down from 79% after the first incident. Users stop giving you the benefit of the doubt.

Trust recovery requires consistent reliability over time. After a major incident, your system needs to run flawlessly for at least 60 days before users fully reset their mental model. Communicate reliability improvements visibly: publish uptime metrics, share reliability investments, announce new redundancy layers. Show users you took the incident seriously.

A recruiting platform experienced a 4-hour outage in August 2025 that affected 3,000 customers. They implemented automated failover, added regional redundancy, and published a detailed incident report with the technical fixes. Over the next 90 days, they had zero outages. By November, user surveys showed trust scores had returned to pre-incident levels. Transparency plus sustained reliability rebuilt what the outage damaged.

Re-engagement is not a one-time task. It is the bridge between technical recovery and trust recovery. Your system being online is necessary but not sufficient. Users need to know it is online, need a reason to come back, and need evidence that you will not let them down again. The teams that invest in re-engagement recover faster and lose fewer users permanently.

The stabilization period after recovery is critical. The next subchapter covers the re-failure pattern, where systems fail again shortly after recovery and why extended monitoring is not optional.
