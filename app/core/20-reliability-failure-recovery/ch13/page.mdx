# Chapter 13 — Trust, Reputation, and Organizational Survival

AI failures are reputational multipliers. A model that hallucinates medical advice, generates biased hiring recommendations, or produces offensive content does not just fail technically — it fails publicly, permanently, and at scale. Every interaction is screenshot-ready. Every mistake can go viral. Every incident becomes part of your brand narrative for years.

This chapter covers the reputational dimension of AI reliability — why AI failures spread faster than traditional software bugs, how to manage public disclosure when models fail, what it takes to rebuild trust after a hallucination incident, and how to prevent the next viral screenshot that defines your company in ways you never intended.
