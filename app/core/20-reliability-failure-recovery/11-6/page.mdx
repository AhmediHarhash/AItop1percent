# 11.6 — Follow-the-Sun Models for Global AI Systems

Why do overnight on-call rotations exist? Because systems fail at all hours, and someone needs to be available to respond. But here is the question no one asks until they have burned through three engineers in six months: what if your team was distributed across enough time zones that someone was always awake during their normal working hours, and no one had to wake up at 3am?

A fintech company with AI-powered fraud detection ran a traditional on-call rotation from their San Francisco headquarters for two years. Every engineer took a week of 24/7 on-call every six weeks. They were paged an average of three times per week, two of those between midnight and 6am. The pages were not always incidents — sometimes they were alerts that needed investigation, sometimes they were degradations that could wait until morning but looked urgent enough to wake someone. The team had 40% annual turnover. Exit interviews said the same thing: the on-call load was unsustainable.

In 2025, they opened an engineering office in Berlin and another in Singapore. They transitioned to a follow-the-sun model. The Berlin team covered European daytime hours, the San Francisco team covered Americas hours, the Singapore team covered Asia-Pacific hours. Each team worked their normal day. No one was on call overnight. Turnover dropped to 12%. The system was still monitored 24/7, incidents still got handled immediately, but the engineers were awake and functioning at full capacity when they responded.

## What Follow-the-Sun Means

Follow-the-sun coverage means distributing your team across time zones so that normal working hours in one location overlap with the end of the day in another and the beginning of the day in a third. As one region finishes their day, they hand off responsibility to the next region starting theirs. The sun is always shining somewhere on your team, and whoever the sun is shining on is the one handling incidents.

This is not the same as having a small on-call rotation where one person in each region is on call all the time. Follow-the-sun means the entire regional team shares responsibility during their working hours. If an incident happens at 10am Berlin time, any engineer in Berlin can respond. The load is distributed across the whole team, not concentrated on whoever is on call that week.

For AI systems, follow-the-sun works particularly well because many AI incidents require investigation, experimentation, and coordination with other teams. You need engineers who are alert, who can think clearly, and who can involve product or legal or support if needed. An engineer woken up at 2am can restart a service or roll back a deploy, but they cannot effectively debug why a fine-tuned model suddenly started producing biased outputs. That kind of investigation requires cognitive capacity that you do not have in the middle of the night.

## Regional Coverage Requirements

Effective follow-the-sun requires at least three regions with enough overlap that handoffs are smooth. The classic setup is Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Americas covers roughly 9am to 6pm Pacific Time, Europe covers roughly 9am to 6pm Central European Time, Asia-Pacific covers roughly 9am to 6pm Singapore or Sydney time. Together, these three regions provide 24-hour coverage with a few hours of overlap between each.

The overlap is critical. During the overlap, both regions are online. The outgoing region can brief the incoming region on anything important, answer questions, and ensure nothing is dropped. Without overlap, you have gaps where no one is clearly responsible, or you have abrupt handoffs where the incoming region has no context.

Each region needs enough engineers to handle the normal load during their hours without burning out. If your AI system sees incidents or degradations that require engineering attention a few times per week, each region needs at least three to four engineers who can respond. If the load is higher, you need more. The goal is not to have one hero in each region — the goal is to distribute the work so that no individual is overwhelmed.

Each region also needs the authority to make decisions. They cannot be dependent on approvals from a team that is asleep. If the APAC team sees a degradation in model quality at 2am San Francisco time, they need to be able to roll back a deploy, adjust a threshold, or fail over to a backup model without waiting for someone in the US to wake up and approve it. Follow-the-sun only works if each region is empowered to act.

## Handoff Procedures Across Time Zones

The handoff is where follow-the-sun either works or falls apart. A good handoff takes ten minutes and ensures the incoming region knows everything they need to know. A bad handoff leaves the incoming region discovering problems that the outgoing region knew about but did not mention.

The handoff happens in a shared channel or a scheduled handoff call. The outgoing region summarizes the last 24 hours: any incidents that occurred and how they were resolved, any ongoing issues that need attention, any changes that were deployed, any alerts that fired but were determined to be non-issues, and any context the incoming region should have. If an investigation is ongoing but not urgent, the outgoing region documents where they left off so the incoming region can pick it up.

The incoming region reviews the handoff, asks questions, and confirms they understand. If something is unclear, they ask now, while the outgoing region is still available. The outgoing region does not disappear the moment they hand off — they stay available for 15 to 30 minutes during the overlap in case questions come up.

The handoff document is persistent. It is not a Slack message that scrolls away. It is a shared doc or a wiki page that each region updates at the end of their shift. The incoming region reads it, the outgoing region confirms it is accurate, and everyone has a single source of truth for what is happening across the 24-hour cycle.

## Knowledge Sharing Across Regions

The hardest part of follow-the-sun is ensuring that knowledge does not fragment. The Americas team learns something about how the embeddings cache behaves under load, but the APAC team never hears about it. The Europe team builds a new runbook for handling hallucination incidents, but the Americas team keeps using the old process. Over time, the regions diverge in their understanding of the system, their tools, and their practices. Incidents get handled inconsistently. Quality degrades.

Preventing fragmentation requires deliberate knowledge sharing. Every incident gets a written post-incident review that all regions read. Every runbook update is announced in a shared channel. Every new tool or script is added to a shared repository. Every significant change to the AI system — a new model, a new prompt, a new evaluation threshold — is documented and communicated to all regions.

Weekly or bi-weekly sync meetings with representatives from all regions ensure everyone is aligned. These meetings are not status updates — they are knowledge-sharing sessions. One region walks through a recent incident and what they learned. Another region demos a new debugging tool they built. A third region shares patterns they are seeing in alerts and asks if other regions are seeing the same. The goal is to keep the global team operating as one team, not three isolated teams.

Time zones make these meetings hard. No time works well for everyone. Rotate the meeting time so the burden is shared. One week it is at a time that is convenient for Americas and Europe but awkward for APAC. The next week it is convenient for APAC and Americas but awkward for Europe. No one should bear the burden of middle-of-the-night meetings every week.

## Handling Incidents That Span Handoffs

Some incidents do not resolve within one region's working hours. An incident starts at 4pm Pacific Time, the Americas team works it for two hours, and at 6pm they hand off to APAC with the incident still ongoing. The APAC team picks it up, investigates further, tries additional mitigations, and at the end of their day they hand it back to Europe, still unresolved. These long-running incidents are where follow-the-sun is most vulnerable to information loss.

The outgoing region must document everything they tried, everything they learned, and the current state of the incident. Not a summary — the full context. Which logs they checked, which hypotheses they ruled out, which mitigations they tried and what the results were, what they believe the root cause is, and what they planned to try next. This goes into the incident document, and the incoming region reads it before taking over.

The handoff for an ongoing incident includes a synchronous briefing. The outgoing region does not just write the document and leave. They talk to the incoming region, answer questions, and make sure the incoming region understands the full context. The incident commander role may transfer to someone in the incoming region, or the original incident commander may stay involved across regions, awake during their off-hours to maintain continuity. This depends on severity and how long the incident has been running.

For critical incidents that span multiple regions, consider keeping key people from the original region available even after their normal hours. Not for the full shift — but for a few hours into the handoff to ensure continuity. This is not sustainable as a regular practice, but for the occasional multi-region incident it prevents the loss of critical context.

## Regional Expertise Specialization

Over time, regions often develop specialized expertise based on the users they support and the incidents they handle most often. The APAC team might become experts in handling incidents related to Mandarin and Japanese language outputs because those are the languages their users speak. The Europe team might become specialists in GDPR-related data handling because European regulations are stricter. The Americas team might develop deep expertise in the fraud detection model because the highest volume of fraud attempts happens during US hours.

This specialization is a feature, not a bug. It increases the depth of expertise across the global team. But it also creates risk — if only the APAC team knows how to debug CJK language issues, what happens when a CJK issue arises during Americas hours?

Mitigate this by rotating engineers across regions for short periods. An engineer from Americas spends a month embedded with the APAC team, learns their expertise, and brings it back. An engineer from Europe spends time with Americas, learns their fraud detection knowledge, and shares it with the Europe team. These rotations are expensive and disruptive, but they prevent knowledge from becoming siloed.

Document specialized knowledge in runbooks that all regions can access. If the APAC team has a procedure for handling language-specific hallucinations, write it down so the other regions can follow it. If the Europe team has a checklist for GDPR-sensitive incidents, share it globally. The goal is not for every engineer to be an expert in everything — the goal is for every engineer to know where to find the knowledge when they need it.

## Tools for Follow-the-Sun Teams

Follow-the-sun teams need tools that work asynchronously and maintain shared state. Slack or similar chat platforms for communication, with channels that all regions monitor. Shared incident documentation — a wiki, a Google Doc, a structured incident management system — that tracks ongoing incidents and historical context. Shared runbooks that document procedures, escalation paths, and known issues. Shared dashboards that show the current state of the system in real time.

The tools must not require synchronous coordination. The incoming region should be able to understand the state of the system by reading the handoff doc and checking the dashboards. They should not need to wait for someone to wake up and explain what is happening.

Alerting systems need to route to the correct region based on time of day. An alert that fires at 10am Pacific Time should page the Americas team. The same alert firing at 10pm Pacific Time should page the APAC team. This requires integrating your alerting system with your on-call schedule or using a tool that understands regional coverage.

Video call tools need to work across regions. The weekly sync meeting, the incident handoffs, the post-incident reviews — these all require reliable video conferencing that works in every region with acceptable latency and quality. Test your tools across regions before you need them during an incident.

## When Follow-the-Sun Does Not Work

Follow-the-sun is not a universal solution. It requires enough scale to justify engineering teams in three regions. If your total AI engineering team is five people, you cannot split them across three continents and have effective coverage anywhere. Follow-the-sun makes sense when you have at least ten to fifteen engineers, enough to put three to five in each region.

It also requires a system architecture where regional teams can operate independently. If every decision requires coordination with a centralized team, if the system is too complex for any one region to understand fully, or if the tooling and access controls are region-specific, follow-the-sun creates more problems than it solves. The system must be designed for distributed operations.

Follow-the-sun does not eliminate on-call entirely. You still need escalation paths for incidents that exceed the on-shift team's ability to handle. You still need someone senior who can be contacted outside their normal hours for critical decisions. But it reduces the frequency and intensity of overnight pages dramatically, making on-call sustainable.

For smaller teams, for systems that do not justify global distribution, or for organizations early in their AI journey, a traditional on-call rotation may still be the right answer. Follow-the-sun is an optimization for scale, not a requirement for success.
