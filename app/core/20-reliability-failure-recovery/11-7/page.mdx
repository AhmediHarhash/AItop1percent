# 11.7 — Reliability Team Structures: Embedded vs Centralized

The VP of Engineering looked at the latest reliability metrics and saw a pattern. The customer service AI team had 99.97% uptime, sophisticated monitoring, automated rollback, and incident response times under five minutes. The recommendations AI team had 99.4% uptime, basic monitoring, manual rollback procedures, and incident response times over an hour. Both teams had the same headcount. Both teams had capable engineers. The difference was that the customer service team had hired a dedicated reliability engineer six months ago, and the recommendations team had not.

The question was what to do about it. Should every product team hire their own reliability engineer? That would be expensive, and many teams were too small to justify a full-time reliability person. Should they create a centralized reliability team that supported all product teams? That could work, but would a centralized team understand each product deeply enough to be effective? Should they do something in between — embed reliability engineers in the largest teams and have a central team for everyone else?

There is no universal answer. The right structure depends on your company size, your product architecture, your team culture, and your stage of organizational maturity. But the question is not optional. If you do not decide how to organize for reliability, you get the worst outcome by default — some teams invest in it and others do not, reliability becomes inconsistent across the company, and incidents become more frequent and more severe in the teams that lack expertise.

## The Embedded Model

In the embedded model, reliability engineers sit within product teams. A product team building a customer-facing AI feature has a product manager, five software engineers, a designer, and a reliability engineer. The reliability engineer is part of the team, attends the team's standups and planning meetings, reports to the same engineering manager, and is evaluated on the reliability of that specific product.

The advantage is deep product knowledge. The reliability engineer understands the system intimately because they work on it every day. They know how the model is trained, how the prompts are structured, how the cache works, where the performance bottlenecks are. They do not need to ramp up when an incident happens — they already know the system. They can proactively identify reliability risks because they are present during design discussions, code reviews, and architecture decisions. They catch problems before they reach production because they are embedded in the team's workflow.

The embedded reliability engineer builds the monitoring, writes the runbooks, designs the fallback strategies, and responds to incidents for that product. They also influence how the product is built. They push back on architecture decisions that create reliability risk. They advocate for engineering time to improve observability, reduce complexity, or address technical debt that threatens uptime. Because they are part of the team, their voice carries weight.

The disadvantage is duplication and inconsistency. Each team builds its own monitoring stack, its own alerting rules, its own incident response procedures. The customer service AI team uses one set of tools, the recommendations AI team uses different tools, the fraud detection AI team uses yet another set. When an incident spans multiple systems, coordinating the response is harder because each team operates differently. When a new reliability engineer joins the company, they cannot transfer their knowledge from one team to another because the practices are not shared.

Embedded reliability also does not scale to small teams. If a product team has three engineers, they cannot afford a dedicated reliability person. Either they go without reliability expertise, or they share a reliability engineer across multiple small teams, which dilutes focus and reduces effectiveness.

## The Centralized Model

In the centralized model, reliability engineers form a separate team that supports all product teams. The reliability team is its own organization, with its own leadership, its own roadmap, and its own priorities. Product teams request help from the reliability team — "we need monitoring for our new RAG pipeline," "we need a runbook for our fine-tuned model," "we need help debugging a performance issue." The reliability team provides expertise, builds shared tools, and responds to incidents across the company.

The advantage is leverage and consistency. The centralized reliability team builds monitoring infrastructure once, and every product team uses it. They build a standard incident response process, and every team follows it. They build shared dashboards, shared alerting rules, and shared runbooks. When a new product team forms, they inherit a mature set of reliability practices instead of building everything from scratch. The company's reliability posture improves faster because the expertise is concentrated and reusable.

The centralized team also develops deep expertise in reliability as a discipline. They see patterns across every product, learn from incidents in one team and apply the lessons to others, and build tools that reflect the needs of the entire organization. They can invest in sophisticated reliability engineering — chaos testing, automated anomaly detection, advanced observability — that no single embedded engineer could build alone.

The disadvantage is distance from the product. The centralized reliability team does not sit in product planning meetings. They do not know the roadmap, do not understand the user journeys, and do not see the product evolve day to day. When they build monitoring, they build it generically because they do not have deep context about what matters most for each product. When an incident happens, they take longer to diagnose because they have to ramp up on the system architecture.

Centralized teams also create bottlenecks. Every product team needs reliability support, but the centralized team has finite capacity. Work gets prioritized, which means some teams wait weeks for help while the reliability team focuses on higher-priority products. The teams that wait either delay their launch, ship without adequate reliability, or build their own ad-hoc solutions that later become technical debt.

## Hybrid Approaches

Most organizations that operate at scale end up with a hybrid model — some combination of embedded and centralized reliability. The largest, most critical product teams get embedded reliability engineers. Smaller teams are supported by a centralized reliability team that provides shared infrastructure, standards, and incident response support.

The embedded reliability engineers maintain deep product context and handle day-to-day reliability for their teams. The centralized reliability team builds the shared infrastructure that all teams use — monitoring platforms, alerting systems, incident management tools, chaos testing frameworks. They also set company-wide reliability standards, run incident post-mortems across teams, and provide consulting to teams that do not have embedded reliability engineers.

In some hybrid models, embedded reliability engineers have a **dotted-line reporting relationship** to a centralized reliability organization. They report directly to the product team's engineering manager, but they also report to the head of reliability for guidance, career development, and alignment on standards. This keeps them embedded in the product team while ensuring they stay connected to the broader reliability community.

In other hybrid models, reliability engineers rotate between being embedded and being centralized. An engineer spends six months embedded with a product team, builds deep context, improves that product's reliability, then rotates to a different team or back to the central team. This prevents the embedded engineer from becoming siloed while allowing them to build the deep context that makes them effective.

## Tradeoffs of Each Model

The embedded model works best when you have large, autonomous product teams with sufficient headcount to justify a dedicated reliability engineer. It works when your products are relatively independent — each team's system can be understood and improved without deep knowledge of every other team's system. It works when you value product-specific reliability excellence over company-wide consistency.

The centralized model works best when you have many small product teams, when your products are tightly interconnected and require coordinated reliability efforts, or when you are early in your reliability maturity and need to build foundational infrastructure before you can support embedded engineers. It works when consistency and leverage matter more than deep product context.

The hybrid model works best when you have a mix of team sizes, when some products are business-critical and others are lower-risk, or when you have reached enough scale that you can afford both embedded and centralized reliability. It works when you want the advantages of both models and can manage the coordination cost.

The tradeoff is not purely technical. It is cultural. Embedded reliability engineers think of themselves as part of the product team. Centralized reliability engineers think of themselves as part of the reliability organization. Hybrid models require engineers who can navigate both identities and organizations that can support dual reporting structures without creating conflict.

## Transitioning Between Models

Many organizations start with no reliability team, realize they have a problem, and hire their first reliability engineer. That engineer is usually centralized by default — they cannot be embedded in every team, so they support everyone. As the company grows, the centralized model starts to break down. The reliability engineer becomes a bottleneck, teams start building their own solutions, and reliability becomes inconsistent.

At that point, the company transitions to embedded or hybrid. They hire more reliability engineers and place them in the largest, most critical teams. Those teams immediately improve. The teams that do not get embedded engineers feel neglected. The centralized team shrinks or disappears because everyone wants embedded support.

Later, the company realizes they need centralization again. Embedded teams have built incompatible monitoring systems, incident response is inconsistent, and there are no shared standards. They rebuild a centralized reliability team focused on infrastructure and standards, but they keep the embedded engineers in place. This is the hybrid model, and it usually emerges organically as companies grow rather than being designed upfront.

If you are transitioning, manage the change deliberately. Explain to teams why you are moving from one model to another. If you are centralizing reliability that was previously embedded, make sure teams understand what support they will still receive and what they will need to own themselves. If you are embedding reliability engineers into teams that previously relied on a central team, make sure the embedded engineers are empowered to make decisions and are not just bottlenecks in a different location.

## Scaling Reliability as the Organization Grows

At ten engineers, you do not need a dedicated reliability role. Someone on the engineering team handles it part-time. At fifty engineers, you hire your first reliability engineer. They are centralized and support everyone. At two hundred engineers, you have a centralized reliability team of three to five people building shared infrastructure. At five hundred engineers, you start embedding reliability engineers into the largest product teams while maintaining a central team for shared services. At a thousand engineers, you have a mix of embedded and centralized reliability with formal standards, career paths, and shared practices across both.

This progression is not a rule — it is a pattern. Your company might follow it, or you might jump directly to hybrid, or you might stay centralized longer than others. The key is to recognize when the current model is no longer working and to evolve before reliability becomes a crisis.

## Reporting Structures

Embedded reliability engineers usually report to the product team's engineering manager. This aligns their incentives with the product team's success and ensures they are integrated into the team's decision-making. The risk is that product pressure overrides reliability priorities — the team skips reliability work to ship features faster, and the embedded engineer cannot push back effectively.

Centralized reliability engineers usually report to a director or VP of infrastructure, platform, or reliability. This gives them the organizational authority to set standards, build shared infrastructure, and push back on product teams when necessary. The risk is that they become disconnected from product priorities and build infrastructure that does not serve real needs.

In hybrid models, embedded engineers sometimes have dual reporting — they report to the product team's engineering manager for day-to-day work and to the head of reliability for career development, standards, and long-term priorities. This is organizationally complex but can work if both managers collaborate well.

The reporting structure matters because it determines where reliability sits in the organization's priorities. If reliability engineers report to product, reliability becomes a product concern. If they report to infrastructure, reliability becomes an infrastructure concern. Neither is inherently better, but the choice should be deliberate.

## Career Paths for Reliability Engineers

Reliability engineers need career paths that reward deep expertise, leadership, and impact. In embedded models, reliability engineers can grow into senior or staff roles within their product team, or they can transition into engineering management for that product. They can also move between product teams to broaden their experience.

In centralized models, reliability engineers grow by building increasingly sophisticated infrastructure, leading reliability initiatives across the company, or moving into leadership roles within the reliability organization. They can specialize in specific domains — AI reliability, distributed systems reliability, observability, chaos engineering — and become recognized experts.

In hybrid models, engineers can move between embedded and centralized roles as part of their career development. They start centralized, learn the infrastructure, then embed with a product team to build product expertise. Later, they return to the central team in a senior role, bringing product perspective to infrastructure decisions.

The worst outcome is having no defined career path. Reliability engineers join, do good work, hit a ceiling because there is no senior reliability role to grow into, and leave. Companies that invest in reliability engineering but not in reliability careers lose their best people and have to rebuild expertise from scratch.
