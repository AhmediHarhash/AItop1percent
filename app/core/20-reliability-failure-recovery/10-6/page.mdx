# 10.6 — SLA Design for AI Products: What to Promise Customers

In July 2025, a B2B AI contract analysis platform signed an enterprise customer with an aggressive SLA: 98 percent accuracy on contract clause extraction, measured monthly, with a 25 percent service credit for any breach. The sales team celebrated. Engineering was horrified.

Three months later, the platform's accuracy dropped to 96.8 percent due to a shift in contract formats the model had not seen during training. The customer invoked the SLA. The company paid $78,000 in service credits — more than the entire contract value for that quarter. Worse, the customer's trust was shattered. They did not renew.

The problem was not the technology. The problem was the SLA. The sales team promised something engineering could not consistently deliver. The contract made a commitment the system could not guarantee. The result was financial loss, customer churn, and a year of renegotiating every enterprise SLA to something achievable.

## SLA Versus SLO Distinction

An SLA is a contractual commitment with financial consequences. You promise a customer a specific level of service. If you fail to deliver, you pay penalties. SLAs are legally binding. Customers enforce them.

An SLO is an internal target. You set it for operational discipline and to guide engineering priorities. SLOs are not contractual. Customers do not enforce them. You can miss an SLO without legal or financial penalty.

The relationship between SLAs and SLOs is critical. Your SLA should always be looser than your SLO. If your internal SLO is 99 percent uptime, your customer-facing SLA should be 98 percent or 97 percent. The gap is your safety margin. It protects you from the inevitable variance in AI system performance.

Why the gap matters: AI systems are probabilistic. Models degrade. Providers fail. Input distributions shift. You cannot guarantee 99 percent reliability every single month. Some months you hit 98.5 percent. Some months you hit 99.5 percent. If your SLA is set at 99 percent and you hit 98.5 percent, you breach and pay penalties. If your SLA is set at 97 percent and you hit 98.5 percent, you exceed expectations and build trust.

A customer support AI company set internal SLOs at 95 percent accuracy and 1.5 second latency. Their customer-facing SLAs promised 90 percent accuracy and 2 second latency. The five-point accuracy gap and half-second latency gap gave them margin for monthly variance, provider outages, and model updates. Over 18 months, they never breached an SLA. Customers perceived them as highly reliable, even though internal metrics occasionally dipped below SLO targets.

## What to Include in AI SLAs

SLAs must be specific, measurable, and achievable. Vague commitments create disputes. Unmeasurable commitments are unenforceable. Unachievable commitments guarantee breach.

Include availability commitments if your product is API-based or real-time. Promise uptime as a percentage: "The service will be available 99.5 percent of the time each month." Define availability clearly: "Availability is measured by successful API responses with HTTP 200 status codes."

Include latency commitments if speed matters to the use case. Promise response time at a percentile: "95 percent of requests will complete within 2 seconds." Use percentiles, not averages. Averages hide outliers. A 500ms average could mean most requests are fast and a few are catastrophically slow.

Include quality commitments cautiously. Quality is subjective and hard to measure in real time. If you make a quality commitment, define it precisely: "90 percent of classification predictions will have confidence scores above 85 percent" or "summarization outputs will match ground truth by ROUGE score above 0.75 in 85 percent of cases."

Do not commit to outcomes you cannot directly measure. "The model will never hallucinate" is unmeasurable. "The model will refuse to answer when confidence is below 70 percent" is measurable. "The model will always provide accurate legal advice" is unachievable and creates liability. "The model will flag low-confidence legal interpretations for human review" is achievable.

Include measurement methodology in the SLA. How will you measure compliance? Who collects the data? What tools are used? Can the customer audit the measurement? Disputes arise when measurement methodology is ambiguous. Specify it upfront.

## What NOT to Include in AI SLAs

Never commit to eliminating failure modes you cannot control. Do not promise "zero hallucinations" or "perfect accuracy" or "no biased outputs." These commitments are impossible. AI systems fail probabilistically. Promise bounded failure rates, not zero failure rates.

Never commit to specific model architectures or providers. Do not say "powered by GPT-5.1" or "uses Claude Opus 4.5" in an SLA. You need flexibility to change models, switch providers, or update architectures without renegotiating contracts. Commit to outcomes — accuracy, latency, availability — not implementation details.

Never commit to performance on customer data you have not seen. A common trap: "The model will achieve 95 percent accuracy on your contracts." You have no idea what the customer's contracts look like. Their data distribution might be completely different from your training set. Commit to performance on benchmark data or offer a trial period to validate performance before signing the SLA.

Never tie service credits to subjective quality judgments. "If the customer is unsatisfied with output quality, they receive a 10 percent refund" is a recipe for disputes. Quality dissatisfaction is subjective. One customer's acceptable output is another customer's unacceptable garbage. Tie credits to objective, measurable metrics only.

Never include uncapped service credits. Some SLAs say "for every percentage point below 95 percent accuracy, the customer receives a 5 percent refund." If your accuracy drops to 80 percent, you owe 75 percent of the contract value in credits. If it drops to 70 percent, you owe 125 percent — more than the customer paid. Cap service credits at 100 percent of monthly fees or a fixed dollar amount. Uncapped credits create existential financial risk.

A legal AI startup signed an SLA promising "95 percent accuracy on case law citations" without defining how accuracy would be measured. The customer measured accuracy manually by sampling 100 citations per month. The startup measured accuracy automatically using a citation validator. The two methods produced different results. The customer claimed 89 percent accuracy. The startup claimed 96 percent. The dispute escalated to arbitration. The contract was terminated. The startup spent $120,000 in legal fees. The lesson: measurement methodology must be explicit and agreed upon before signing.

## Service Credits and Penalties

Service credits are the enforcement mechanism for SLAs. When you breach an SLA, the customer receives a credit — typically a percentage of their monthly fees.

Structure credits in tiers. A minor breach triggers a small credit. A major breach triggers a large credit. For example: miss your 99 percent availability target by one percentage point, customer gets 5 percent credit. Miss by two percentage points, customer gets 10 percent credit. Miss by three or more, customer gets 25 percent credit.

Tiered credits align penalties with impact. A small reliability dip costs you a little. A catastrophic failure costs you a lot. The structure creates the right incentives.

Cap total credits per period. If your tiered credits can theoretically exceed 100 percent of monthly fees, cap the total at 100 percent. No customer should receive more in credits than they paid. The cap protects you from financial ruin while still providing meaningful customer compensation.

Make credit claims process explicit. How does the customer request a credit? Do they need to file a claim or is it automatic? What evidence do they need to provide? What is the timeline for issuing credits? Ambiguity creates friction and distrust.

Some SLAs include termination rights instead of or in addition to service credits. If you breach SLAs for three consecutive months, the customer can terminate the contract without penalty. This is high stakes. Repeated breaches cost you the customer entirely, not just monthly credits.

A SaaS AI analytics company used a tiered credit structure: 5 percent credit for 97-98 percent availability, 10 percent for 95-97 percent, 25 percent below 95 percent. Credits were automatic — calculated by the system and applied to the next invoice without customer action required. Over two years, they issued credits in four months totaling $42,000 across 80 customers. The automatic credit process prevented disputes and maintained trust even during breaches.

## The Provider Dependency Problem

Your AI system depends on third-party providers — model APIs, infrastructure platforms, data services. When those providers fail, your system fails. When your system fails, you breach your SLA. You pay penalties for failures you did not cause and cannot prevent.

This is the provider dependency problem. Your SLA commits to outcomes you do not fully control. The solution is SLA carve-outs for provider failures.

Include force majeure clauses. Standard legal language excuses non-performance due to circumstances beyond your control — natural disasters, war, government action. Extend force majeure to include third-party provider outages that exceed certain thresholds.

Specify provider-related exclusions explicitly. "Service credits do not apply during periods when the underlying model provider is experiencing documented outages affecting more than 10 percent of their customer base." The exclusion must be specific. "We are not responsible for provider issues" is too vague and unenforceable.

Track provider SLAs and ensure they are better than your customer SLAs. If you promise customers 99.5 percent availability, your provider SLAs should promise you 99.9 percent. The gap protects you. If your provider delivers 99.9 percent and you deliver 99.5 percent, you have margin for your own errors. If your provider only delivers 99 percent and you promise 99.5 percent, you will breach through no fault of your own.

Consider multi-provider strategies for critical dependencies. If model provider A has an outage, fail over to provider B. The redundancy costs more but protects you from SLA breaches due to single-provider failures.

A document processing AI company depended on a cloud vision API for document scanning. The vision API went down for six hours in March 2025, taking the entire document processing system offline. The company breached their 99.5 percent uptime SLA and owed $18,000 in credits. They revised their SLA to exclude outages when the vision API was unavailable, and they implemented a backup provider. The next time the primary vision API failed, they failed over to the backup. Customers experienced degraded quality but not total outage. No SLA breach occurred.

## SLA Carve-Outs and Exclusions

Carve-outs protect you from SLA breaches caused by factors outside your control. They are essential for AI systems with high dependency on external data, models, or infrastructure.

Exclude planned maintenance windows. "The SLA does not apply during scheduled maintenance windows announced at least 72 hours in advance." Maintenance windows allow you to deploy updates, retrain models, and perform infrastructure upgrades without SLA liability.

Exclude beta features. If you offer experimental features alongside production features, make clear that beta features are not covered by SLAs. Customers trying new capabilities accept higher risk in exchange for early access.

Exclude customer-caused failures. If a customer sends malformed requests, exceeds rate limits, or provides bad input data, resulting failures do not count against your SLA. Define customer responsibilities clearly.

Exclude abuse and attacks. If your system is under a DDoS attack or a coordinated abuse campaign, resulting downtime does not count against SLAs. Security incidents are force majeure events.

Exclude data-dependent failures. If your model's performance depends on the quality of customer-provided data, make clear that accuracy SLAs only apply when customer data meets minimum quality standards. If the customer uploads garbage, the model's garbage output is not your SLA breach.

Carve-outs must be specific. "The provider reserves the right to exclude certain failures from SLA calculations" is too broad and will not hold up in disputes. "SLA measurements exclude requests that return HTTP 429 rate limit errors due to customer exceeding agreed-upon usage limits" is specific and enforceable.

A healthcare AI company had a carve-out for "clinician-initiated overrides." When a doctor manually overrode the AI's recommendation, the outcome was excluded from quality SLAs. The carve-out recognized that human clinical judgment might contradict the AI for valid reasons, and those contradictions should not count as AI failures. The carve-out was tested when a doctor overrode a recommendation that later proved correct. The company did not count the override as a quality failure under their SLA. The doctor appreciated the flexibility.

## Negotiating AI SLAs with Customers

Enterprise customers want aggressive SLAs. They want high reliability guarantees and large service credits. You want achievable SLAs with reasonable penalties. Negotiation is inevitable.

Start with data. Show the customer your historical reliability metrics. If you have delivered 97 percent uptime over the past 12 months, you can credibly commit to 95 percent in an SLA. You cannot credibly commit to 99 percent. Data grounds the negotiation in reality.

Offer tiered SLAs. Some customers need high reliability and will pay for it. Others accept lower reliability at lower cost. Offer 95 percent uptime at standard pricing and 98 percent uptime at a 30 percent premium. Let the customer choose the reliability level they need.

Tie SLA commitments to usage limits. "This SLA applies to up to 1 million requests per month. Usage beyond 1 million requests is not covered." The cap protects you from SLA breaches caused by unexpected traffic spikes.

Negotiate measurement windows. Monthly measurement gives you more tolerance for variance than daily or weekly measurement. If a single bad day causes a weekly SLA breach but would not cause a monthly breach, argue for monthly measurement.

Negotiate credit caps. If the customer demands high service credits, cap them at 50 percent or 100 percent of monthly fees. Explain that uncapped credits create financial risk that forces you to price the contract higher to absorb that risk.

Be willing to walk away. If a customer demands an SLA you cannot reliably meet, do not sign the contract. A breach costs you money, trust, and the customer relationship. Better to lose the deal upfront than sign a contract you will inevitably breach.

A customer service AI company negotiated an SLA with a large retail customer who demanded 99 percent uptime and 50 percent service credits for any breach. The company's historical uptime was 97.5 percent. They countered with 97 percent uptime and 25 percent service credits, or 98 percent uptime at a 40 percent price increase to fund infrastructure upgrades. The customer chose 97 percent at standard pricing. The company met the SLA for 11 out of 12 months, paid one month of credits, and retained the customer.

## SLA Monitoring and Reporting

SLAs are only meaningful if compliance is measured and reported. Customers need visibility into whether you are meeting commitments.

Automate SLA measurement. Your monitoring systems should continuously track availability, latency, and quality metrics. Aggregate data daily and monthly. Calculate SLA compliance automatically. Manual measurement is error-prone and disputed.

Provide customer-facing SLA dashboards. Let customers see real-time compliance. Show uptime percentage, current latency, recent incident history. Transparency builds trust. Customers who can see you consistently meet SLAs trust you more than customers who only hear about performance during quarterly business reviews.

Generate monthly SLA reports. Send every customer a report showing SLA compliance for the past month. Include uptime percentage, latency percentiles, incident summaries, and service credit calculations if applicable. Proactive reporting prevents disputes.

Disclose breaches immediately. If you breach an SLA, inform the customer within 24 hours. Explain what happened, what you are doing to fix it, and what credits they will receive. Customers appreciate transparency. They hate discovering breaches through their own monitoring while you stay silent.

Track SLA compliance trends over time. Are you consistently meeting SLAs or frequently breaching? Are breaches clustered in certain months or evenly distributed? Trends inform whether your SLAs are correctly calibrated or need adjustment.

A fintech AI company built a customer SLA portal showing real-time uptime, current latency, and monthly compliance trends. Customers could log in anytime and see performance data. The portal included a credit calculator: "If uptime drops below 98 percent this month, you will receive a 10 percent credit." The transparency reduced support inquiries by 30 percent and built trust. Customers saw that the company took SLAs seriously and measured them rigorously.

Your SLA is a promise with teeth. It defines what you commit to, how you measure it, what happens when you fail, and what you do not guarantee. Get it right and it aligns expectations, builds trust, and protects both you and your customers. Get it wrong and it costs you money, reputation, and customer relationships you cannot afford to lose.
