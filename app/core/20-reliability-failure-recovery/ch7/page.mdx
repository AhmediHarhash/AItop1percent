# Chapter 7 — Recovery Procedures and State Management

When the incident commander declares the incident resolved, the technical work is often just beginning. Resolution means the immediate crisis is over — the outage stopped, the runaway agent halted, the failing deployment rolled back. Recovery means the system is genuinely restored to safe, reliable operation with all its state, context, and user trust intact. For AI systems, especially agent systems that maintain memory and take actions in external systems, recovery is a discipline unto itself.

The distinction matters because AI systems fail in ways traditional software does not. A crashed web server restarts cleanly with no memory of its previous state. An agent system that fails mid-conversation may have corrupted memory, half-completed actions, and users expecting continuity when they return. A stateless API recovers instantly when traffic returns. A conversational AI must reconstruct context, validate state, and convince users it remembers who they are. This chapter covers the procedures, checklists, and state management techniques that ensure recovery is complete — not just declared.

Recovery is where reliability engineering meets operational maturity. The teams that recover well have checklists, validation procedures, and clear definitions of what "recovered" means. The teams that recover poorly declare victory when the dashboard turns green, then spend the next three days firefighting secondary failures, confused users, and corrupted agent state.
