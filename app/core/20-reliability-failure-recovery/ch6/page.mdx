# Chapter 6 — Incident Response for AI Systems

When an AI system fails in production, you face a problem that traditional incident response was never designed to handle. The system is still responding. Latency is normal. Error rates are zero. But the outputs are subtly wrong in ways that took three hours to notice and that you still cannot fully quantify. Traditional incident response assumes you can detect failure, diagnose cause, and validate recovery. AI incidents break all three assumptions. Detection is delayed because quality degrades silently. Diagnosis is probabilistic because root cause lives in model behavior, not code paths. Recovery validation requires running evals that take twenty minutes while users are still experiencing the problem. The incident commander who treats an AI incident like a database outage will make every decision wrong.

AI incident response is not traditional incident response with model monitoring added. It is a fundamentally different discipline that requires different severity classifications, different runbooks, different communication patterns, and different success criteria. The responder must act decisively under uncertainty, knowing that waiting for perfect information means the damage compounds, but acting on imperfect information means potentially rolling back a healthy system. This chapter teaches you how to build incident response capabilities that work when failure is ambiguous, diagnosis is uncertain, and recovery cannot be validated in real time.

*The difference between an incident that costs you users and an incident that costs you the business is response speed under uncertainty.*
