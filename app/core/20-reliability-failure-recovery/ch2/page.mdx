# Chapter 2 — Incident Detection and Alerting

Traditional infrastructure monitoring tells you when servers crash. AI reliability monitoring tells you when intelligence degrades. The difference is fundamental. Infrastructure failures are loud, binary, and self-reporting. A crashed service announces itself through error codes, failed health checks, and connection timeouts. AI failures are silent, gradual, and invisible to traditional observability. A model producing garbage responses still returns HTTP 200. The API is up. The intelligence is down. By the time anyone notices, thousands of users have interacted with a broken system.

This is the detection problem for AI systems. You cannot respond to failures you do not know about. Traditional monitoring is necessary but insufficient. You need a quality signal stack that measures what matters: correctness, relevance, safety, consistency, and business impact. You need real-time detectors that sample production outputs continuously. You need alert design that balances sensitivity and specificity without creating alert fatigue. And you need to distinguish AI-specific failures from normal traffic fluctuations.

This chapter builds the Detect layer of the AI Reliability Stack. The techniques here determine whether you catch regressions before users experience them or learn about degradation through support tickets and social media complaints. Every subsequent layer — containment, fallback, recovery — depends on fast, accurate detection. Get this wrong and nothing else matters.
