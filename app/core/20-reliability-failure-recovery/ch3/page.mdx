# Chapter 3 — Circuit Breakers and Defensive Patterns

Detection without containment is observation without action. You can watch your model degrade in real-time, receive alerts within seconds, and understand exactly what is failing. But if requests continue flowing to the broken component while you scramble to fix it, every second compounds the damage. Users receive bad outputs. Downstream systems amplify errors. Costs accumulate. Trust erodes. The incident grows from contained to catastrophic not because you failed to detect it, but because you failed to stop it.

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by failing fast when a component is unhealthy. The pattern comes from electrical systems: when current exceeds safe thresholds, the circuit breaker trips, cutting power to prevent damage. In distributed systems, when a service becomes unhealthy, the circuit breaker stops sending it traffic, preventing request pile-ups and allowing degraded components to recover. In AI systems, circuit breakers stop traffic to failing models, unhealthy providers, degraded RAG pipelines, and runaway agents before they can damage production at scale.

This is the Contain layer of the AI Reliability Stack. Circuit breakers are not optional defensive patterns for mature systems. They are baseline production hygiene for any AI system handling real traffic. A model provider goes down. Your circuit breaker detects the failure within seconds and routes traffic to a backup provider. Your users experience a seamless failover instead of a two-hour outage. This is not theoretical resilience engineering. This is Monday morning operational reality.

This chapter builds the defensive architecture that limits blast radius when failures occur. The techniques here determine whether a single component failure becomes a system-wide incident or gets isolated and handled gracefully. Every AI system fails. The systems that survive are the ones that fail safely.
