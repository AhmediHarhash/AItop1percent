# Chapter 12 — Drift, Decay, and System Aging

AI systems do not just fail suddenly — they age, decay, and drift silently over time. Traditional software breaks loudly when dependencies disappear or APIs change. AI systems degrade quietly as the world shifts beneath them, as embeddings drift from their original meaning, as training data becomes contaminated with bad outputs. By the time you notice the problem, users have already experienced months of declining quality. This chapter teaches how to detect system aging before it becomes visible to users, and how to build maintenance processes that keep AI systems aligned with reality over years of production operation.

*The most dangerous failures are the ones that happen slowly enough that nobody notices until it's too late.*
