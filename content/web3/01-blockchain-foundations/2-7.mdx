# 2.7 — Consensus Failures and Network Attacks
Scope: Web3

## The 51 Percent Attack: The Canonical Failure Mode
If one actor controls enough consensus power, it can bias block order and weaken trust.

This is the baseline risk for any chain model.

## The Cost-to-Attack Ratio: The Framework That Actually Matters
Evaluate cost versus gain.

If the expected gain from attack remains below sustained honest cost, safety holds. If not, the chain is weak by design.

## Eclipse Attacks: Isolating Nodes From Reality
An attacker can isolate a set of nodes from broader gossip so they follow a manipulated view.

This breaks assumptions before application logic even sees a fault.

## Selfish Mining: Gaming the Protocol's Own Rules
A participant may withhold blocks to gain a larger eventual reward.

That creates local unfairness and can delay finality.

## Long-Range Attacks: Rewriting History in Proof of Stake
Old signing keys and stale history can be used to propose alternative chains if checkpoints and assumptions are weak.

This is where weak subjectivity and checkpointing become operational safeguards.

## Validator Collusion: The Cartel Problem
If several validators coordinate, they can bias inclusion and ordering.

Your censorship risk grows when influence is concentrated, even without total control.

## Liveness Attacks: Stopping the Chain
Attacks that target availability do not always reverse state. They slow production and trust.

For user-facing services, liveness drops can look like wallet failure.

## Network-Level Attacks: BGP Hijacking and Time Manipulation
Routing-level attacks can isolate network segments and distort peer information.

Consensus security has an unglamorous dependency on network transport and time consistency.

## How Major Chains Defend Against These Attacks
Defense is layered: peer diversity, relay protections, stricter slash conditions, and fast incident playbooks.

No chain is protected by one mechanism.

## Why Smaller Chains Remain Vulnerable
Low operator count, limited monitoring, and fewer tools increase exploitability.

A smaller ecosystem can still succeed, but only with explicit risk controls.

## From Attacks to Architecture
Your architecture decision should include attack models, not only performance benchmarks.

Next chapter makes that shift explicit for builders.
