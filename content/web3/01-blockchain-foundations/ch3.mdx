# Chapter 3 â€” Trust, Security, and What You Are Actually Betting On

The word "trustless" was blockchain's most successful marketing term and its most misleading. No system operates without trust. Blockchains do not eliminate trust â€” they redistribute it. From banks to code. From institutions to cryptography. From single points of failure to distributed validator sets. Understanding where trust actually lives in your system is the difference between building something robust and building something that looks decentralized but collapses at the first exploit.

This chapter maps the full trust stack: protocol-level trust, cryptographic guarantees, economic incentives, social governance, bridge risk, sequencer centralization, oracle dependencies, and key management. By the end, you will have a practical framework for auditing the trust assumptions in any system you build or use.

*Every system you build has trust assumptions. This chapter teaches you to find them before they find you.*
