# 4.10 â€” Why the Trilemma Has Not Been Solved (and That Is Fine)

No blockchain has solved the trilemma. Every blockchain that claims otherwise has redefined the terms.

This is the most important sentence in this chapter, and possibly in this entire section. It is also the sentence that generates the most arguments on social media, the most heated conference debates, and the most misleading marketing. So let us be precise about what it means and why accepting it is the mark of engineering maturity rather than defeatism.

## What "Solved" Would Actually Mean

To solve the blockchain trilemma, a system would need to simultaneously achieve three things. First, maximum decentralization â€” anyone with consumer hardware can run a full node and participate in consensus, producing a validator set so large and geographically distributed that no entity or coalition can control, censor, or shut down the network. Second, maximum security â€” the cost of attacking the network (reversing transactions, double-spending, censoring users) is so high that no economically rational actor would attempt it, even at nation-state scale. Third, maximum scalability â€” the network processes enough transactions, fast enough and cheap enough, to serve billions of users with the responsiveness of a centralized application.

Solving the trilemma would mean achieving all three at their maxima simultaneously, not achieving two and making a concession on the third, and not achieving all three at reduced levels. The claim is specific: you cannot have all three at maximum without a tradeoff somewhere. The reason is grounded in the physics of distributed systems: the more nodes that must reach agreement, the more communication overhead exists, which limits throughput. You can reduce that overhead by reducing the number of nodes (sacrificing decentralization) or by reducing the verification burden per node (which can sacrifice security or require stronger hardware, again limiting decentralization). These constraints are not bugs waiting to be fixed. They are properties of how consensus works across unreliable networks.

## Ethereum: Security and Decentralization, Scalability via Composition

Ethereum's approach to the trilemma is the clearest example of deliberate tradeoff engineering. Ethereum L1 chose maximum decentralization and security. Over a million validators. Consumer-grade hardware requirements for running a node. A Nakamoto coefficient â€” the minimum number of entities needed to compromise consensus â€” that is among the highest of any blockchain. Economic security backed by more than 34 million staked ETH.

The price of these choices is L1 scalability. Ethereum processes roughly 15 transactions per second on its base layer. Gas costs during periods of high demand can exceed tens of dollars per transaction. For a network that aspires to be the settlement layer for global finance, 15 TPS is laughably insufficient.

Ethereum's answer is not to increase L1 throughput by reducing decentralization. Its answer is modularity: push execution to L2 rollups, expand data availability through blobs and PeerDAS, and keep L1 as a maximally secure and decentralized settlement layer. This is elegant, but it is not a trilemma solution. It is a trilemma workaround. The system as a whole â€” L1 plus L2s plus DA layers â€” achieves high marks in all three dimensions, but only because it is no longer a single system. The L2s inherit Ethereum's security through settlement, but they make their own decentralization tradeoffs (most run centralized sequencers). The DA layer scales data throughput, but it introduces new trust assumptions (PeerDAS sampling, external DA layers). Every gain in one dimension comes from a specific concession somewhere in the stack.

In January 2026, Vitalik Buterin stated that Ethereum had "solved" the trilemma, pointing to PeerDAS for data throughput and emerging ZK-EVMs for verification. The statement is defensible if you define "solved" as "the architecture exists to achieve all three goals together." It is not defensible if you define "solved" as "all three properties are simultaneously maximized in production today." PeerDAS shipped in December 2025 with the Fusaka upgrade, but ZK-EVMs are in alpha. Centralized sequencers remain the norm for major rollups. The architecture is on a path. The destination has not been reached.

## Solana: Performance Over Decentralization

Solana made the opposite bet. Rather than accepting low throughput and adding layers, Solana pushed for maximum performance at the base layer. Its proof-of-history mechanism, combined with parallel transaction execution and aggressive hardware requirements, delivers thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality and fees that average less than a tenth of a cent.

The tradeoff is decentralization, and the data makes it explicit. Running a Solana validator requires enterprise-grade hardware: a minimum of 256 gigabytes of RAM, a high-end multi-core CPU, terabytes of NVMe storage, and at least one-gigabit sustained network bandwidth. Monthly hosting costs start around 400 to 600 dollars for a minimal setup and easily exceed 1,200 dollars for competitive configurations. Compare this to Ethereum, where a validator node runs on a consumer laptop with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a solid-state drive.

The consequence: after the Solana Foundation's validator pruning process in 2025 â€” which removed underperforming and non-contributing nodes â€” the staked validator count settled around 800. The network has roughly 5,100 total nodes including unstaked RPC nodes, distributed across 48 countries, but the consensus-participating set is far smaller than Ethereum's. The Nakamoto coefficient â€” the number of validators needed to halt the network â€” is approximately 20. That is higher than many smaller chains, but it means 20 entities could collectively disrupt Solana's consensus. On Ethereum, that number is orders of magnitude larger.

Solana's developers know this. Mert Mumtaz, a prominent Solana developer, has publicly dismissed the trilemma as "not a real thing" â€” arguing that hardware improvements and protocol innovations make the traditional framing obsolete. The Firedancer client, developed by Jump Crypto, promises to reduce hardware requirements and improve throughput further. These are real engineering advances. They do not eliminate the fundamental tradeoff; they shift the curve. Cheaper hardware means more people can run validators, which improves decentralization. But Solana's design philosophy â€” maximize single-chain performance â€” will always require more from validators than Ethereum's design philosophy â€” minimize single-node requirements. The tradeoff is embedded in the architecture, not in the current state of hardware.

## The Claims That Do Not Hold Up

Every cycle produces chains that claim to have solved the trilemma. The claims follow a pattern: redefine one of the three dimensions to mean something less demanding, then declare victory in the newly relaxed framework.

Avalanche launched with the claim that its novel consensus mechanism â€” a probabilistic protocol based on repeated random sampling â€” achieved high throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security. The throughput was real: thousands of TPS on the C-Chain. But the C-Chain's validator set, while larger than Solana's, is substantially smaller than Ethereum's. And Avalanche's approach to scaling â€” subnets, which are essentially appchains with their own validator sets â€” is a modular solution that faces the same trust-assumption composition challenges as Ethereum's rollup ecosystem. Avalanche did not solve the trilemma. It chose a different point on the tradeoff curve.

Near Protocol introduced sharding â€” splitting the network into parallel processing groups called shards â€” to scale throughput while maintaining a large validator set. The engineering is sophisticated, but sharding introduces cross-shard communication latency, potential security concerns (an attacker can concentrate resources on a single shard rather than the whole network), and significant implementation complexity. Near made real progress on scaling, but the progress came with tradeoffs that the "trilemma solved" marketing omits.

Aptos and Sui, both emerging from Meta's abandoned Diem project, use Move-based execution engines that enable parallel transaction processing. They achieve high throughput â€” Aptos claims over 100,000 TPS in benchmarks â€” but these numbers come from controlled environments, not production load with real-world transaction diversity. In production, the validator sets are relatively small, the hardware requirements are substantial, and the networks are young enough that their security has not been tested by sophisticated attacks. High benchmarks are not the same as proven trilemma resolution.

The pattern is consistent: strong engineering, real improvements, honest tradeoffs repackaged as trilemma solutions. The marketing serves fundraising. The engineering serves users. They are not the same thing.

## Why Accepting Tradeoffs Is the Mature Position

The teams that build the most successful blockchain applications are not the ones searching for the chain that solved the trilemma. They are the ones who understood which tradeoffs mattered for their specific use case and chose accordingly.

Uniswap is the most successful decentralized exchange in history. It started on Ethereum L1, accepted the gas costs, and served high-value traders who could absorb multi-dollar fees. When L2s matured, Uniswap deployed on Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and others â€” the same protocol, different tradeoff profiles for different user segments. Uniswap did not wait for the trilemma to be solved. It worked within the constraints of each layer.

Circle, the issuer of USDC, deploys across Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Base, Arbitrum, and multiple other chains. Each deployment reflects a different tradeoff profile. USDC on Ethereum L1 serves institutional settlement. USDC on Solana serves high-speed payment flows. USDC on Base serves Coinbase-integrated consumer applications. Circle does not have a "favorite chain." It has a portfolio of tradeoff profiles matched to user segments.

Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol, manages over 27 billion dollars in staked ETH. It chose Ethereum because its security requirement is absolute â€” a compromise of Lido's contracts would be one of the largest financial losses in history. Lido does not need cheap transactions. It needs indestructible settlement. The tradeoff â€” high gas costs for deposits and withdrawals â€” is acceptable because the value secured justifies the cost.

Each of these teams made different choices. None of them chose wrong. All of them chose deliberately. That is the lesson.

## The Security Budget Problem

There is a deeper reason the trilemma resists solution, and it goes beyond consensus mechanics. It is economic. Every proof-of-stake blockchain's security depends on its **security budget** â€” the total economic value staked by validators, which represents the cost an attacker must bear to compromise the network.

Ethereum's security budget is roughly 100 billion dollars in staked ETH. Solana's is roughly 80 billion in staked SOL. Smaller chains â€” the ones claiming to solve the trilemma with novel consensus â€” typically have security budgets measured in single-digit billions or less. A chain with two billion dollars in staked tokens can be attacked by an entity willing to acquire one-third of that stake: roughly 700 million dollars. For a nation-state, a well-funded criminal organization, or a determined short seller, that number is not unthinkable.

The security budget creates a gravitational pull. High-value applications migrate to chains with higher security budgets, which increases demand for the native token, which increases the security budget further. This is why DeFi TVL concentrates on Ethereum â€” approximately 68 percent of all DeFi value locked, roughly 100 billion dollars according to DefiLlama data in early 2026. Protocols holding hundreds of millions of dollars need a settlement layer where the cost of attack exceeds the value at risk by orders of magnitude. Only Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Bitcoin provide that guarantee today.

New chains cannot bootstrap a security budget by declaration. They earn it through adoption, through token value appreciation, and through proving over years that their consensus mechanism holds under pressure. A chain that launched last year with a five-billion-dollar security budget has not been tested by the attacks that a 100-billion-dollar security budget naturally deters. Time is a security property. There are no shortcuts.

## The Honest Summary

The blockchain trilemma is not a problem to solve. It is a constraint to engineer within. Like the CAP theorem in distributed systems â€” you cannot have consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously â€” the trilemma describes a fundamental property of decentralized consensus, not a temporary limitation of current technology.

Hardware will get cheaper. Algorithms will get better. Proof systems will become more efficient. These improvements shift the tradeoff curve â€” allowing more throughput for a given level of decentralization, or more decentralization for a given hardware cost. But they do not eliminate the curve. They move along it.

The practical implication: stop evaluating chains by asking "did they solve the trilemma?" Start evaluating them by asking "what tradeoffs did they choose, and do those tradeoffs match my application's requirements?" The first question has no useful answer. The second question leads directly to a good architectural decision.

The teams that build successfully in 2026 and beyond are not the ones waiting for a breakthrough that eliminates tradeoffs. They are the ones who understand the tradeoffs, chose them deliberately using the Tradeoff Profile framework, and built systems that work within their chosen constraints. The trilemma is not their enemy. It is their design parameter.

The next chapter moves from theory to evidence. What is actually working in the blockchain industry in 2026? What has failed? What remains uncertain? The answers separate builders who operate on data from those who operate on narratives.
