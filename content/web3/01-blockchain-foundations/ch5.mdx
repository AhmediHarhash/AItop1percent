# Chapter 5 â€” What Is Real and What Is Hype in 2026

The blockchain industry has a credibility problem. For every genuine breakthrough â€” stablecoins processing billions in real payments, institutions deploying capital on public chains â€” there are a dozen narratives that evaporated the moment the hype cycle turned. Play-to-earn gaming, utility tokens, supply chain blockchains â€” the graveyard is full of ideas that sounded revolutionary in pitch decks and collapsed on contact with reality.

This chapter gives you the honest assessment. Real numbers, named sources, specific data. What is working, what failed, what remains uncertain. By the end, you will never again confuse a bull-market narrative with actual traction.
