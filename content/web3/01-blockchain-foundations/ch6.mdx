# Chapter 6 â€” The Web3 Stack: Your Map for the Rest of This Book

Blockchain is not one technology. It is a stack of specialized layers, each solving a different problem, each with its own tradeoffs and failure modes. Settlement determines where truth lives. Execution determines where computation happens. Data availability determines what it costs. Sequencing determines who orders transactions. Applications determine where users interact. Understanding how these layers fit together â€” and where they break â€” is what separates architects from assemblers.

This chapter maps the complete stack and shows you exactly where every subsequent section of this book fits within it.
