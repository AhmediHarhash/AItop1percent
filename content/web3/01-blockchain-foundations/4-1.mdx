# 4.1 â€” The Trilemma Is Real

Most people who talk about the blockchain trilemma treat it like a debate. They argue over whether it has been solved, whether a particular chain has cracked it, whether it was ever a real constraint in the first place. They are having the wrong conversation. The trilemma is not a thesis you can agree or disagree with. It is an engineering constraint â€” as fundamental to distributed systems as the CAP theorem, as inescapable as thermodynamics. You do not get to opt out.

The blockchain trilemma, first named by Vitalik Buterin, states that a blockchain system can optimize for at most two of three properties simultaneously: security, decentralization, and scalability. You can build a system that is highly secure and highly decentralized, but it will be slow and expensive. You can build a system that is highly secure and highly scalable, but it will centralize around a small number of powerful operators. You can build a system that is highly decentralized and highly scalable, but its security guarantees will be weaker. Pick two. The third one suffers. Every time.

This is not a temporary limitation waiting for someone clever enough to engineer around it. It is an emergent property of distributed consensus itself â€” a consequence of the physics of networks, the economics of participation, and the mathematics of agreement.

## Why The Constraint Exists

To understand why the trilemma is real, you need to understand what each property demands from a network at the infrastructure level.

Security demands that attacking the system is prohibitively expensive. On Bitcoin, that means controlling more than half the global mining hashrate â€” a feat that would cost roughly six billion dollars in hardware alone as of early 2026, according to Braiins research. On Ethereum, it means acquiring and staking enough ETH to control one-third of the validator set â€” which at current staking levels would require corrupting over 100 billion dollars worth of collateral. Security is not a feature you toggle on. It is an economic wall you build around the network, and maintaining that wall is expensive.

Decentralization demands that no small group can control the network. That means thousands of independent nodes, distributed across geographies and jurisdictions, each capable of independently validating every transaction. But here is the tension: the more data each node must process, store, and relay, the more expensive it becomes to run a node. Raise the hardware requirements, and fewer people can participate. Fewer participants means more centralization. The very act of increasing throughput pushes against decentralization.

Scalability demands high transaction throughput, fast finality, and low costs. But in a decentralized network, every full node must process every transaction. If the network handles 15 transactions per second, every node processes 15 transactions per second. If the network handles 15,000, every node must process 15,000 â€” and that requires hardware that most individuals cannot afford. The alternative is to let only some nodes process some transactions, which introduces trust assumptions and reduces decentralization.

These three demands pull against each other not because of bad engineering, but because of how information propagates through networks. A message sent to ten nodes reaches consensus faster than a message sent to ten thousand. A node that must store the complete history of every transaction needs more hardware than one that stores only recent summaries. A network that requires every participant to validate everything moves slower than one that lets a small committee validate on behalf of everyone else. These are not bugs. They are physics.

## The Three Archetypes

Every blockchain in production today occupies a position within the trilemma, whether its marketing acknowledges it or not. The positions cluster into three archetypes.

The first archetype prioritizes security and decentralization at the expense of scalability. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum Layer 1 sit. Bitcoin processes roughly seven transactions per second. Ethereum Layer 1 handles 15 to 20. Both networks are extraordinarily secure â€” attacking either would require billions of dollars â€” and both maintain meaningful decentralization with thousands of nodes worldwide. But neither can serve as a high-throughput transaction rail on its own. The cost of a simple token transfer on Ethereum L1 can spike to 50 dollars or more during periods of congestion. That is the price of maximizing the other two properties.

The second archetype prioritizes security and scalability at the expense of decentralization. Solana is the clearest example. Solana's validators consistently sustain around 2,000 to 4,000 real user transactions per second, with sub-second finality and fees measured in fractions of a cent. The throughput is genuine and impressive. But running a Solana validator requires high-end hardware â€” fast CPUs, large amounts of RAM, high-bandwidth network connections â€” which limits who can participate. The validator set is smaller and more concentrated than Ethereum's. Solana has made a deliberate engineering decision: move fast, keep costs low, and accept that node operation will not be accessible to hobbyists running hardware in their garage. That is a legitimate choice. It is also a tradeoff.

The third archetype prioritizes decentralization and scalability at the expense of security. This is less common in mature systems because weak security tends to get exploited quickly. Some early proof-of-authority chains and low-stake testnets occupied this space, offering high throughput and broad participation but with economic security so thin that a moderately funded attacker could disrupt them. Most production systems have learned that this corner of the trilemma is the most dangerous to occupy.

## The Common Misunderstandings

Three persistent misunderstandings surround the trilemma, and each one leads builders to make bad decisions.

The first misunderstanding is that the trilemma is a temporary problem that will be solved by better technology. In January 2026, Vitalik Buterin himself claimed that Ethereum had "solved" the trilemma through its combination of Layer 2 rollups, data availability sampling via PeerDAS, and advancing ZK-EVM technology. But look carefully at what that claim actually means. Ethereum did not solve the trilemma by making Layer 1 simultaneously fast, cheap, decentralized, and secure. It solved it by layering â€” by separating execution, settlement, and data availability into different components that each make their own tradeoffs. The trilemma still applies to each individual layer. The innovation is architectural, not physical. It is like saying you solved the problem of a car being too small by attaching a trailer. The car is still the same size. You just moved some of the cargo.

The second misunderstanding is that TPS numbers tell you where a chain sits in the trilemma. They do not. A chain that claims 65,000 TPS but achieves 2,000 to 4,000 in sustained real-world usage is telling you something different than a chain that claims 15 and delivers 15. The theoretical maximum matters far less than the throughput actually achieved under production conditions, at the current level of decentralization, with the actual security guarantees in place. We will explore this in detail in subchapter 4.4.

The third misunderstanding is that the trilemma means you must pick one chain and live with its tradeoffs forever. The entire multi-chain, multi-layer architecture that defines 2026 exists precisely because different applications need different tradeoff profiles. A DeFi protocol managing billions of dollars needs maximum security and will pay for it with higher transaction costs. A gaming application processing thousands of microtransactions per second needs throughput and low latency and can tolerate a more centralized validator set. A social application needs low cost and high availability and can accept weaker finality guarantees. The trilemma does not force you into one corner. It forces you to be honest about which corner your application needs.

## Why This Matters for Builders

If you are building on a blockchain, the trilemma is the single most important constraint shaping your architecture. Every decision you make â€” which chain to deploy on, whether to use a Layer 2, how to handle finality, what security guarantees to offer users â€” is a decision about where you sit within the trilemma.

The builders who succeed are the ones who make these tradeoffs consciously, communicate them honestly, and design their systems to match the actual requirements of their users. The builders who fail are the ones who pretend the tradeoffs do not exist, who claim their chosen chain "solved" the trilemma, and who discover the constraints only after their system is live and their users are angry.

The trilemma is not a problem to be solved. It is a landscape to be navigated. Every chain has chosen a path through it. Your job as a builder is to understand where each path leads, what it costs, and whether it matches where you need to go.

The next three subchapters examine each leg of the trilemma in depth â€” starting with security: what it actually costs to attack a blockchain, and why that number is the only security metric that matters.
