# 5.5 â€” What Failed: Utility Tokens, Play-to-Earn, and Supply Chain

Why do some blockchain use cases attract billions in investment, generate genuine excitement among smart people, and still fail completely? The answer is not that the teams were incompetent or the technology was immature. The answer is that they solved problems that did not need a blockchain, or worse, created economic models that only worked during periods of growth and collapsed the moment growth stopped. This subchapter examines three categories that absorbed enormous capital and attention between 2017 and 2024 â€” utility tokens, play-to-earn gaming, and enterprise supply chain blockchain â€” and explains the structural reasons each one failed.

## The Utility Token Illusion

Between 2017 and 2019, thousands of projects raised money by issuing **utility tokens** â€” tokens that were supposed to grant access to a product or service. The pitch was always some variation of the same story: use our token to pay for storage, use our token to access our API, use our token to buy compute time on our network. The tokens were sold to investors who expected the price to appreciate as demand for the underlying service grew.

The structural problem was something economists call **the velocity problem**. A utility token that is actually used for its intended purpose circulates quickly. You buy the token, use it to access the service, the service provider sells the token for operating cash, and the token returns to the open market. The faster the token circulates, the lower the price needs to be to support the same volume of economic activity. A utility token that succeeds in its stated purpose â€” being widely used for transactions â€” puts downward pressure on its own price. The token's value as a medium of exchange directly conflicts with its value as an investment.

Consider a concrete example. A decentralized storage project launches a token. Users buy the token to pay for storage. Storage providers receive the token and immediately sell it for dollars to pay their hardware and electricity bills. The token changes hands rapidly. Even if the storage network is growing, the token price does not rise proportionally because the increased demand is offset by increased velocity. The investor who bought the token expecting it to appreciate watches the network succeed while the token price stagnates or declines. This is not a bug. It is the predictable outcome of a medium-of-exchange token with no mechanism to reduce velocity.

The projects that recognized this problem tried to solve it by adding staking mechanisms â€” locking tokens to reduce circulating supply â€” or by requiring tokens for governance. But these were patches on a fundamental design flaw. If your token exists to be spent, people will spend it and sell it. If your token exists to be held, it has no utility function. The utility token could not be both a transaction medium and a store of value. Most teams promised both and delivered neither.

By 2026, the utility token model has been largely abandoned. Legitimate decentralized infrastructure projects still have tokens, but the honest ones acknowledge that the token's value derives from governance rights, fee revenue share, or staking yield â€” not from being a medium of exchange within the application.

## Play-to-Earn: The Economics of Musical Chairs

Axie Infinity's story is the definitive case study in play-to-earn economics. At its peak in late 2021, the game had 2.7 million daily active users, primarily in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries. Players earned income by breeding digital creatures called Axies â€” represented as NFTs â€” and battling them in the game. The reward token, SLP, could be sold on exchanges for real money. At peak prices, Filipino players earned more from Axie Infinity than from local minimum-wage jobs. International media covered the phenomenon as a revolution in gaming and income generation.

The economic model was built on a foundation that mathematically could not hold. New players had to purchase Axies â€” often costing hundreds of dollars â€” to start playing. The money to pay existing players came from new players buying in. No value was being created inside the game economy. The SLP token was inflationary by design â€” the game minted new SLP every time a player won a battle, with no mechanism to remove tokens from circulation at the same rate. When the rate of new player growth slowed, the supply of SLP overwhelmed demand, and the token price collapsed.

A Cornell University study published in 2025 analyzed the Axie Infinity collapse and confirmed what critics had argued from the beginning: the game's economy required perpetual growth in the player base to sustain payouts to existing players. When growth stalled, the system experienced a death spiral. SLP's price fell more than 99 percent from its peak. Daily active users dropped from 2.7 million to roughly 350,000. Players in the Philippines who had taken out loans to buy Axies â€” some borrowing from friends and family â€” were left holding assets worth a fraction of their purchase price.

The Ronin Network hack in March 2022 accelerated the collapse but did not cause it. Attackers stole approximately 625 million dollars in Ethereum and USDC from the sidechain that processed Axie transactions. The hack destroyed trust, but the underlying economic model was already failing before the hack occurred.

The broader play-to-earn category followed the same trajectory. Games like STEPN, which rewarded users for walking, and Thetan Arena, a battle game with token rewards, all experienced the same pattern: explosive growth fueled by token speculation, followed by a collapse when new user acquisition could not keep pace with token emissions. By 2025, crypto gaming projects were shutting down in waves. Blast Royale, The Walking Dead: Empires, and The Mystery Society all suspended operations or development.

The lesson is not that games cannot involve blockchain. The lesson is that an economic model where player income depends entirely on new player investment is a zero-sum transfer, and zero-sum transfers collapse when growth ends. Games that use blockchain for genuine ownership of in-game assets â€” cosmetics, characters, items â€” without promising players a financial return may eventually succeed. But the play-to-earn model as practiced between 2021 and 2023 was a structural failure disguised as innovation.

## Enterprise Supply Chain: The Solution That Nobody Wanted

Enterprise supply chain blockchain was supposed to be the "boring but real" use case that proved blockchain's value beyond speculation. The pitch was compelling: put product provenance on an immutable ledger, and everyone in the supply chain â€” from the farmer to the retailer â€” could verify where goods came from, how they were handled, and whether they met quality standards.

IBM was the flagship. TradeLens, a joint venture between IBM and Maersk launched in 2018, aimed to digitize global shipping documentation using a permissioned blockchain. IBM Food Trust promised farm-to-shelf traceability for food products, with Walmart as its anchor customer. The ambition was enormous â€” nothing less than digitizing global trade on blockchain rails.

TradeLens shut down in early 2023 after failing to achieve commercial viability. IBM's blockchain platform reached end of support on April 30, 2023. The company that was supposed to bring blockchain to the enterprise quietly wound down the effort.

The failure had three structural causes, and understanding them teaches you when blockchain is not the right tool.

The first cause was the network effects problem. A supply chain blockchain is only useful if most participants in the supply chain are on it. If a shipping container passes through six handlers and only two of them use TradeLens, the chain of provenance is broken. But getting competitors to join a platform controlled by their competitor's joint venture â€” Maersk is the world's largest container shipping company â€” proved nearly impossible. Other shipping lines did not want to feed data into a system where Maersk had a governance advantage. The platform needed everyone to join to be useful, but no one wanted to join until everyone else already had.

The second cause was the "garbage in, garbage out" problem. A blockchain makes data immutable, but it does not make data accurate. If a supplier scans a barcode at the wrong temperature checkpoint, the blockchain faithfully records the wrong temperature. If a farmer misidentifies the origin of their produce, the blockchain immutably stores the lie. The value proposition of supply chain blockchain â€” trusted provenance â€” depends entirely on the accuracy of data entry at every point in the chain. In practice, supply chains involve thousands of small, low-margin operators with limited technology infrastructure and no incentive to invest in accurate data entry for someone else's blockchain initiative.

The third cause was the simpler alternative problem. For most supply chain traceability needs, a shared database with access controls accomplishes the same outcome as a blockchain â€” at lower cost, with faster performance, and with technology that every enterprise already understands. The specific properties that blockchain adds â€” immutability, decentralized consensus, censorship resistance â€” are valuable when participants do not trust each other and there is no central authority. But supply chains already have central authorities. Walmart can mandate what its suppliers do. Maersk can set standards for its logistics partners. In a supply chain with a dominant anchor, the trust problem that blockchain solves does not exist in the form blockchain solves it.

VeChain has survived longer than most by focusing on narrow use cases â€” luxury goods authentication, food traceability in China with Walmart as a partner â€” but its adoption remains modest relative to the original vision. Gartner research from 2024 found that only 25 percent of enterprise blockchain proof-of-concepts reached production. The supply chain sector's track record is even worse.

## The Common Pattern

These three failures â€” utility tokens, play-to-earn, and supply chain blockchain â€” share a structural pattern that every builder should internalize.

In each case, the project started with the technology and worked backward to find a problem. Utility token projects asked "how can we use a token" rather than "what problem does our user have." Play-to-earn games asked "how can we make a blockchain game" rather than "what makes a game worth playing." Supply chain platforms asked "how can we put provenance on a blockchain" rather than "why is provenance data unreliable and what is the cheapest way to fix it."

The sectors that work â€” stablecoins, institutional DeFi, tokenized assets â€” started from the opposite direction. Someone in the Philippines needed to send money home cheaply. An asset manager needed transparent, fast-settling lending markets. A fund needed to make Treasury positions composable with DeFi protocols. The problem came first. Blockchain happened to be the best available solution.

This is the filter. When you evaluate a blockchain use case, ask: if I removed the blockchain from this product, would the user still have an unsolved problem? If yes, blockchain might be part of the solution. If the user's problem could be solved with a database, an API, and a competent engineering team â€” and most problems can â€” then blockchain is adding cost and complexity without adding value.

The next subchapter examines a category that remains genuinely uncertain: the intersection of artificial intelligence and crypto.
