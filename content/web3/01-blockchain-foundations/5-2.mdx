# 5.2 â€” What Works: Stablecoins and Payments

Stablecoins are the most successful product blockchain has ever produced. Not the most exciting. Not the most talked about at conferences. The most successful, measured by the only metric that matters: sustained, growing, real-world usage that would survive even if every speculative token went to zero tomorrow.

A 318-billion-dollar market cap. Daily transfer volume that rivals Visa. Usage in over 100 countries for remittances, payroll, trade settlement, and savings. Regulatory frameworks in the United States and Europe that specifically accommodate them. If someone asks you what blockchain is actually good for in 2026, stablecoins are the answer you can give without caveats.

## Why Stablecoins Work When Other Tokens Do Not

The reason stablecoins succeed where utility tokens, governance tokens, and most other crypto assets fail is deceptively simple: they solve a real problem for people who do not care about blockchain.

A migrant worker in the Philippines sending money home does not care about consensus mechanisms. She cares that the transfer costs two dollars instead of fifteen, arrives in minutes instead of days, and does not require her family to visit a physical remittance office during business hours. A stablecoin on Solana or Tron accomplishes all three. The blockchain is invisible. The utility is obvious.

A small business owner in Turkey does not care about decentralization philosophy. He cares that his savings lose 40 percent of their purchasing power per year in Turkish lira, and that holding USDT on his phone preserves value in dollar terms without requiring a US bank account. The blockchain is a technical detail. The stable dollar is the product.

This is the critical distinction. Stablecoins are the one blockchain product where the end user does not need to understand or care about the underlying technology. Every other major blockchain use case â€” DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, tokenized assets â€” requires the user to understand at least some crypto-native concepts. Stablecoins just work like money, except better in specific, measurable ways.

## The Market Structure: USDT, USDC, and Everyone Else

The stablecoin market is a duopoly with a long tail.

USDT, issued by Tether, holds approximately 187 billion dollars in circulation and commands roughly 60 percent market share. USDT is the default unit of account in crypto trading, the most widely integrated stablecoin across exchanges, and the dominant stablecoin on Tron â€” the network that handles the highest volume of stablecoin transfers globally, particularly in emerging markets. USDT's daily trading volume routinely exceeds 100 billion dollars. On peak days, it processes more dollar-denominated volume than any traditional payment network.

USDC, issued by Circle, holds approximately 76 billion dollars and commands about 24 percent market share. USDC grew 73 percent during 2025, outpacing USDT's 36 percent growth in percentage terms, as reported by CoinDesk. The driver was regulatory positioning. Circle is a US-regulated entity that publishes monthly attestation reports from Grant Thornton, maintains reserves in cash and short-term US Treasuries at regulated custodians, and has actively positioned USDC as the compliant choice for institutions. The passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025 gave Circle a structural advantage: clear regulatory rules that Circle was already following, creating barriers for competitors who were not.

Beyond the big two, smaller stablecoins hold niche positions. DAI, now rebranded under MakerDAO's new structure, maintains a decentralized model backed by crypto collateral. PayPal's PYUSD has gained some traction through its payment network integration. Ethena's USDe introduced a synthetic dollar backed by delta-neutral hedging strategies. But none of these approach the scale or network effects of USDT and USDC.

The market structure tells you something important about how blockchain products succeed. Network effects in stablecoins are brutal. Once a stablecoin achieves deep liquidity across exchanges, wide integration across wallets, and broad acceptance in commerce, it becomes very difficult to displace. USDT and USDC have those network effects. Everyone else is fighting for scraps, unless they find a distribution channel â€” like PayPal's existing payment network â€” that bypasses the cold-start problem.

## The GENIUS Act: America's Stablecoin Framework

On July 18, 2025, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, creating the first federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. This is not a minor policy update. It is the most consequential piece of crypto legislation in US history.

The core requirements are straightforward. Every payment stablecoin issuer must maintain 100 percent reserve backing in liquid assets â€” US dollars, short-term Treasuries, or fully collateralized repurchase agreements. Issuers must publish monthly reserve composition disclosures. They must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which means full anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance programs, customer identification requirements, and risk assessments. They must possess the technical capability to freeze, seize, or burn stablecoins when legally required.

The GENIUS Act also prohibits anyone other than a permitted payment stablecoin issuer from issuing a stablecoin in the United States. Digital asset service providers cannot offer or sell a stablecoin to US persons unless it was issued by a permitted entity. This creates a licensing regime â€” you cannot just launch a stablecoin from your garage and call it compliant.

Consumer protections are built into the framework. Issuers cannot claim that their stablecoins are backed by the US government, federally insured, or legal tender. In the event of issuer insolvency, stablecoin holders' claims take priority over all other creditors. This is a significant protection that did not exist before â€” and it addresses one of the key risks that kept institutional capital on the sidelines.

The law takes full effect either 18 months after enactment or 120 days after regulators issue final implementation rules, whichever comes first. That puts the compliance deadline somewhere in late 2026 or early 2027. For builders, this means the rules are known, even if the enforcement timeline still has some flexibility.

## MiCA: Europe's Parallel Framework

The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, known as MiCA, follows a parallel but distinct path. MiCA entered into force in 2023 with a phased rollout. Rules for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens became applicable on June 30, 2024. The full framework for crypto-asset service providers took effect on December 30, 2024. Transitional periods vary by member state, with the final grandfathering deadline set for July 1, 2026.

For stablecoins specifically, MiCA requires issuers to be authorized as electronic money institutions or credit institutions within the EU. Reserve requirements mandate that at least 30 percent of reserves for significant e-money tokens be held at credit institutions. Issuers must maintain a reserve of liquid assets denominated in the same currency as the stablecoin. For stablecoins that exceed a daily transaction volume of 1 million transactions or 200 million euros, additional "significance" requirements apply, including higher capital buffers and enhanced supervisory oversight.

The practical impact has been significant. Tether has not obtained MiCA authorization for USDT in the EU, creating uncertainty about its availability to European users. Circle obtained its MiCA license for USDC in France, positioning it as the default regulated stablecoin for European markets. This regulatory divergence is reshaping the competitive landscape â€” USDC is gaining ground in regulated markets while USDT maintains dominance in jurisdictions without stablecoin-specific rules.

## Real Payment Volume: Beyond Crypto Trading

The most common criticism of stablecoin volume numbers is that they are inflated by crypto trading activity rather than reflecting "real" payments. The criticism has some merit â€” a large portion of USDT volume does flow through exchange trading pairs. But it misses the bigger picture.

Stablecoins on Tron, the blockchain with the highest stablecoin transfer volume, are overwhelmingly used for peer-to-peer transfers, not exchange trading. In emerging markets across Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, USDT on Tron has become a parallel payment rail. People use it the way they use mobile money â€” to send value to family, pay suppliers, and store savings. The transaction fees on Tron are fractions of a cent, and the transfers settle in seconds. For someone whose alternative is a bank wire that costs 25 dollars and takes three business days, the value proposition is obvious.

Cross-border B2B payments are another growing use case. Small and medium businesses in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia increasingly use stablecoins to pay international suppliers, avoiding the fees, delays, and capital controls associated with traditional correspondent banking. The process is simple: convert local currency to USDT, transfer it on-chain, and have the recipient convert to their local currency. The entire cycle can complete in under an hour at a fraction of the cost of a SWIFT transfer.

Chainalysis data shows that stablecoin adoption is highest in countries with high inflation, limited banking access, or strict capital controls â€” exactly the populations that benefit most from a borderless, censorship-resistant dollar equivalent. This is not speculative usage. It is people using a better tool for an everyday problem.

## The Risks That Remain

Stablecoins are real. They work. And they carry risks that no amount of enthusiasm should obscure.

Reserve transparency remains uneven. Circle publishes monthly attestations that are audited by a major accounting firm. Tether publishes quarterly attestation reports, but Tether has historically faced scrutiny over the composition and verification of its reserves. The GENIUS Act and MiCA will impose stricter disclosure requirements, but enforcement is still ramping up. If you are building a product that depends on a specific stablecoin maintaining its peg, you are trusting the issuer's reserve management. That trust should be informed, not assumed.

Regulatory risk has decreased but not disappeared. The GENIUS Act and MiCA provide clear frameworks, but other jurisdictions are still figuring out their approach. China bans stablecoin usage. India's stance remains ambiguous. A patchwork of rules means that a product designed for one market may face unexpected restrictions in another.

Concentration risk is real. If Tether experienced a crisis â€” a reserve shortfall, a regulatory enforcement action, a loss of banking relationships â€” the contagion would spread across every exchange, every DeFi protocol, and every payment rail that depends on USDT. That is 187 billion dollars of systemically important infrastructure, managed by a company headquartered in the British Virgin Islands. The industry has not solved this concentration problem. It has simply decided to live with it.

And depegging risk, while reduced by the new regulatory frameworks, is not zero. Algorithmic stablecoins have failed catastrophically â€” Terra's UST collapse in 2022 destroyed over 40 billion dollars in value. Even reserve-backed stablecoins have experienced temporary depegs during market stress. USDC briefly traded below 87 cents in March 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank, which held a portion of USDC reserves, collapsed. The peg recovered within days, but the episode demonstrated that "stable" is a design goal, not an immutable property.

## What Stablecoins Mean for Builders

If you are building in Web3, stablecoins are the foundation you can build on with confidence. They have the clearest product-market fit, the strongest regulatory tailwinds, and the most straightforward user value proposition of anything in the blockchain ecosystem.

Payments, remittances, cross-border settlement, payroll for distributed teams, on-chain savings products, DeFi collateral â€” stablecoins are the primitive that makes all of these possible. They are the bridge between the crypto economy and the traditional economy. They are the asset that people who have never heard of Ethereum are already using, even if they do not know it.

The regulatory frameworks now arriving in the US and Europe are not threats to stablecoins. They are tailwinds. Clear rules attract institutional capital. Institutional capital deepens liquidity. Deeper liquidity improves the user experience. Better user experience drives adoption. This is a virtuous cycle that is already in motion.

The next subchapter looks at the second sector that has proven its value: decentralized finance for institutional capital.
