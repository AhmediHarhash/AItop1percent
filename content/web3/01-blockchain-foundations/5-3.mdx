# 5.3 â€” What Works: DeFi for Institutions

In late 2024, a mid-sized European asset manager allocated 25 million euros to a lending pool on Aave. The yield was attractive â€” nearly three percentage points above what comparable money market instruments offered through traditional channels. The compliance team had approved the strategy. The custody integration with Fireblocks was operational. And then, twelve hours after deployment, the team discovered that a governance proposal on Aave had changed the interest rate model for their specific collateral type. The yield they had underwritten no longer existed. No one had called them. No one had sent an email. The protocol's smart contract simply executed a community vote, and the terms changed.

The asset manager did not leave DeFi. They hired two people whose entire job was monitoring governance proposals across every protocol where the firm had capital deployed. By mid-2025, they had tripled their on-chain allocation. The lesson was not that DeFi was too risky for institutions. The lesson was that institutional DeFi requires institutional infrastructure â€” and that infrastructure barely existed in 2024. By 2026, it does.

## Why Institutions Chose DeFi at All

The obvious question is why a regulated financial institution would deploy capital into a permissionless protocol when it has perfectly functional access to traditional money markets, repo agreements, and interbank lending. The answer is not ideology. It is not decentralization philosophy. It is three specific, measurable advantages that traditional infrastructure does not offer.

The first is transparency. When you lend through a traditional counterparty, you trust their balance sheet. When you lend through Aave or Compound, you can verify the protocol's total assets, outstanding borrows, utilization rate, and liquidation thresholds in real time. Every position is visible on-chain. Every liquidation is observable. This is not theoretical transparency â€” it is machine-readable, auditable, and continuous. For risk managers accustomed to quarterly reports and delayed filings, real-time balance sheet visibility is not a minor improvement. It is a category change.

The second is settlement speed. A traditional repo agreement settles T plus one or T plus two. A cross-border securities lending transaction can take three to five business days. On-chain lending settles in the time it takes for a block to confirm â€” roughly twelve seconds on Ethereum, under a second on Solana. For institutions managing large portfolios where capital efficiency matters, the difference between locking up collateral for three days and locking it up for twelve seconds is significant. It is not just speed. It is capital that can be redeployed instead of sitting in settlement limbo.

The third is composability. On-chain capital can be stacked. A tokenized Treasury position can serve as collateral for a lending position, which generates yield, which can be automatically redirected into another protocol. These are not hypothetical chains â€” they are live strategies that institutional desks run today. Traditional finance can replicate some of this with prime brokerage agreements and rehypothecation, but the on-chain version is programmable, transparent, and does not require bilateral negotiations with each counterparty.

## Who Is Actually In

The institutional DeFi landscape in 2026 is no longer a list of experiments. It is a roster of the largest financial institutions on the planet deploying real capital on public blockchains.

JPMorgan's blockchain division, now branded Kinexys, has processed over 1.5 trillion dollars in notional transaction volume since inception, averaging more than 2 billion dollars per day. In June 2025, JPMorgan launched JPMD, its USD deposit token, as a proof-of-concept on Base â€” an Ethereum Layer 2 network built by Coinbase. By late 2025, JPMD was available to institutional clients for cross-border payments, on-chain collateral, and settlement of tokenized fund redemptions. This is JPMorgan â€” the largest bank in the United States â€” running production financial infrastructure on a public blockchain.

BlackRock's BUIDL fund, tokenized by Securitize, crossed 2.4 billion dollars in assets under management by February 2026. In November 2025, BUIDL was accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance and expanded to BNB Chain. In February 2026, BlackRock partnered with Uniswap Labs to enable on-chain trading of BUIDL shares through Uniswap's decentralized exchange infrastructure. BlackRock also purchased UNI, Uniswap's governance token, as part of the arrangement. The world's largest asset manager is not just tolerating DeFi. It is participating in DeFi governance.

Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon partnered to expand institutional access to tokenized money market products. Goldman Sachs has publicly stated that improving regulation and the emergence of crypto use cases beyond trading underpin a constructive outlook for institutional DeFi. The firm's survey data shows that 35 percent of institutions cite regulatory uncertainty as their biggest barrier to adoption, while 32 percent view regulatory clarity as the top catalyst. The GENIUS Act, signed into law in July 2025, provided exactly that clarity for the US market.

## The Infrastructure That Made It Possible

The reason institutions could not participate in DeFi before 2024 was not skepticism or lack of interest. It was the absence of infrastructure that met their operational and regulatory requirements. Three layers had to be built before institutional capital could flow.

**Custody** was the first and most critical gap. An institution cannot hold private keys on a hardware wallet in someone's desk drawer. Fireblocks solved this with MPC-based custody â€” multi-party computation that distributes key shares across multiple parties so that no single person or system ever holds a complete private key. Anchorage Digital became the first federally chartered crypto bank in the US, offering regulated custody with staking, trading, and governance services. Coinbase Prime provided an integrated platform combining custody, trading, and prime brokerage services under a single regulated entity. By 2026, institutional-grade custody is a solved problem with multiple competing providers.

**Compliance-gated access** was the second gap. Public DeFi protocols are permissionless â€” anyone can interact with them. Institutions operating under anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer obligations cannot deploy capital into pools where their counterparties are anonymous. The solution was permissioned pools operating on top of permissionless protocols. Aave Arc, launched with Fireblocks as the first whitelister, provided KYC-verified liquidity pools where only approved institutions could participate. Aave later launched Horizon for real-world asset integration. Maple Finance and Clearpool Prime created similar permissioned lending markets. The model is consistent: take the transparent, composable mechanics of DeFi and wrap them in a compliance layer that satisfies regulators.

**On-chain identity and risk scoring** was the third gap. Institutions needed to assess counterparty risk in an environment where participants are pseudonymous. Providers like Chainalysis and Elliptic developed on-chain risk scoring that maps wallet addresses to risk profiles based on transaction history, source of funds, and interaction patterns with sanctioned entities. These tools gave compliance teams the ability to evaluate on-chain counterparties with a level of rigor comparable to traditional due diligence.

## Where Institutional Capital Concentrates

Institutional DeFi capital does not spread evenly across protocols. It concentrates in a handful of venues that offer the right combination of liquidity, security track record, and regulatory acceptance.

Aave is the dominant institutional lending protocol. Its multi-chain deployment across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and other networks gives institutions flexibility in choosing their preferred settlement layer. Aave's governance model â€” while it creates the monitoring burden described at the top of this subchapter â€” also provides a transparent decision-making process that institutions can participate in.

Uniswap handles the majority of institutional on-chain trading volume for tokens and, increasingly, tokenized securities. The integration with BlackRock's BUIDL fund signals that Uniswap is evolving from a crypto-native trading venue into a general-purpose decentralized exchange for financial assets.

Lido and other liquid staking protocols attract institutional capital seeking Ethereum staking yield without the operational complexity of running validator nodes. Liquid staking tokens â€” which represent staked ETH and can be used as collateral in other protocols â€” give institutions a way to earn staking rewards while maintaining capital flexibility.

The common thread is maturity. These protocols have been live for multiple years, have survived market downturns, have been extensively audited, and have track records of correct smart contract execution measured in billions of dollars processed without loss. Institutions do not allocate to innovation. They allocate to track records.

## The Risks Institutions Still Face

Institutional participation has not made DeFi risk-free. It has made the risks more manageable, but several categories remain that no amount of infrastructure can eliminate.

Smart contract risk is the foundational concern. DeFi protocols are software, and software has bugs. A vulnerability in an Aave lending pool, a Uniswap liquidity contract, or a bridge between chains could result in loss of deposited funds. Protocols mitigate this with multiple audits, bug bounties, and formal verification, but the risk is nonzero. An institution deploying 100 million dollars into a lending pool is exposed to the correctness of code in a way that a traditional bank deposit is not.

Governance risk â€” the scenario that opened this subchapter â€” is underappreciated. DeFi protocols are governed by token holders who vote on parameter changes, fee structures, collateral requirements, and protocol upgrades. An institution with a small governance token position can find itself subject to decisions made by a community with different incentives. Monitoring governance proposals is not optional for institutional participants. It is a core operational requirement.

Regulatory uncertainty has decreased but not disappeared. The GENIUS Act and MiCA provide frameworks for stablecoins and crypto-asset service providers, but DeFi-specific regulation remains undeveloped in most jurisdictions. The question of whether providing liquidity to a decentralized lending pool constitutes operating a money services business, whether automated market makers are exchanges, and whether governance token holders bear fiduciary duties to other participants â€” these questions are unanswered. Institutions are proceeding under reasonable legal interpretations, but the ground could shift.

Counterparty risk in permissioned pools is lower than in permissionless DeFi but still exists. A KYC-verified counterparty can still default on an undercollateralized loan. A whitelisted institution can still engage in risky behavior that affects the pool. The compliance wrapper reduces anonymity risk, but it does not eliminate credit risk.

## The Trajectory

Institutional DeFi in 2026 is where institutional internet usage was in 1998. The largest players are in. The infrastructure works. The regulatory frameworks are emerging. But the industry is still early enough that operational surprises â€” like the governance proposal that blindsided our European asset manager â€” are common rather than exceptional.

Goldman Sachs estimates that the GENIUS Act could unlock 1.2 trillion dollars in institutional capital for tokenization and DeFi by 2027. Whether that number proves accurate depends on regulatory execution, continued protocol security, and the willingness of traditional financial institutions to invest in the operational capabilities that on-chain finance demands.

What is not in question is the direction. Institutional capital is moving on-chain. The infrastructure to support it exists. The question has shifted from "will institutions use DeFi" to "how fast will they scale." For builders, this means the next wave of DeFi products will not be designed for crypto-native traders. They will be designed for compliance officers, risk managers, and portfolio allocators at firms managing trillions.

The next subchapter examines another sector that has crossed from experiment to production: real-world asset tokenization.
