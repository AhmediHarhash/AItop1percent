# Chapter 4 â€” The Trilemma and the Engineering of Tradeoffs

Every blockchain makes tradeoffs. Security, decentralization, scalability â€” you cannot maximize all three simultaneously. This is not a temporary limitation waiting for a breakthrough. It is an engineering constraint rooted in the physics of distributed systems: the more nodes that must agree, the slower the system; the faster you want it, the fewer nodes can participate; the fewer nodes, the easier to attack.

This chapter breaks down what each dimension actually means, why TPS is the wrong metric for scalability, how Layer 2 rollups move execution off-chain, the difference between optimistic and zero-knowledge approaches, why data availability is the hidden bottleneck everyone ignores, and how the modular blockchain thesis reshapes architecture decisions. By the end, you will have a decision framework for choosing the right tradeoff profile for your application.

## What This Chapter Covers

- **4.1** â€” The trilemma is real
- **4.2** â€” Security: what it costs to attack
- **4.3** â€” Decentralization: who can shut it down
- **4.4** â€” Scalability: TPS is the wrong metric
- **4.5** â€” Layer 2: scaling by moving execution off-chain
- **4.6** â€” Rollups: optimistic vs ZK
- **4.7** â€” Data availability: the hidden bottleneck
- **4.8** â€” The modular blockchain thesis
- **4.9** â€” Choosing your tradeoff profile
- **4.10** â€” Why the trilemma has not been solved (and that is fine)

*The teams that build successfully are not the ones chasing the chain that "solved" the trilemma. They are the ones who chose the right tradeoffs for their use case and built accordingly.*
