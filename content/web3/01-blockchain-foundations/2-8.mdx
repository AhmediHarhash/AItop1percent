# 2.8 — Why Consensus Design Matters for Builders
Scope: Web3

## Consensus Determines Your Latency
Every design choice sets user-perceived delay.

If your product expects instant response, you cannot ignore chain timing.

## Consensus Determines Your Cost
More security depth and broader validator set assumptions increase infrastructure and fee burden.

You should map these costs before pricing and go-to-market.

## Consensus Determines Finality
Finality choice drives when you should settle, expose balances, and allow irreversible actions.

Every withdrawal flow inherits this logic.

## Reorganizations Break Assumptions
Temporary reorgs can invalidate actions that were displayed as final.

Your app must stage irreversible actions behind explicit confidence requirements.

## Consensus Determines Censorship Resistance
If a few actors can block or reorder broadly, decentralization claims weaken quickly.

Your user trust can drop faster than technical fixes can recover.

## MEV and Your Users
MEV changes ordering and transaction outcomes.

For users, this appears as fairness and slippage issues. For you, it is a product expectation issue.

## Practical Implications by Application Type
A lending application has a different consensus risk profile than a game or identity platform.

Never apply one template across all product categories.

## L2 Consensus: Inherited Security, Independent Sequencing
Layer two systems can inherit base security while using a separate ordering layer.

This improves scalability but requires clear boundary assumptions in your architecture.

## The Builder's Consensus Checklist
Check finality rules, fork behavior, validator economics, and incident response before launch.

If any item is unknown, the architecture is not ready.

## From Black Box to First Principle
A good builder never hides consensus from operations.
