Scope: Web3

# Chapter 1 â€” The Machine Nobody Explains

Ask someone what a blockchain is and you will get one of three answers: a distributed ledger, a chain of blocks, or something about decentralization. All three are technically true. None of them help you build anything.

A blockchain is a replicated state machine â€” a computer that thousands of participants run simultaneously, agreeing on every state transition without trusting each other. Until you understand this, everything else in Web3 sits on a foundation you cannot reason about. This chapter builds that foundation from the ground up: what state means, how transitions work, why blocks exist, who runs the nodes, what smart contracts actually make possible, and where the hard boundaries are.
