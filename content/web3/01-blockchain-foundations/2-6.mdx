# 2.6 — Fork Choice and Chain Selection
Scope: Web3

## Forks Are Normal, Not Exceptional
Forks happen from temporary disagreement.

Systems resolve forks by rule, then converge. You need those rules tuned to your risk tolerance.

## Bitcoin's Fork Choice: Follow the Work
Chains that follow accumulated work reward sustained resource commitment.

This gives a stable resolution path in permissionless environments.

## Ethereum's Fork Choice: LMD-GHOST
Some PoS models use validator signals to pick the chain branch.

That puts active participation into fork resolution, not just raw history.

## Reorgs: When the Chain Changes Its Mind
Reorganizations are expected in many systems.

Deep reorgs are rare but can be expensive for systems that assume immediate finality.

## MEV and the Incentive to Reorg
MEV can motivate strategic ordering and selective inclusion.

If your economics assume neutral ordering, you are already exposed.

## Proposer-Builder Separation
Separating proposer and block construction roles can reduce leaks and improve fairness under certain conditions.

It also changes where trust and monitoring must be concentrated.

## Hard Forks and Soft Forks: When the Protocol Itself Splits
Hard forks change consensus rules and often require broader ecosystem alignment.

Soft forks tighten rules under compatibility constraints.

## Fork Choice Across Other Chains
Each chain class balances speed, safety, and participation differently.

Do not judge by headline throughput alone.

## How Fork Choice Affects Your Application
Application architecture must define when actions are safe across branch uncertainty.

This is especially critical for settlement, treasury movements, and automated exits.

## The Fork Choice Decision You Inherit
You inherit fork logic through chain choice, then build mitigation around it.

No builder escapes this baseline.
