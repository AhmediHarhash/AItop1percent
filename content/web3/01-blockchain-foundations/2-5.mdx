# 2.5 — Validators, Staking, and the Economics of Security
Scope: Web3

## What Validators Actually Do
Validators propose blocks, attest to proposals, and maintain consensus continuity.

They are operational participants, not passive network nodes.

Their reliability directly affects chain security and user trust.

## Who Validates: The Full Spectrum
Validation can be solo, pooled, or service-mediated.

Each model changes the control distribution, operational risk, and user custody pattern.

## Validator Economics: What They Earn
Rewards come from blocks and fees, and these must cover hardware and uptime.

Reward compression changes participation quality and can increase concentration.

## What Validators Spend
Hardware, monitoring, cloud, and response readiness are real costs.

Operational errors become security risk when participants drop out at bad times.

## The 32 ETH Barrier and Liquid Staking
High fixed minimums can exclude direct operators.

Liquid staking expands access, but shifts custody and control dynamics.

## Penalties: Inactivity, Slashing, and the Cost of Failure
Missed duties and malicious behavior reduce rewards and can lock capital.

This enforces discipline while introducing strict operational accountability.

## Validator Concentration: The Uncomfortable Reality
Concentration can appear in pools, not only in named actors.

Effective influence can centralize quickly under convenience and efficiency pressure.

## The Security Budget: What It All Adds Up To
Security budget is the value required to break the system versus expected attack gains.

If that budget falls, your risk model must change before production launch.

## Running a Validator: The Operational Reality
Runbooks, key security, outage playbooks, and update cadence are mandatory.

Most incidents come from process gaps, not novel mathematics.

## Solana's Validator Landscape
Some ecosystems rely on highly synchronized validator operations.

This can create speed advantages but requires sustained operational maturity.

## Why Validator Economics Matter for Builders
Your chain choice must include operator economics, not just smart contract features.

If operator failures happen at scale, your product users absorb the fallout.

Next chapter turns to how chains choose one fork after a split.
