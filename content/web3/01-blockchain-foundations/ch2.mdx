*By the end of this section you should be able to map each chain architecture to three questions: what can be decided, how long it should take, and what you can pay for when it goes wrong.*

Currentness check: these concepts are written as mechanism-level patterns observed in 2026 architecture practice. Any deployment-specific timeline or feature state is treated as directional unless publicly confirmed for the given protocol.
