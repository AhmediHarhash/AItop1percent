# Chapter 2 — How Consensus Actually Works
Scope: Web3

# 2.x in one sentence: you can move value between strangers only if every node can agree on one true history.

*At the end of this chapter, you should be able to pick a chain model and predict which product risk it removes and which it creates.*

Currentness check: these consensus models are framed using 2026-era status and architecture patterns. Any item marked as ongoing is speculative and should be treated as directional until protocol-level deployment status is confirmed.
