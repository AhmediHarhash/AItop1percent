# 2.2 — Proof of Work: The Original Answer
Scope: Web3

## How Mining Actually Works
Mining turns a transaction stream into a block race. Builders package actions into a block and a miner searches for a valid block output under a target.

The miner who solves first earns block rewards and transaction fees. This is not a central scheduler. It is permissionless block selection by cost and computation.

If you want to understand why this works with no central operator, the next section explains how timing stays stable.

## The Difficulty Adjustment
Difficulty changes over time to keep block intervals near target. If blocks are too fast, mining gets harder. If too slow, it gets easier.

This loop keeps chain rhythm predictable without one party controlling issuance.

Without this loop, transaction timing becomes a moving policy target and user expectations collapse.

## Why This Solves Byzantine Fault Tolerance
PoW defends agreement by turning block proposals into costly work. Rewriting honest history means repeating the same costly process at scale.

The system does not stop lying by permission. It makes lying economically irrational in normal operation.

You now see why attack cost is the security variable.

## The 51 Percent Attack
If one coalition controls majority mining power, it can influence ordering and revert probabilities. Even brief dominance can weaken finality assumptions.

Defenses are not perfect. They come from active monitoring, concentration controls, and ecosystem readiness.

The next section shows how this attack model changes over reward cycles.

## The Halving Cycle
Reward schedules reduce issuance over fixed intervals. That shifts miner economics and can alter how much raw work secures the chain.

Security is dynamic. It depends on what participation and revenue conditions look like at any moment.

This is why long-term security planning is part of consensus design.

## The ASIC Arms Race
Specialized hardware can increase efficiency, but it can also concentrate mining power.

The protocol may remain secure while participation shape becomes more concentrated.

The key for builders is not panic, it is risk visibility.

## Mining Economics
Any participant weighs reward, electricity, hardware cost, and failure rate. This determines who stays active.

If margins shrink too much, total active security can shrink too.

Security and usability are linked through this budget.

## Mining Pools and the Centralization Concern
Pools democratize mining access while shifting control to operators who coordinate many small participants.

This lowers entry barriers but may increase centralization of effective influence.

Designers should track both participant count and effective control.

## The Longest Chain Rule
In PoW chains, canonical history often follows the branch with strongest accumulated valid work. This gives a deterministic repair path after temporary forks.

It is not impossible to fork. It is possible to reconcile after delay.

Your product must know which actions require that reconciliation delay.

## Energy Consumption: The Central Debate
PoW security requires energy usage. That fuels debate over environmental cost and long-run sustainability.

The practical question is still the same: can the chain keep the security budget while staying adoptable for users and builders?

If you need very low friction for mainstream flows, your protocol choice may still need reevaluation.

## Proof of Work's Track Record
PoW has secured large ecosystems through major periods of stress. It has also faced long-running concerns around concentration and emissions.

The lesson is not simple praise or rejection. It is use-case alignment.

Next, the transition path moved toward bonded-security systems.

## What Builders Take from Proof of Work
PoW teaches one durable lesson: security is funded, not free. Every open chain must pay for trust through measurable, enforceable costs.

Use this lesson when deciding whether a chain model supports your reliability and adoption goals.

Next chapter shows how stake replaced work as the main security asset.
