# 2.2 Proof of Work: The Original Answer
Scope: Web3

## Why Resource Cost Was the First Solution
Proof of Work converts consensus into an expensive behavior problem.

Mechanism. A participant must solve a puzzle with measurable cost before a block proposal is accepted.

Example. When participation requires real resource expenditure, constant fake proposals become uneconomical.

Detection. Track hash power concentration, block interval variance, and stale block rates.

Mitigation. Favor robust monitoring and adaptive difficulty assumptions when you model risk.

Failure consequence. Without cost calibration, the security budget can be guessed by an attacker sooner than by you.

## How Blocks Enter the Chain
Mining is a permissionless selection process in which many proposals compete.

Mechanism. Nodes validate proofs and accept the branch with strongest accumulated valid effort.

Example. Temporary fork branches are expected, but the branch with more valid work gains preference.

Detection. Measure branch competition and the cost required for depth recovery.

Mitigation. Design action timing around realistic fork and confirmation assumptions.

Failure consequence. Action plans built without fork recovery fail during stress.

## Difficulty Adjustment as Rhythm Control
Rhythm control keeps block production near a target despite changing participation.

Mechanism. Protocols adjust puzzle threshold based on observed block timing.

Example. If blocks arrive too fast, difficulty rises; if blocks stall, it falls.

Detection. Plot interval drift over multiple windows and compare with expected band.

Mitigation. Treat unusual drift as a security and performance signal.

Failure consequence. Unstable rhythm cascades into unstable user expectations.

## The Economic Barrier Against Rewrite Attacks
Rewriting history costs resources.

Mechanism. To reverse recent state, an attacker must recreate valid proofs at scale.

Example. An economically backed attacker path must usually sustain cost over multiple blocks.

Detection. Watch sustained concentration moves and sudden hashrate exits.

Mitigation. Include resource concentration analysis in your risk dashboard.

Failure consequence. If rewrite cost falls under projected gain, settlement assumptions degrade.

## Why PoW Stayed Relevant
PoW remains a reference model for open membership and permissionless security.

Mechanism. The model proves that trust can emerge without centralized scheduling.

Example. Open miner markets still show the same attack tradeoff patterns even as ecosystems evolve.

Detection. Compare open-market resilience across long periods, not just average days.

Mitigation. Choose PoW only when your product can absorb its participation and energy profile.

Failure consequence. Ignoring this profile makes sustainability and cost assumptions collapse late.

## Energy and Public Pressure as a Design Constraint
Resource model interacts with social and regulatory pressure.

Mechanism. Even strong cryptographic security cannot ignore external operating constraints.

Example. If jurisdictional pressure rises, participation geography can shift quickly.

Detection. Monitor policy and infrastructure indicators alongside technical metrics.

Mitigation. Include alternative chain strategies if your deployment context changes.

Failure consequence. You can become technically secure but practically unviable.

## The Transition to Stakeed Models
PoW made security expensive in electricity and hardware.

Mechanism. PoS moved that cost into locked value while preserving adversarial economics.

Example. Later sections build on this shift to examine bonded security.

Detection. If you already know your product can tolerate slower finality, PoW may still fit some use cases.

Mitigation. Select by risk and economics, not tradition.

Failure consequence. Wrong baseline choice locks you into avoidable operational constraints.
