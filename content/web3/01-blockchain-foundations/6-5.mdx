# 6.5 â€” The Sequencing Layer: Who Orders Your Transactions

Every transaction you submit to a Layer 2 rollup passes through a single chokepoint before it reaches the chain. That chokepoint is the **sequencer**, and in 2026, on virtually every major rollup, it is a single server controlled by a single company. Arbitrum's sequencer is run by Offchain Labs. Base's sequencer is run by Coinbase. Optimism's sequencer is run by the Optimism Foundation. Your transactions, your swaps, your deposits â€” all of them flow through one entity that decides the order in which they are processed, which ones are included, and which ones are delayed.

This is the trust assumption that most rollup users do not realize they are making. And it is the layer of the stack where the gap between decentralized ideals and operational reality is widest.

## What a Sequencer Actually Does

The sequencer's job is deceptively simple. It receives incoming transactions from users, puts them in an order, groups them into batches, and submits those batches to the data availability layer. Think of it as the cashier at a busy checkout counter: customers arrive, the cashier decides who goes next, processes them in sequence, and sends the receipt to the back office.

In more technical terms, the sequencer performs three functions. First, it accepts transactions. When you submit a swap on a rollup-based DEX, your transaction goes to the sequencer's mempool â€” a waiting area for unprocessed transactions. Second, it orders those transactions. The sequencer decides the sequence in which pending transactions are executed. In traditional Ethereum, miners and validators perform this function through a competitive auction. On a rollup, the sequencer does it unilaterally. Third, it batches and posts. The sequencer groups ordered transactions into compressed batches and submits them to the DA layer â€” either Ethereum blobs or a dedicated DA layer like Celestia â€” along with the resulting state root.

The sequencer also provides something users care about deeply: **soft confirmations**. When you submit a transaction to a rollup, the sequencer immediately tells you "your transaction will be included." This is not final settlement â€” that happens later, when the batch is posted to the DA layer and verified by the settlement layer. But from the user's perspective, the soft confirmation is the moment the transaction feels done. It is why rollups feel fast. The sequencer promises inclusion, and the user moves on. If the sequencer were slow, unreliable, or dishonest about soft confirmations, the entire user experience would collapse.

## The Centralization Problem

Here is where the map gets uncomfortable. The entire security narrative of rollups rests on the idea that they inherit Ethereum's security. That is true for settlement â€” fraud proofs and validity proofs are verified on Ethereum, and the economic security of Ethereum's validator set backs those verifications. But at the sequencing layer, there is no decentralization. There is one company running one server.

A centralized sequencer can do things that a decentralized network cannot. It can censor transactions â€” refusing to include a specific user's transaction or a specific type of transaction. In theory, users can bypass a censoring sequencer by submitting transactions directly to the L1 through a mechanism called **forced inclusion**, but this is slower, more expensive, and requires technical sophistication that most users do not have. It is an escape hatch, not a viable alternative.

A centralized sequencer can extract **MEV** â€” maximal extractable value â€” by reordering transactions to profit from the information advantage. If the sequencer sees your large swap before it is executed, it can insert its own transaction ahead of yours (front-running) or arrange transactions to capture arbitrage opportunities. On Ethereum L1, MEV extraction is distributed across a competitive ecosystem of searchers, builders, and validators. On a rollup with a centralized sequencer, that extraction is a monopoly.

A centralized sequencer is a single point of failure. If the sequencer goes down, the rollup stops producing blocks. Users cannot transact. DeFi positions cannot be managed. Liquidations cannot occur. This has happened in practice â€” both Arbitrum and Optimism have experienced sequencer outages that temporarily halted the chain. The outages were brief, measured in minutes to hours, and the teams resolved them quickly. But the architectural reality is that the liveness of a billion-dollar ecosystem depends on the uptime of a single server.

## The Revenue Model

Understanding how sequencers make money clarifies why decentralization is progressing slowly.

The sequencer collects gas fees from every transaction it processes. On a busy rollup, this adds up to significant revenue. The sequencer then pays a fraction of those fees for data availability â€” posting batches to Ethereum blobs or a dedicated DA layer. The difference between what the sequencer collects in fees and what it pays for DA and settlement is the sequencer's margin.

This margin is substantial. Base contributed 44.8 percent of the Optimism Collective's total revenue in October 2025 â€” roughly 245 ETH in a single month from one chain. Across the major rollups, sequencer revenue runs into tens of millions of dollars annually. The entity that controls the sequencer controls the revenue.

This creates an obvious tension. Decentralizing the sequencer means distributing that revenue across a wider set of participants. For the companies that built and launched these rollups â€” Offchain Labs, Coinbase, the Optimism Foundation â€” decentralizing the sequencer means giving up a concentrated revenue stream. They have all committed to decentralization roadmaps, but the financial incentives to move slowly are real.

## Shared Sequencing: One Sequencer for Many Rollups

One approach to solving the centralization problem is shared sequencing. Instead of every rollup running its own sequencer, multiple rollups share a single decentralized sequencer network. Two projects are leading this effort.

**Espresso Network** is building a shared sequencer that multiple rollups can plug into instead of running their own centralized sequencer. Espresso uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that allows permissionless participation â€” anyone can stake and participate in sequencing. The network provides censorship resistance (no single entity controls transaction ordering), fast confirmations (soft commitments in seconds), and cross-rollup composability (transactions on different rollups sharing the same sequencer can be ordered atomically). Espresso launched its mainnet in 2025 and is scaling to support thousands of consensus nodes.

**Astria** takes a similar but architecturally distinct approach. Astria describes itself as a decentralized shared sequencing layer that any rollup can join permissionlessly. Astria launched its mainnet alpha in late 2024 and provides rollups with fast block confirmations, censorship resistance, and the ability to coordinate transactions across multiple rollups. The core value proposition is the same as Espresso's: replace the single-company sequencer with a decentralized network, and let rollups share the benefits.

The challenge for both projects is adoption. A shared sequencer only delivers value if rollups actually use it. And for rollups that currently control their own sequencer â€” and collect the revenue from doing so â€” the incentive to switch to a shared model is not straightforward. The technical benefits are real. The economic incentives are complicated.

## Based Sequencing: Let Ethereum Do It

A more radical approach eliminates the separate sequencer entirely. **Based sequencing**, proposed by Ethereum researcher Justin Drake in 2023, hands transaction ordering back to Ethereum's L1 validators. Instead of a rollup running its own sequencer, the next Ethereum block proposer permissionlessly includes the rollup's transactions in the next L1 block. The rollup delegates its sequencing to Ethereum's existing decentralized validator set.

The advantage is immediate and deep decentralization. Ethereum has hundreds of thousands of validators distributed across the globe. A based rollup inherits that entire validator set for its sequencing, which means no single entity controls transaction ordering, no centralized point of failure, and no concentrated MEV extraction. Censorship resistance comes from Ethereum's existing censorship resistance properties.

Taiko is the most prominent project pursuing based sequencing. Taiko launched its mainnet in 2024 with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposing the inaugural block â€” a symbolic endorsement of the approach. In a based rollup, anyone who can propose an Ethereum block can include rollup transactions. There is no sequencer to decentralize because there is no separate sequencer at all.

The tradeoff is performance. Ethereum produces blocks every 12 seconds. A rollup using based sequencing cannot confirm transactions faster than Ethereum's block time without additional mechanisms. Most centralized sequencers provide soft confirmations in under a second. Based sequencing trades that speed for decentralization. Research into **preconfirmations** â€” mechanisms that allow L1 proposers to commit to including specific transactions before the block is produced â€” aims to close this gap, but in 2026, based rollups are inherently slower at soft confirmation than their centralized-sequencer counterparts.

The second tradeoff is MEV distribution. In a based rollup, MEV flows to Ethereum validators rather than to the rollup's ecosystem. For Ethereum, this is positive â€” it strengthens the economic security of the L1. For the rollup and its community, it means value leakage. MEV that would have stayed within the rollup's economy is instead captured by Ethereum's validator set. Whether this is a feature or a bug depends on whether you prioritize rollup sovereignty or Ethereum alignment.

## The Decentralization Roadmap

Every major rollup has published a decentralization plan for its sequencer, and the timelines are worth tracking.

Arbitrum's roadmap includes a transition to a decentralized sequencer, though the specific timeline and mechanism remain under development. Optimism has discussed sequencer decentralization as part of its Superchain vision, where multiple OP Stack chains share infrastructure. Base, as part of the Optimism Collective, follows the same roadmap. StarkNet has committed to full sequencer decentralization by 2026, with all validators running their own sequencing nodes. zkSync's roadmap includes multi-node sequencing testnets by late 2025 and fully open participation in 2026.

The pattern across all of these is consistent: public commitment to decentralization, genuine technical work toward it, but no rush to give up control. The teams building these rollups understand that centralized sequencers are an architectural liability and a philosophical contradiction with blockchain's core value proposition. They also understand that centralized sequencers are operationally simpler, more performant, and more profitable. Balancing those realities is the defining governance challenge of the rollup era.

## What This Means for Your Architecture

If you are building on a rollup, the sequencer is the most opaque part of the stack. You do not choose it. You do not configure it. You do not see it in your application code. But it shapes your user experience, your cost structure, and your trust assumptions in ways that matter.

When evaluating a rollup for deployment, ask three questions about its sequencer. First, who runs it and what are their incentives? A sequencer run by the same company that profits from the rollup's growth has aligned incentives but centralization risk. Second, what happens if the sequencer goes down? Does the rollup have a forced inclusion mechanism that lets users submit transactions directly to L1? How long does recovery take? Third, what is the decentralization plan, and is it progressing? A rollup that has been promising sequencer decentralization for two years without shipping anything is telling you something about its priorities.

The sequencer determines who orders your transactions today. The next three to five years will determine whether that power stays concentrated or is distributed across the network. For builders, the practical implication is to design your application so that it does not depend on sequencer-specific behavior â€” ordering guarantees, timing assumptions, or MEV protection that only works with a specific sequencer implementation. Build for the decentralized future even while deploying on the centralized present.

The sequencer orders transactions and posts them to the DA layer. But the final layer of the stack â€” the one your users actually touch â€” is the application layer, where wallets, interfaces, and user experiences translate all of this infrastructure into products people use. That is where the next subchapter takes us.
