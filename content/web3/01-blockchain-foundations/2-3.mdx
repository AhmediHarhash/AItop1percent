# 2.3 Proof of Stake: Trust Through Economic Skin in the Game
Scope: Web3

## The Security Shift
Proof of Stake keeps open participation but changes the cost from hardware to capital.

Mechanism. Participants lock value, validate based on stake, and face penalties for rule violations.

Example. Invalid behavior that was previously unprofitable through compute now becomes capital exposure.

Detection. Track staking participation, reward payout behavior, and penalty events.

Mitigation. Evaluate whether your threat model can tolerate value concentration and unstaking risk.

Failure consequence. If staking incentives drift, security assumptions erode before you notice.

## Validator Duties and Responsibilities
A validator is both a network participant and an operational role.

Mechanism. Validators propose, attest, and keep the chain moving through repeated signatures.

Example. Missed duties create weak liveness, while deliberate misuse triggers penalties.

Detection. Monitor signing uptime and missed proposal ratios per operator.

Mitigation. Build operator diversity and runbook readiness into chain selection.

Failure consequence. Operational neglect becomes a consensus risk, not just an uptime issue.

## Slashing as the Deterrent Layer
Deterrence only works when penalties are clear and enforceable.

Mechanism. Slashing reduces the attacker payoff by burning locked value for harmful behavior.

Example. A validator that signs conflicting finality paths can lose part or all of bonded capital.

Detection. Watch slashing event patterns and their false-positive profile.

Mitigation. Ensure your operational policies reduce accidental violations.

Failure consequence. Weak penalty design becomes either too soft for attack or too harsh for operations.

## Economic Concentration and Accessibility
PoS lowers hardware entry barriers but can create operator concentration.

Mechanism. Delegation and pooling move participation from many individuals to service layers.

Example. Broad ownership can still route through a small number of active operators.

Detection. Compare token holder distribution with active signer concentration.

Mitigation. Treat operator concentration as a first-class governance and security metric.

Failure consequence. Concentration risk reappears as fewer effective decision points.

## Recovery and Weak Subjectivity
Long periods of inactivity need practical checkpoints.

Mechanism. New participants often rely on trusted checkpoint references for initial security assumptions.

Example. Without strong checkpoint process, chain startup or restart can become contentious.

Detection. Audit checkpoint distribution, freshness, and verification procedures.

Mitigation. Choose chains with tested recovery governance and communication norms.

Failure consequence. Recovery ambiguity increases outage risk after major incidents.

## The Equivocation Problem
PoS must prevent actors from backing multiple conflicting histories.

Mechanism. Penalty and attestation rules raise the cost of inconsistent participation.

Example. If conflicting signatures are cheap, the network can observe parallel forks with no direct cost.

Detection. Run conflict behavior tests during stress and monitor equivocation flags.

Mitigation. Keep monitoring and enforcement logic aligned with protocol updates.

Failure consequence. You get cheap manipulation before your app sees overt breakage.

## Practical Takeaway for Builders
PoS is not automatically simpler.

Mechanism. Your risk shifts from compute cost to capital liquidity and operator discipline.

Example. A fast chain transition still needs a robust operational playbook for reward and slashing windows.

Detection. Review financial health and concentration of active validators.

Mitigation. Build liquidity and operational continuity planning before launch.

Failure consequence. Skipping this shift logic causes late surprises under stress.
