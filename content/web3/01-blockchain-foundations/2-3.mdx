# 2.3 — Proof of Stake: Trust Through Economic Skin in the Game
Scope: Web3

## The Core Mechanism
Proof of Stake replaces open computation with bonded value. Participants lock value and secure the network by validating blocks and checkpoints.

Correct behavior earns rewards. Malicious behavior faces penalties.

This shifts security from electricity and raw work to economics and collateral.

## Slashing: The Punishment That Makes It Work
Slashing is the explicit penalty for protocol abuse.

Its goal is simple: do not reward the right to propose and sign while hiding malicious intent.

If slashing exists, attacks are no longer just technical failures. They become collateral failures.

## Slashing in Practice
Slashing works only with clear rules and reliable detection.

Ambiguous rules create false positives and weaker social trust. Weak rules create exploitable behavior.

Builders must monitor slashing patterns as part of production ops.

## The Merge: The Largest Transition in Blockchain History
The major chain migration from one consensus model to another proved that deep consensus changes can be executed without resetting state.

It also proved that upgrade coordination, client readiness, and social process are part of consensus itself.

This path informs every modern upgrade plan.

## Validator Economics
Validators earn rewards for proposing and attesting. Their returns fund long-term participation.

When participation costs exceed returns, consolidation can rise and resilience can weaken.

You cannot measure network security without validator economic health.

## Staking Concentration in Practice
Even with many token holders, operational control can concentrate in large pools and service operators.

This can increase performance simplicity but reduces diversity assumptions.

Assess concentration not just as market share, but as protocol governance risk.

## Advantages Over Proof of Work
PoS usually lowers energy demand and can improve efficiency. It often supports faster iteration in protocol-level parameters.

But it changes attack surface toward economic extraction and concentration points.

Design for these new edges.

## Long-Range Attacks and Weak Subjectivity
If historical data is older than active participants can validate from scratch, weak subjectivity checkpoints provide a practical anchor.

Without trusted checkpoints, chain recovery can become a prolonged security argument.

This is not a weakness; it is a social and technical guardrail.

## The Nothing-at-Stake Problem
Without penalties, validators could sign conflicting histories with little downside. Slashing and penalties make this behavior costly.

Protocol design forces a validator to choose one honest path as the safe route.

Now move to variants and delegations.

## Delegated Proof of Stake and Other Variants
Delegation lets many users participate through operators, reducing minimum barrier.

It improves access but introduces custody and operator trust.

The tradeoff is familiar: lower friction, higher service risk.

## What Proof of Stake Changed for Builders
PoS makes security economics part of your architecture checklist: return rates, penalty design, concentration, and social governance.

No longer can you only think in code. You must think in incentives.

## The Fundamental Trade-Off
PoS lowers one operational class and increases another.

Lower energy and fast iteration do not eliminate slashing, concentration, and governance complexity.

The final lesson is in how PoS changes your finality model.

Next chapter deepens this in finality design.
