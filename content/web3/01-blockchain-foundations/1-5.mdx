# 1.5 Nodes: Who Runs the Machine
Scope: Web3

## Nodes as Guardians of State
Nodes are the active organs of the network.

Mechanism. They hold data, validate blocks, and relay state updates. Without healthy nodes, consensus cannot be measured or enforced.

Example. A geographically concentrated node set can fail together under infrastructure events.

Detection. Watch node diversity and peer quality across regions.

Mitigation. Diversify provider footprint and client versions.

Failure consequence. A shallow node set turns one outage into systemwide blind spot.

## Node Roles Matter
Not all nodes are equal.

Mechanism. Full nodes verify rules and store state, while lighter nodes rely on others for proofs.

Example. A payment dapp can function with light clients, but fraud detection still needs full node trust paths.

Detection. Map node role coverage for each critical flow.

Mitigation. Keep explicit assumptions on where your product reads and verifies.

Failure consequence. Critical operations become dependent on unverified assumptions.

## Peer Sampling and Information Flow
Nodes discover each other and exchange blocks and state data.

Mechanism. Peer topology affects propagation speed and failure visibility.

Example. Tight peer graphs can delay awareness of reorgs and inclusion changes.

Detection. Track inbound peer churn and propagation delays.

Mitigation. Require enough independent peer sources and diverse routes.

Failure consequence. Weak peer diversity causes stale or skewed state assumptions.

## Validator and Non Validator Difference
Some nodes propose and attest, others mostly verify.

Mechanism. Separation supports decentralization and prevents all power from collapsing into one role.

Example. A verifier node can detect invalid blocks even if it never proposes.

Detection. Track proposer and attester role health separately.

Mitigation. Don’t assume proposer activity implies full security posture.

Failure consequence. Collapsed role diversity increases single-path failure risk.

## Operational Discipline in Node Management
Nodes need updates, monitoring, key safety, and incident playbooks.

Mechanism. Protocol correctness and operational correctness are jointly required.

Example. One outdated node version across many operators creates synchronized fail modes.

Detection. Audit upgrade cadence and miss rates.

Mitigation. Use staged rollout and rollback readiness.

Failure consequence. Infrastructure drift becomes consensus drift.

## Network-Level Reliability
Node behavior is constrained by transport reliability.

Mechanism. Latency and packet loss can fragment views even with perfect protocol rules.

Example. A region with poor routing can produce delayed block acceptance.

Detection. Correlate network health with state arrival lag.

Mitigation. Build routing redundancy into node deployment.

Failure consequence. A node outage pattern can mimic consensus failure.

## Why Node Diversity Is a Product Decision
You cannot design the app without selecting node trust assumptions.

Mechanism. Your required service reliability sets the minimum node diversity floor.

Example. If treasury movement depends on few sources, trust is narrower than marketing implies.

Detection. Audit source diversity for every oracle and balance feed.

Mitigation. Expand sources and verify consistency before action.

Failure consequence. Reduced diversity becomes a hidden concentration point.

## Bridge
Next we make programmability explicit and tie this machine model to executable logic.
