# 5.4 â€” What Works: Real-World Asset Tokenization

Tokenization of real-world assets is the most important bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, and in 2026 it is no longer a theory. The on-chain RWA market â€” excluding stablecoins â€” has grown roughly fivefold in three years, from under 7 billion dollars in early 2023 to more than 33 billion dollars by late 2025, with end-of-2026 projections exceeding 50 billion. Tokenized US Treasuries alone account for approximately 8.7 billion of that total. This is not speculative token trading. This is real financial instruments â€” government bonds, private credit, real estate, commodities â€” represented as tokens on public blockchains, held by real institutions, and generating real yield.

## What Tokenization Actually Means

**Tokenization** is the process of creating a digital representation of a real-world asset on a blockchain. The token does not replace the asset. It represents a legal claim on it. When BlackRock tokenizes a share of its Treasury fund, the underlying US government bonds still exist in a custodial account at Bank of New York Mellon. The token on Ethereum is a digital receipt that entitles the holder to their proportional share of the fund's value.

This distinction matters because it determines what tokenization can and cannot do. Tokenization does not change the nature of the underlying asset. A tokenized Treasury bill is still a Treasury bill â€” same credit risk, same yield, same duration. What tokenization changes is the infrastructure layer: how the asset is issued, traded, settled, and composed with other financial instruments. The asset stays the same. The rails change.

The mechanism works through a legal wrapper. A traditional entity â€” typically a special purpose vehicle or an investment trust â€” holds the real-world asset. That entity issues tokens on a blockchain, with each token representing a fractional interest in the underlying assets. A transfer agent, like Securitize, manages the mapping between on-chain token holders and the legal ownership records. A custodian holds the physical or financial assets. Smart contracts handle the on-chain mechanics: transfers, dividend distributions, compliance checks, and redemptions.

## Why Tokenization Works

Tokenization solves four specific problems that traditional financial infrastructure handles poorly.

The first is settlement time. Traditional securities settle T plus one or T plus two â€” meaning one or two business days after the trade. Cross-border transactions involving multiple custodians and clearinghouses can take even longer. Tokenized assets settle on-chain in seconds to minutes, depending on the blockchain. For a fund manager executing a portfolio rebalancing across multiple asset classes, reducing settlement from days to seconds is not a convenience. It is a capital efficiency gain measured in basis points of return.

The second is fractional ownership. A single US Treasury bond has a minimum denomination of 100 dollars, but participating in a diversified Treasury fund through traditional channels typically requires minimum investments of 100,000 dollars or more. Tokenized Treasury products like Ondo Finance's USDY or BlackRock's BUIDL allow fractional positions with much lower minimums. This opens access to asset classes that were previously available only to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals.

The third is programmable compliance. Traditional securities enforce compliance through human processes â€” broker-dealers check accreditation status, transfer agents verify identity, compliance officers review transaction reports. Tokenized securities can embed compliance rules directly in the smart contract. A token can be programmed to transfer only between verified wallets, to enforce holding period restrictions, to automatically withhold and distribute tax payments, and to block transactions involving sanctioned addresses. The compliance is not a layer on top of the asset. It is built into the asset itself.

The fourth is composability with DeFi. A tokenized Treasury position can be used as collateral in a lending protocol, posted as margin on a decentralized exchange, or bundled with other tokenized assets into a structured product â€” all without leaving the blockchain. BlackRock's BUIDL being accepted as collateral on Binance in November 2025 is a concrete example. An institution can hold a yield-bearing Treasury position and simultaneously use it as trading collateral, earning yield while maintaining market exposure. Traditional finance requires separate agreements with prime brokers to achieve something similar, and even then, the process is slower and less transparent.

## Who Is Building and What They Have Shipped

The tokenized RWA market is not dominated by crypto startups. It is being built by the largest financial institutions in the world, often in partnership with crypto-native infrastructure providers.

BlackRock's BUIDL fund is the flagship. Launched in March 2024 through a partnership with Securitize, BUIDL tokenizes shares of a fund that invests in US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. By February 2026, BUIDL held approximately 2.4 billion dollars in assets under management across multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and BNB Chain. Securitize handles the tokenization and transfer agent functions. Bank of New York Mellon serves as custodian. The fund is registered under SEC regulations and available to qualified purchasers. In February 2026, BlackRock and Uniswap Labs integrated BUIDL trading into Uniswap's decentralized exchange, making tokenized Treasuries tradeable through the same infrastructure that handles billions in crypto trading volume daily.

Ondo Finance has emerged as the leading crypto-native issuer of tokenized Treasury products. Ondo's USDY â€” backed by short-term US Treasuries and bank deposits â€” offers stable, yield-bearing exposure to US government debt. Ondo Global Markets extended this to investors outside the United States. The appeal is simplicity: hold USDY in your wallet and earn Treasury yield without needing a brokerage account, without minimum investment requirements that exclude smaller participants, and without the settlement delays of traditional money market funds.

Securitize has positioned itself as the infrastructure layer for institutional tokenization. Beyond its partnership with BlackRock, Securitize went public through a SPAC listing at a 1.25 billion dollar pre-money valuation and announced plans to launch "Stocks on Securitize" â€” natively tokenized equities rather than synthetic derivatives â€” in 2026.

Centrifuge has carved a niche in tokenized private credit, distributing over 1.3 billion dollars of tokenized assets by late 2025. In September 2025, Centrifuge created a tokenized feeder fund for the Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, bringing one of the largest alternative asset managers into the on-chain ecosystem. Active on-chain private credit now exceeds 18 billion dollars in cumulative originations.

## The Regulatory Unlock

Tokenization has long faced a chicken-and-egg problem: institutions would not tokenize assets without regulatory clarity, and regulators would not provide clarity without institutional interest. That deadlock broke in 2025.

In the United States, the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets authorized a three-year pilot program in December 2025, enabling DTCC â€” the central clearing and settlement infrastructure for US securities â€” to tokenize Russell 1000 equities, US Treasury securities, and major index ETFs. The pilot is expected to launch in the second half of 2026. This is the SEC acknowledging, through action rather than speeches, that tokenized securities are a legitimate form of financial infrastructure.

The GENIUS Act further supported the ecosystem by providing clear rules for the stablecoins that serve as the primary settlement currency for tokenized asset transactions. When a tokenized Treasury position is redeemed, the proceeds are typically paid in USDC or another regulated stablecoin. Clear stablecoin rules make the entire tokenization pipeline more predictable.

In Europe, MiCA provides a framework for crypto-assets but does not specifically address security tokens. Individual EU member states are filling the gap with national regimes. Luxembourg and France have been particularly active in creating legal frameworks for tokenized securities and fund shares.

## What Tokenization Has Not Solved

Honesty requires acknowledging what remains broken, unfinished, or genuinely hard.

The legal wrapper problem is the most fundamental. A token on Ethereum is only as good as the legal structure behind it. If the SPV that holds the underlying Treasury bonds is incorporated in a jurisdiction with weak creditor protections, or if the trust agreement has ambiguous redemption terms, the on-chain token is a claim on a fragile legal construct. Investors in tokenized assets are not just trusting the smart contract. They are trusting the law firm that drafted the offering documents, the jurisdiction that governs disputes, and the custodian that holds the assets. This is not a technical problem blockchain can solve. It is a legal infrastructure problem that requires careful structuring on a deal-by-deal basis.

Liquidity remains thin for most tokenized assets. BUIDL has deep liquidity because it is backed by BlackRock and integrated with major exchanges and DeFi protocols. But the long tail of tokenized assets â€” smaller real estate funds, niche private credit instruments, tokenized commodity positions â€” often has very limited secondary market trading. Fractional ownership is meaningless if there is no one to sell to. Building liquid secondary markets for tokenized assets is the next major infrastructure challenge.

Interoperability between chains creates friction. A tokenized Treasury on Ethereum cannot be natively used as collateral on Solana without bridging, which introduces smart contract risk and settlement complexity. The multi-chain expansion of BUIDL across six networks is a workaround, not a solution. True cross-chain interoperability for tokenized securities remains an unsolved infrastructure problem.

And oracle risk â€” the risk that the off-chain data feeding into on-chain smart contracts is incorrect or manipulated â€” is a persistent concern. A tokenized real estate fund needs an accurate valuation of the underlying properties. That valuation comes from an off-chain appraisal, fed into an on-chain oracle. If the appraisal is stale, biased, or fraudulent, the on-chain token price diverges from reality. Blockchain gives you transparent, immutable records. It does not give you truth. Truth still depends on the quality of the data entering the system.

## What This Means for Builders

If you are building in the tokenized asset space, the opportunity is real but the competitive landscape is already structured. The largest asset classes â€” Treasuries, money market funds, and investment-grade credit â€” are being tokenized by BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and other incumbents with distribution networks that startups cannot match. The opportunity for new entrants is in the long tail: asset classes that incumbents are not prioritizing, geographies where traditional financial infrastructure is weak, and infrastructure layers â€” compliance tooling, secondary market protocols, cross-chain settlement â€” that the incumbents need but have not built themselves.

Centrifuge's CEO has predicted that over 50 percent of the top 50 asset managers will have tokenization strategies by the end of 2026. McKinsey projects the total tokenized asset market could reach 2 trillion dollars by 2030. Whether these numbers prove accurate, the direction is unambiguous. Real-world assets are moving on-chain. The question is not whether, but how fast and through which channels.

The next subchapter turns from what works to what failed â€” and the failures are just as instructive as the successes.
