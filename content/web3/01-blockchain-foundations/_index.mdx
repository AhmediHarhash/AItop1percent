Scope: Web3

# Section 1 - What Blockchain Actually Is

Most people know the words of Web3, but not the machine. They say chain, wallet, token, smart contract, and assume that is enough. It is not enough to build real systems.

This section rebuilds the model from the ground up.

- What is a blockchain at its core
- How consensus keeps many computers in agreement
- Which parts you can trust and which parts are still managed
- Why performance, cost, and security tradeoffs are part of the design, not after-thoughts

You do not need one more hype model. You need a working model. That is this section.

## What You Will Learn

- **Chapter 1 - The Machine Nobody Explains:** A blockchain as a replicated state machine, how state, transitions, finality, blocks, and nodes fit together.
- **Chapter 2 - How Consensus Actually Works:** Agreement under failure, proof of work, proof of stake, fork choice, validator economics, and the security profile of each chain.
- **Chapter 3 - Trust, Security, and What You Are Actually Betting On:** Crypto trust, economic trust, social trust, bridges, sequencer centralization, oracle risk, and key management.
- **Chapter 4 - The Trilemma and the Engineering of Tradeoffs:** Security, decentralization, scale, data availability, Layer 2 models, and practical tradeoff decisions.
- **Chapter 5 - What Is Real and What Is Hype in 2026:** What is production-ready, what is still narrative, and how to separate repeatable outcomes from cycle hype.
- **Chapter 6 - The Web3 Stack: Your Map for the Rest of This Book:** Settlement, execution, availability, sequencing, and application layers.

By the end of this section, you can evaluate any architecture with a builder mindset instead of a pitch-deck mindset.
